This does not change the Food Standards Agency’s (FSA’s) top priority which is to ensure that food, whether imported or produced in the UK, remains safe and what it says it is.</p><p> </p><p>The FSA is already working hard to ensure that the high standard of food safety and consumer protection we enjoy in this country is maintained when the UK leaves the EU. The FSA is part of a cross-Government group exploring options for future border operations, but decisions on how the UK border will operate will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.</p><p> </p><p>As my Rt. hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in her Mansion House speech, the introduction of border controls on the island of Ireland would ‘be inconsistent with the commitments that both we and the EU have made in respect of Northern Ireland’. The FSA’s plans to ensure that food in the UK continues to be safe therefore do not envisage a scenario where border controls are introduced on the island of Ireland.</p><p> </p><p>The FSA will strive to ensure that controls to protect public health on imported food originated from the EU are properly risk-based and proportionate, taking account of surveillance and risk assessment findings and wider Government policy on trade. Its proposed plan reflects this objective.</p><p> </p><p>The FSA has already commenced a programme comprehensively to revise and upgrade its approach to surveillance.

There was also damage to ceilings in and around the restaurant area, and to plant and equipment in the 1 and 2 Millbank parts of the building. The total cost impact of the damage and repairs totaled approximately £84k.</p><p>At the time, 5 Great College Street was a building site and damage was minimal. There was minor disruption to the project refurbishing that building, and minor clean-up costs.</p><p><strong>Damage caused to Millbank House as a result of flooding in 2018</strong></p><p>It is not believed that the flooding in May 2018 caused any permanent damage to 1 and 2 Millbank other than the loss of catering stock; all food and stock losses will be covered by House of Lords Catering and Retail Services’ commercial insurance. There is water staining to finishes such as floors, doors and walls in the basement, and deep cleaning required to the kitchen areas.</p><p>In 5 Great College Street the flooding caused damage to finishes including floors, doors and walls in the basements; plant and equipment including air handling units, pressurisation pumps and lift equipment was also damaged by the water. The impact on costs within the 5 Great College Street project are still being assessed. There are two sets of costs. One is the emergency response costs including the tankers to pump water out and the clean-up operation. The second is the cost of impact, which will include repairs and the replacement of assets. The emergency response costs are currently estimated to be £200k. An assessment of the impact costs, which will take around 4-6 weeks, is in train.</p><p><strong>Steps to protect against future damage</strong></p><p>Following the flooding in 2016, a number of actions were taken to reduce the risk of flooding in Millbank House. Actions implemented include the sewage back flow prevention to 1 and 2 Millbank being repaired. Repair works to 1 and 2 Millbank incorporated features and materials that were less susceptible to water damage. Minor mitigation measures were incorporated into the 5 Great College Street project to prevent critical plant and equipment being seriously affected by future flooding, including waterproof bunding around critical areas and locating equipment at a higher level to reduce the risk of water damage.</p><p>Since the May flooding a review of the locations of water penetration has been undertaken and a specialist independent drainage adviser has been commissioned to determine if additional protective measures can be provided in the short term. Discussions are ongoing with systems and equipment suppliers to understand if there is any improved resilience which can be incorporated into the equipment. The recommendations of the report commissioned after the 2016 flooding are being reviewed to determine actions that could be accelerated or enhanced with new lessons learnt from the recent flooding.</p>",,"Lord Laming",,"2018-06-19T16:37:27.457Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/917760/answer","Biography information for Lord Laming","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/917760/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/917760/answer",,,,,"204",,"Senior Deputy Speaker (HoL)","2018-06-05","Millbank House: Floods","2","House of Lords","To ask the Senior Deputy Speaker what assessment he has made of the damage caused to Millbank House by flooding in 2016 and 2018; what costs have been incurred; and what steps he intends to take to ensure the building is protected against future damage.","false","Biography information for Lord Empey",,"Lord Empey","HL8354"

Last year the UK spent £7.5 million in programme funds to help strengthen the country's defence and security, improve the judiciary and modernise the economy.

In 2014, the UK and Germany launched an initiative to help the country make progress on its EU accession path and to create jobs and growth for the benefit of all BiH's citizens. We work with the police and security agencies and with the State-level judicial institutions to strengthen independence, professionalism and efficiency in tackling terrorism, organised crime and corruption. We provide support to State and sub-State institutions to improve the climate for doing business in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to strengthen the economy and to reform public administration.
