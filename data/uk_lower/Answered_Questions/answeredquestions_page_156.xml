Unplanned disruption often leads to TOCs having to incur many additional costs, including the cost of compensation to passengers, replacement bus/taxi costs, staff overtime and administration costs.

The High Court found that this was so, even in relation to the offences for which he was convicted. It is the responsibility of the Parole Board to satisfy itself that an offender is no longer a risk to the public and it has powers to request further evidence it deems appropriate. The judgement of Sir Brian Leveson is clear that the Parole Board failed in its duty here.</p><p> </p><p>The High Court found that although the sentencing remarks had been omitted, they did not detail the precise circumstances of Worboy’s offending.</p><p> </p><p>Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service submitted the dossier to the Parole Board on 26 April 2017.
