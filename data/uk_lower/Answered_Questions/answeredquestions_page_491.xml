Work is <br>ongoing with the Foreign Office on new family tracing arrangements for volume <br>UASC nationalities (Albanian and Afghan) that should help to expedite the <br>tracing process in these countries.

This has helped to <br>address the consistency of operations and outcomes in each of the seven <br>casework locations.

Unaccompanied children should receive their decisions <br>quicker than that. <br><br>In response to recommendation 8, as part of the ongoing continuous improvement <br>programme decision letters have been reviewed and changed.

Time unlocked includes time where a prisoner is either out of their cell or where the cell door is unlocked allowing them to move freely in and out of the cell.</p><p> </p><p>Time unlocked was discontinued as a performance indicator for prisons at the end of 2011-12 because it was not used in the day-to-day management of prisons and NOMS had concerns over the burden on the frontline of collecting the data.

From 1997-98 to 2010-11, local authority total income from sales, fees and charges in England from parking rose from £608 million to £1.25 billion; net profits from parking rose from £223 million to £512 million in the same period.

However, some councils are raising money illegally from parking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Last July, the High Court ruled that one London borough had illegally hiked parking charges to raise general revenue. The BBC television programme, <em>Inside Out</em>, also drew to my attention parking contracts signed by local authorities where outsourced parking wardens are rewarded for issuing more fines – in flagrant breach of the Government's operational guidance to councils.

Labour DCLG Ministers called for councils to charge for more services, including parking, bemoaned that: ‘Only one in five councils are using charging to the full potential... [such as for] reducing congestion' (<em>Speech to the Local Government Association</em>, 2 July 2008).

Reserve generation displaces the output of existing generating stations to maintain the balance of supply and demand, so there is no net increase of power on the system at any one time; therefore the only additional emissions from reserve associated with wind power is through the inefficiency of running separate generating stations at part load rather than fewer stations at full-load, which is relatively insignificant compared to the carbon savings made.</p><p><em><strong>[1]</strong></em><em>Coal and Gas emissions factors from table DUKES 5C, available at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electricity-chapter-5-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electricity-chapter-5-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes</a></em></p><p> </p>","Bexhill and Battle","Gregory Barker",,"2014-07-03T15:19:33.3060218Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63880/answer","Biography information for Lord Barker of Battle","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63880/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63880/answer",,,,,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2014-06-25","Carbon Emissions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, with reference to the Answer for 4 March 2014, Official Report, column 765W, on carbon emissions, to which other technologies that Answer refers to; and whether this would still be the case if the carbon footprint of backup technologies was factored in.","false","Biography information for Mr Stephen O'Brien","Eddisbury","Mr Stephen O'Brien","202392"

The Government recognises that some tenant groups and campaigners support this option, which might appear to offer a simple way of ensuring that tied tenants are no worse off than free-of-tie tenants. We looked carefully at this measure but have decided not to introduce it.</p><p>The responses to the Government's consultation on a Statutory Code and Adjudicator for the pubs sector raised concerns that mandatory free-of-tie would create uncertainty for pub-owning companies and have an unpredictable impact on the wider pubs sector which could even undermine the tied model. Even among the polarised views in the industry, there is strong support for the tie as a business model. What is important to the Government is that there are protections in place so that the tied model operates fairly.
