We have made substantial reforms to strengthen the SEND system in recent years, to improve the identification and meeting of the needs of children and young people and to improve families’ experiences of the system. As part of this, the Children and Families Act (2014) secured the general presumption in law of mainstream education in relation to decisions about where children and young people with SEND should be educated, complementing the protections in the Equality Act (2010) against disability discrimination.</p><p> </p><p>Recent steps we have taken to help disabled children and young people reach their full potential in mainstream education include the fact that we have been closely monitoring the pressures on high needs budgets and have provided additional high needs funding for local authorities, alongside their 2019-20 Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocations: a further £125 million in 2018-19 and £125 million of high needs funding for 2019-20.</p><p> </p><p>We are investing £365 million in the Special Provision Capital Fund from 2018 to 2021, helping local authorities create new school places and improve existing facilities for children and young people with SEND. This capital funding is not ring-fenced and local authorities can use it as they see fit to improve special provision in their local areas. The funding can be invested in a range of settings, including mainstream and special schools or academies. We have required local authorities to publish their plans on how they use this funding, and these show that many local authorities intend to expand their specialist provision in mainstream schools.</p><p> </p><p>We recognise the importance of staff in mainstream schools having the skills to identify and meet the needs of pupils with SEND. This is why, for example, we have awarded a 2 year, £3.4 million contract to the Whole School SEND Consortium, led by Nasen, to deliver a programme of work to drive education institutions to prioritise SEND and equip schools to identify and meet the relevant training needs of their workforce. We have also funded the Autism Education Trust since 2011 to deliver autism awareness training to education staff in early years, schools and further education settings. This training has so far reached more than 195,000 people - not just teachers and teaching assistants, but also support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism. We are also reviewing the current SEND content in the Initial Teacher Training provision (ITT) and building on our existing SEND specialist qualifications to develop a continuum of learning from ITT, through teachers’ early careers and into specialist and leadership roles in support of the upcoming Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy.</p><p> </p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2019-02-05T18:06:08.733Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050614/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050614/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050614/answer",,,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-01-29","Special Educational Needs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, what recent steps the Government has taken to support the (a) inclusive education of disabled children and young people and (b) progressive removal of barriers to education and participation in mainstream education.","true","Biography information for James Frith","Bury North","James Frith","214131"

The SEN system rightly places considerable weight on the views of parents as to where a child with complex needs should be educated.

This includes offences of common assault, actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm. There are also specific offences of child cruelty and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm, both of which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.</p>",,"Baroness Williams of Trafford","HL13206","2019-02-12T16:21:17.463Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050782/answer","Biography information for Baroness Williams of Trafford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050782/answer","Working_Together_to_Safeguard_Children_2018.pdf ; Keeping_Children_Safe_in_Education__3_September_2018_14.09.18.pdf","Working_Together_to_Safeguard_Children_2018.pdf ; Keeping_Children_Safe_in_Education__3_September_2018_14.09.18.pdf","Working Together to Safeguard Children  ; Keeping Children Safe in Education ","Working Together to Safeguard Children  ; Keeping Children Safe in Education ","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050782/answer",,,,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-01-29","Breast Ironing","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what consideration they have given to introducing legislation to ban the practice of breast ironing.","false","Biography information for Lord Carlile of Berriew",,"Lord Carlile of Berriew","HL13207"

This perceived issue arises where a landlord charges rent weekly on a Monday and, because of the way the calendar falls every 5 or 6 years, seeks 53 rent payments in a year, with the 53rd payment in part covering the tenancy for the first few days of the following year.</p><p>Universal Credit is paid on a monthly cycle. Where a tenant has a weekly rental liability, they will have to make either 4 or 5 rent payments in any one month. This means that claimants are ‘overpaid’ by UC in months where they have to make four rental payments and ‘underpaid’ where they make five. But over time this broadly balances itself out. It is impossible to accurately align weekly and monthly payment cycles at all points in time.</p><p> </p><p>Where a tenant makes a 53rd weekly rent payment on the last Monday of the 2019/20 year, only two days of that payment relates to a liability falling within that year (ie payment covering Monday and Tuesday of that week as Wednesday falls in the new year). Thus, five days of that payment is an advance payment for the following month and that month has only four Mondays and hence four rent payments. The combination of the advance rent payment and the ‘overpayment’ in April 2020 means that the shortfall is immediately recovered.</p><p> </p><p>There is a separate issue with respect to the way the calculation in the Universal Credit regulations converts a weekly liability into a monthly allowance. The conversion is achieved by multiplying the weekly rent by 52 and then dividing by 12. This effectively means one day’s rent a year (two days in a leap years) are not covered by UC. We are currently considering whether this formulation around weekly rents, and potentially other weekly amounts in the UC calculation, should be amended.</p>",,"Baroness Buscombe",,"2019-02-12T17:56:53.297Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050799/answer","Biography information for Baroness Buscombe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050799/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1050799/answer",,,,,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2019-01-29","Universal Credit: Housing","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to acknowledge and take account of 53 week rent years for recipients of Universal Credit.","false","Biography information for Lord Kennedy of Southwark",,"Lord Kennedy of Southwark","HL13222"
