Around 15 million employees would be covered by such an NLW, and labour costs would be around £150 billion higher in 2020 compared to a counterfactual of forecast average earnings growth (in nominal terms) due to the direct effects of the NLW.

We have pledged over £2.3 billion for the UN-led response in Syria and the region, our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis. To date, we have allocated £561 million of this to support vulnerable people inside Syria. By the end of May 2016, UK support inside Syria had provided over 16.3 million food rations, each of which feeds one person for one month; access to clean water for 2 million people (peak month); 3.5 million medical consultations; and more than 5.1 million relief packages.</p><p>Alongside our work to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, DFID works closely with the FCO to push for the protection of civilians within Syria. The protection of civilians was also at the heart of the “Supporting Syria &amp; the Region London 2016” Conference, which the Prime Minister co-hosted in London in February. Participants agreed to use their influence with all parties to the conflict to halt abuses, to allow humanitarian agencies rapid, safe and unimpeded access throughout Syria in order to reach besieged and hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>The UK will consider any option compliant with international law that might save lives in Syria. However, any party seeking to establish a safe area would need to ensure sufficient military capability to guarantee safety from both aerial and ground attack, including by unconventional means. The UK position on military intervention within Syria is well known. In addition, in the current circumstances, the presence of foreign troops at such camps is likely to risk making them a target for some of the parties to the conflict.</p>","New Forest West","Sir Desmond Swayne",,"2016-07-12T16:18:32.527Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532900/answer","Biography information for Sir Desmond Swayne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532900/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532900/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-07-05","Refugees: Syria","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, if the Government will take steps to protect refugee camps in Syria.","false","Biography information for Andrew Rosindell","Romford","Andrew Rosindell","41899"

We are a core member of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), which demanded in May that the Asad regime allow land access to all besieged areas from 1 June, or the international community would call on the World Food Programme (WFP) to carry out humanitarian airdrops to those areas. This was only necessary because the regime has consistently failed to live up to its commitments under International Humanitarian Law to ensure free, unimpeded access for humanitarian agencies.</p><p>As a result, June saw improved levels of humanitarian access. Eight besieged locations were reached by road, including Darayya which received its first deliveries of food since 2012. However, seven remained unreached at the end of June. The regime has now agreed in principle road access to all 16 besieged areas requested by the UN in July. The ISSG is working with the UN to hold the regime to this commitment.</p><p>While delivering aid by road is the best approach to safely deliver the quantities needed and to ensure that it gets to those who need it most, if there is no improvement we must look to the WFP to carry out its plan for airdrops to reach those in need. The ISSG is united in its resolve to ensure full, sustained humanitarian access to the people of Syria.</p>","New Forest West","Sir Desmond Swayne",,"2016-07-11T16:30:45.277Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532980/answer","Biography information for Sir Desmond Swayne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532980/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532980/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-07-05","Syria: Overseas Aid","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, what steps the Government is taking to commence aid drops in Syria.","false","Biography information for Dr Paul Monaghan","Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross","Dr Paul Monaghan","41931"

We are working with local authorities and the childcare sector and providing the support that providers will need to offer the extended entitlement from September 2017.</p><p> </p><p>The Department recently completed the most comprehensive analysis of the childcare market to understand the funding that providers will need to deliver the extended entitlement. The review of childcare costs was published in November 2015 and can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479659/151124_Analytical_review_FINAL_VERSION.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479659/151124_Analytical_review_FINAL_VERSION.pdf</a>. The review informed the increase in the funding rate to providers that was announced in November’s Spending Review.</p><p> </p><p>We will be investing an extra £1 billion per year in the free early years entitlements by 2019/20, including £300 million per year to increase the national average funding rate. This is a generous deal for providers and funds them adequately for delivering the entitlement.</p><p> </p><p>The childcare sector has shown its ability to meet increased demand; Laing and Buisson’s 2014 nursery market report estimated that the UK children’s day care market is now almost one third larger than it was a decade ago. To support continued growth, the Department is investing at least £50 million of capital funding to create additional early years places, and we are removing unnecessary red tape to enable providers to seek investment to expand their businesses.</p><p> </p><p>The recently launched capital grants fund will support the delivery of the 30 hours extended entitlement coming into effect from September 2017. Funding of around £40 million is being made available to early years settings, including schools, through a local authority bidding process. Cumbria County Council submitted an EOI in relation to the early years capital funding and providers in Copeland are therefore eligible to apply to the current funding process. We will expect local authorities to work in close partnership with providers when submitting their bids to ensure that the projects submitted have a clear need for capital funding and are able to fully evidence how they will address the sufficiency need identified in the local authority area.</p>","East Surrey","Mr Sam Gyimah",,"2016-07-07T15:52:52.773Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532448/answer","Biography information for Mr Sam Gyimah","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532448/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/532448/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-07-04","Children: Day Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment her Department has made of the ability of childcare providers in (a) England and (b) Copeland constituency to provide the additional hours necessary to extend free childcare for three and four year olds.","false","Biography information for Mr Jamie Reed","Copeland","Mr Jamie Reed","41693"

However, an estimate of the cost to the public purse in lost revenue from introducing an exemption from prescription charges for all people with long-term medical conditions was made as part of the review of prescription charges by Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, which was commissioned by a previous Government and published in 2010.</p><p> </p><p>Professor Gilmore’s estimate for extending the prescription charge exemption to everyone with a long-term condition was at a cost of £360 to £430 million a year. This is likely to be an underestimate, given the increases in the prescription charge and increasing numbers of prescriptions dispensed since the Review was published. Overall, prescription charge revenue for 2014/15, which is the last year for which we have a complete audited figure, was £503.9 million derived from dispensing in the community. This is vital revenue for the National Health Service.</p><p> </p><p>A number of prescription charge exemptions are in place, for which someone with a long-term condition may qualify. These include exemptions based on low income, such as certain out of work benefits and the NHS Low Income Scheme, and age. Where someone does not qualify for exemption, Prescription Prepayment Certificates are available.
