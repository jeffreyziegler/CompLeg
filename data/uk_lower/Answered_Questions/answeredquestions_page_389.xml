Other sectors of opportunity include: defence, urban regeneration &amp; construction, airports, rail, ICT &amp; software, food &amp; beverage. The changing dynamics in the world economy have reduced demand for UK oil &amp; gas expertise but we are continuing to explore opportunities in renewable energy.</p><p>We are also using the GREAT Campaign to provide platforms for UK firms to network through business events around Rugby World Cup, Bond, the Clipper Yacht Race, Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in Melbourne and a broader Culture is GREAT campaign in Victoria. Trade missions from London, Northern Ireland and a sports infrastructure themed mission organised by Major Events International have all visited Australia in 2015. We are also supporting the launching of EU-Australia Free Trade Agreement talks and we maintain a strong flow of ministerial and high-level official contacts in support of the bilateral relationship including on trade and investment.</p><p>In New Zealand particularly good opportunities continue for UK firms in transport infrastructure, defence,construction, airports, rail, and food &amp; beverage.

These include: energy, infrastructure, transport, financial services, creative industries and defence and security. Activities in the past three months to deliver this include: a Northern Ireland Minister led trade mission to Montreal &amp; Toronto; securing business for UK film producers at the Toronto International Film Festival; deliver a 12 day programme of GREAT activity in Toronto and supporting low carbon technology at the opening of Shell’s Carbon Capture and Storage facility in Alberta.</p><p><br> In 2016 we will promote the Canada EU comprehensive economic and trade agreement which will deliver substantial benefit for UK business.

The Department does not publish data on the number of additional primary places needed to meet demand at planning area level.</p><p>The Department does not currently publish basic need scorecards for secondary school places.</p><br /><p>Between 2003/4 and 2009/10 the total number of school places in the system reduced by 200,000, against a backdrop of rising birth rates. That is why the Coalition Government doubled the funding available to create new school places during the last Parliament to £5 billion, and this Government has committed to invest a further £7 billion during this Parliament. The latest published information shows there were 445,000 more school places in May 2014 than in May 2010, and we know that many more places have been delivered since then or are in the pipeline.</p><br /><p>Over this Parliament, we have committed to open at least 500 new free schools.</p><br /><p>[1] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-capacity-academic-year-2013-to-2014" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-capacity-academic-year-2013-to-2014</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/primary-school-places-local-authority-basic-need-scorecards-2014" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/primary-school-places-local-authority-basic-need-scorecards-2014</a></p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson","15418","2015-11-19T15:48:09.113Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427103/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427103/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427103/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2015-11-09","Primary Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, how many planning areas in England are in need of additional primary school places by September 2016; in how many of those planning areas there has never been an application to open a primary or all-through mainstream free school; and in how of those planning areas there are no primary or all-through mainstream free schools.","false","Biography information for Jess Phillips","Birmingham, Yardley","Jess Phillips","15419"

Member is referring to cancer communications.</p><br /><p>Public Health England (PHE) runs a number of Be Clear on Cancer (BCoC) campaigns to encourage symptom recognition and earlier general practitioner (GP) presentation. The campaigns have been running since early 2011 and have covered a number of cancers nationally and regionally. Incidence increases with age for most cancers and BCoC targets men and women over 50, especially those from lower socioeconomic groups, as there is evidence that these individuals are more likely to delay seeing their GP. Although BCoC campaigns target people over 50, they do reach a much wider age group because of national media campaign activity.</p><br /><p>Specialist organisations are consulted on campaign development to ensure that communications are accessible and inclusive. These have included Mencap, the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities, and EasyHealth, specifically targeting people with learning disabilities and using their networks to share information effectively. In addition, campaign materials are produced in alternative formats, including easy read. Disability and carer organisations are sent tailored briefing sheets and toolkits to ensure their members are aware of campaign messages and the availability of alternative formats. Following each campaign, PHE seeks feedback from the disability and carer organisations it has worked with to evaluate the success of the engagement and ensure improvements are made where possible.</p><br /><p>Locally, there are also a number of good examples where the National Health Service is tailoring its communications to ensure they are accessible to all groups, including those with learning disabilities. NHS England is exploring how these can be taken forward and built on at a national level. For example, easy read versions of cancer screening leaflets are available for people with learning disabilities.</p><br /><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2015-11-19T17:39:12.083Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427187/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427187/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427187/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-11-09","Cancer","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he is taking to ensure that cancer communities are targeted towards all age groups and people with learning disabilities.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","15490"

Because of this, the way the NHS delivers health and care in 25 years’ time may look very different from the way health and care is delivered today.</p><br /><p>The NHS will take advantage of science and technology to deliver healthcare in different ways, in care settings appropriate to people’s needs. This will include hospitals but also new primary and community settings and in people’s homes, where that suits patients and their families. The NHS will of course also need to change the way healthcare is delivered as people live longer lives, with longer term, more complex, multiple health issues. Many of these needs will be best met by supporting people to live healthier as well as longer lives, in their own homes and communities, rather than admitting them to a hospital. The Government has set a priority to transform out-of-hospital care in every community.</p><br /><p>The NHS Five Year Forward View sets out how the NHS will need to develop to deliver care in new and innovative ways. Different local health communities are being supported as part of the New Care Models Vanguard programme to develop a small number of new care delivery options and models. It is likely that the concept of distinctive health settings, such as within the hospital sector, or within community or primary care, will become less important, as healthcare is delivered in closer partnership with people and coordinated around their needs.</p><br /><p>Allowing successful innovations to be spread throughout the NHS is integral to the design of the healthcare delivery models the Vanguard programme is developing.

Member’s tenure as a Minister, included a profile of how the hours worked by doctors in training were spread across the week.</p><p>We have evidence that hospital leaders consider the junior doctors’ contract to be a significant barrier to delivering more seven-day services. NHS Providers’ written evidence to the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration on contract reform for consultants and doctors and dentists in training<sup>2</sup> stated that the junior doctor contract is still a significant source of barriers to seven day working and reform of the junior doctor contract is also required to support trusts to deliver more seven-day services. In particular, the pay banding system for junior doctors needs to be reviewed. There were concerns from employers that the banding system is too complicated, can create “perverse incentives” for junior doctors and hospital management, and means that providing more seven-day services is unfeasible, since more junior doctors would be working outside core hours and receive premiums under the current banding system.

It therefore does not take account of gains in working-life income through earnings (or working-age benefits) received in the period up to the new State Pension age that will either wholly or partially replace the income a person would have received from their private and / or State Pensions.</p><br /><p>The Pensions Act 2011 Impact Assessment, published in November 2011, is available at:</p><br /><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181462/pensions-bill-2011-ia-annexa.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181462/pensions-bill-2011-ia-annexa.pdf</a></p>","North Swindon","Justin Tomlinson",,"2015-11-19T13:27:32.323Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427308/answer","Biography information for Justin Tomlinson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427308/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427308/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2015-11-09","State Retirement Pensions: Females","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the average amount foregone by women who will wait longer to receive their state pension was as a result of changes brought about by the Pension Act 2011.","false","Biography information for Gavin Newlands","Paisley and Renfrewshire North","Gavin Newlands","15477"

We evaluate the campaign to ensure it is effective, that we continually improve performance; and that we ultimately deliver value for money for the taxpayer.</p><br /><p>Prior to each campaign we set communication objectives and key performance indicators. We measure progress against these by running surveys with our target audience before and immediately after the campaign. We have seen positive shifts in key performance indicators for the majority of our campaigns. All of our recent campaign evaluation reports are published on gov.uk<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>.</p><br /><p>In the long run, positive changes in key performance indicators on campaigns such as speeding, drink driving and seatbelts have correlated with fewer drivers exceeding the speed limit, fewer accidents involving drink driving and higher seatbelt wearing rates; and ultimately to fewer road casualties.</p><br /><p>Publicity campaigns are part of the solution to reduce road casualties and work best when used alongside enforcement and engineering interventions. Due to the multiple factors affecting casualties (weather, road conditions, traffic levels, the economy etc.) it is difficult to demonstrate a causal relationship with a specific intervention. However, in 2012 the department commissioned an independent agency to evaluate the impact drink drive campaigns have had on casualties. They used econometric modelling to estimate that over a 30 year period, drink drive communication campaigns have saved almost 2,000 lives and prevented over 10,000 serious injuries<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>.</p><br /><p>In 2013, the Transport Research Laboratory published<sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup> a review and synthesis of evidence on the effectiveness of pre-driver education and training for those under 17 years of age which was undertaken for the Coalition Government.
