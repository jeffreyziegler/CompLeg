The Taskforce is investing in a nationwide fraud prevention campaign ‘Take 5’, funded by the financial sector and Government, so that individuals know how to act when faced by a fraudster to avoid being scammed. The Taskforce is also developing a funds repatriation scheme, so that stolen money can be tracked across the payment network, frozen, then repatriated back to the victim of the crime also stopping the money from getting into the hands of the criminal.</p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has the objective of protecting and enhancing the integrity of the UK financial system.

These systems and controls should enable the firm to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk. A firm’s systems and controls must be comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its activities. Where a firm’s systems and controls are not adequate, the FCA can and does take enforcement action.
