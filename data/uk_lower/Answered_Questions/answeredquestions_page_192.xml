It should be noted that one report can contain multiple reactions.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Contrast Agent</p></td><td><p>Number of Reports</p></td><td><p>Number of Reactions</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadodiamide</p></td><td><p>59</p></td><td><p>119</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadoversetamide</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadopentetic Acid</p></td><td><p>160</p></td><td><p>401</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadobenic Acid</p></td><td><p>98</p></td><td><p>267</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadoxetic Acid</p></td><td><p>34</p></td><td><p>73</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadoteridol</p></td><td><p>272</p></td><td><p>628</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadobutrol</p></td><td><p>352</p></td><td><p>1,013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadoteric acid</p></td><td><p>344</p></td><td><p>881</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gadolinium (not otherwise specified)</p></td><td><p>27</p></td><td><p>111</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>Yellow Card data cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the frequency of suspected ADRs to medicines. The level of ADR reporting may fluctuate between given years due to a variety of reasons such as a medicine being new (reporting rates are generally higher when a product is first introduced), stimulated interest/publicity and variations in exposure to the medicine. The data should be seen in the context of the many millions of people who have received gadolinium containing contrast agents.</p><p> </p><p>It is also important to note that Yellow Card reports are not proof of a side effect occurring but only a suspicion by the reporter that the medicine may have caused the symptoms. Yellow Card reports may therefore relate to true side effects of the medicine, or they may be due to coincidental illnesses that would have occurred in the absence of medicine.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine",,"2018-01-08T16:39:12.717Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810237/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810237/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810237/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-12-20","Gadolinium: Health Hazards","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what reports he has received on the number of people who have been adversely affected by Gadolinium.","false","Biography information for Jonathan Ashworth","Leicester South","Jonathan Ashworth","120703"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810243","Ministry of Defence","false","2018-01-12","<p>The Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) describes two Reserve Forces: Volunteer Reserves and Regular Reserves. It also makes provision for “special members”, commonly known as Sponsored Reserves, where employers enter into capability contracts with the Ministry of Defence, providing for some or all of their employees to be mobilised when the operational need arises.</p><p> </p><p>Volunteer Reserves accept an annual training commitment and a liability for call-out for permanent service. All serve on Reserve Service Days (RSDs). Pay is attendance-based. Annual training is comprised of continuous training (which is a unit camp or an attachment or course involving one or more periods not exceeding 16 days per annum) and non-continuous training (which can take place at any time, but normally at weekends and training nights). Each Service mandates the number of RSDs required under obligatory training to achieve a Certificate of Efficiency and therefore qualify for a training bounty.</p><p> </p><p>Section 27 of RFA 96 enables Reservists to undertake Voluntary Training or Other Duties (VTOD). Volunteer Reservists can also agree to maintain a higher level of readiness (the High Readiness Reserve) for which they are paid a premium to their annual bounty. They can also agree to enter into a formal commitment to undertake Defence work either as an Additional Duties Commitment (ADC) or on Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS).</p><p> </p><p>An ADC is a formal binding commitment under Section 25 of RFA 96, under which a Reservist commits to perform specified duties for a specified period or periods ranging between 16 days and a maximum of 180 days in any 12 month period. ADC may include duties outside the UK and service alongside any of the Regular Services. Pay is attendance-based.</p><p> </p><p>Section 24 of RFA96 provides for Reservists to undertake periods of FTRS, performing specified duties for a specified period with a continuous liability for duty. There are three types of FTRS commitment, each with a different liability, and the type of commitment offered to the reservist is determined by the liability required. These are:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Full Commitment</strong><strong> (FC)</strong>: an individual on FTRS (FC) is fully deployable without the need to be mobilised.</p><p><strong>Limited Commitment</strong>: these Reservists fulfil a full range of duties based in one location (which may be overseas) and have a liability for compulsory detachment in the UK or overseas which is limited to a total of 35 days in any one year, with no single detachment lasting in excess of 21 days. If detached to a theatre of operations they must first be mobilised.</p><p><strong>Home Commitment</strong>: these Reservists fulfil a full range of duties appropriate to the post in a single, restricted location but with a liability for compulsory detachment limited to training periods and other limited duties specified in the individual’s FTRS commitment. Detachment does not extend to travel to a theatre of operations unless mobilised.</p><p> </p><p>FTRS is a fixed term commitment, and can be short-term or long-term. Conditions of Service for each type of commitment are detailed in single Service regulations. A Reservist will normally be given, or be required to give, three to six months’ notice of termination if they wish to end the commitment early but a commitment can be terminated at any time by mutual consent. The Service can terminate an FTRS commitment at any time. There is no redundancy policy. The basic pay (i.e. without X-factor) of a Reservist on FTRS is the same as that of a Regular, with X-factor set at either 0, 5, or 14.5% depending upon the commitment.</p><p> </p><p>Special members of the Reserve Forces, commonly known as Sponsored Reserves, differ from other members of the military as they are employed at all times through the contractor and only receive relevant military training to allow them to survive, operate and perform their contracted task as military personnel in an operational environment. This varies depending on the environments in which they are contracted to operate. Section 40 of RFA 96 sets out the liability of Sponsored Reserves to be called out or to train. Pay and conditions of service for Sponsored Reserves are determined by their contract of employment with their employer.</p><p> </p><p>The Regular Reserve Force comprises the Royal Fleet Reserve, Army Regular Reserve and Royal Air Force Regular Reserve. Members of this Reserve Force are all former Regular members of the Armed Forces. Many retain a liability to be called out for service, the duration of which is determined by their previous contract type, length of Regular service and reason for leaving. Some are available to provide specialist capability for a limited time after leaving Regular service; all form a strategic reserve for resilience and regeneration of our Armed Forces in case of national crisis. In general, ex-Regular Reservists have only been called upon to support routine operations if they have volunteered or when volunteer reservists have not been available.</p><p> </p>","Bournemouth East","Mr Tobias Ellwood",,"2018-01-12T14:59:03.657Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810243/answer","Biography information for Mr Tobias Ellwood","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810243/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810243/answer",,,,,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2017-12-20","Reserve Forces: Contracts","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how many different types of contracts there are for the Reserve Forces; and what the difference between those contacts is.","false","Biography information for Mrs Madeleine Moon","Bridgend","Mrs Madeleine Moon","120709"

For example, Healthy Start vitamin vouchers are offered for free to Healthy Start beneficiaries. Vitamin tablets are available to pregnant women and women with a child under one year old, and children’s vitamin drops are available for those between six months and four years old.</p><p> </p><p>Some 1.1 million children get free school meals, and the Government is investing £26 million in breakfast clubs. The School Fruit and Vegetables scheme provides 2.3 million children with a portion of fresh fruit or vegetables each day at school. This contributes towards the recommended five portions a day and helps encourage healthier eating for life. The nursery milk scheme also provides a free daily portion of milk to 1.5 million children and babies.</p><p> </p><p>Important guidance has been published on tackling malnutrition. For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2012 quality standard 'Nutrition support in adults’ provides advice to the National Health Service to help identify patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. NHS England published guidance in 2015 on improving the delivery and commissioning of nutrition and hydration care in acute services and the community.</p><p> </p><p>The Government have provided £500,000 to the charity Age UK’s Malnutrition Taskforce to reduce malnutrition among older people and we will continue to train all health staff so early action can be taken. The Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 requires care homes to make sure that people have enough to eat and drink to meet their nutrition and hydration needs and receive the support they require to do so. The Care Quality Commission can prosecute breaches.</p><p> </p><p>Government advice on a healthy, balanced diet is encapsulated in the Eatwell Guide.

The guidelines were published to ensure a consistent approach to these offences is taken by courts in England and Wales. Requests for further guidance were received by the Sentencing Council from the National Fly Tipping Prevention Group, chaired by Defra, and the Environment Agency. This was due to concerns that the fines were not high enough to reflect the seriousness of the offences committed or to have a deterrent effect, and that there was an inconsistency in fine levels across the country.</p><p> </p><p>The guidelines encourage magistrates to make more use of the highest levels of fines for some of the more serious offences that come before the courts. It also helps sentencers more easily pitch a fine that is proportionate to the means of the offender.</p><p> </p><p>The Sentencing Council reviewed the effectiveness of the guidelines in 2016. The assessment showed that the level of fines for organisations has risen, but fines for individuals have not seen the same increase. Fines are the most common sentences passed for these offences, since the offences are motivated by making a profit or saving money. However, custody remains the starting point for the most serious types of individual offenders who deliberately commit a crime that causes significant or major harm.</p><p> </p><p>The penalties for fly-tipping are on summary conviction: imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or a fine or both; and on conviction on Indictment: imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or a fine or both. The removal in 2015 of the £5,000 cap for maximum fines that magistrate’s courts can impose, means that magistrates can hand down an unlimited fine for a fly-tipping summary offences.</p><p> </p><p>In May 2016 we introduced fixed penalty notices of up to £400 for small-scale fly-tipping.

These factors include but are not limited to long-term demographic changes. For example, in its Fiscal Sustainability Analytical Paper on Public Spending on Health (2016), the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) found that health spending is driven by a multitude of factors, broadly grouped under demographic factors, changes in income and other cost pressures. Using a range of evidence to inform their analysis, the report found that historically, spending in healthcare has been driven, amongst other factors, by changes in the population size and structure, changing morbidity, technological and medical advances as well as an overall increase in national income. In respect of income, the OBR highlights that, as a “normal good”, people tend to demand more healthcare as their incomes rise. These drivers are commonly cited in the literature, including by international institutions such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund.

McKinsey estimates that bridging the gender gap in work would add £150 billion to the UK economy by 2025. We need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential.</p><p> </p><p>The full-time gender pay gap has fallen to a record low of 9.1%, and we are committed to eliminating the gender pay gap entirely. In 2017 we introduced requirements for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus gaps data by April 2018. These requirements will help employers identify and take action to close their gender pay gaps, which is key to accelerating progress.</p><p> </p><p>Many women struggle to find good jobs that meet their needs after taking time out to care for children and other relatives. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that time out of the labour market has a substantial impact on women’s salaries. On returning to work, women earn around 2% less on average for every year spent out of paid work. In the 2017 budget, £5 million in funding was allocated to increasing opportunities and support for returners. We are working with employers across the public and private sector to understand how returners can be supported back into permanent employment, and co-ordinating new public sector programmes for returners across the country in a wide variety of roles.</p><p> </p><p>The Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities recently launched the government’s ‘Unlocking Talent, Fulfilling Potential’ plan to improve social mobility through education. GEO will be engaging with the wider Department for Education on the implementation of the plan.</p>","Scarborough and Whitby","Mr Robert Goodwill",,"2017-12-22T18:51:16.823Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/809836/answer","Biography information for Mr Robert Goodwill","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/809836/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/809836/answer",,,,,,,,"31","Women and Equalities","Women and Equalities","2017-12-19","Government Equalities Office: Social Mobility","1","House of Commons","To ask the Minister for Women and Equalities, what steps the Government Equalities Office has taken to improve social mobility in each of the last seven years.","false","Biography information for Chris Ruane","Vale of Clwyd","Chris Ruane","120456"
