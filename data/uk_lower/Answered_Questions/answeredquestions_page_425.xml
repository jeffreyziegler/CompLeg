The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for CEPP is the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff for Military Capability, who is directly accountable to the Permanent Under Secretary for Defence for the coherent delivery of the overall CEPP capability. The principal skill set required by the SRO is leadership and experience in delivering complex programmes across Defence. Specialist experience of carrier air operations is provided by the individual SROs for the carrier and F35B projects (Royal Navy and RAF respectively), both of whom have significant experience of carrier air operations. The CEPP SRO is also directly supported by a programme director, a Rear Admiral with extensive experience in the Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) programme, as well as frigate and air station command, an Air Commodore (Head of CEPP), and a small joint staff with significant maritime, combat air and command experience.</p><p> </p><p>The Head of CEPP is an experienced Air Commodore having served extensively within the joint arena delivering capability. While he has not served at sea in aircraft carriers, his portfolio does not require this. He is responsible for ensuring coherent delivery across the CEPP programme rather than an individual project remit.</p><p> </p><p>The QEC SRO is a Rear Admiral. He has blended his extensive aviation experience with considerable time at sea. He has served at sea extensively in frigates, air defence destroyers, Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and commanded the Royal Navy's largest warship; the helicopter carrier HMS OCEAN. He has also commanded the patrol vessel HMS ANGLESEY conducting fishery protection and the Type 23 frigate HMS SOMERSET. Other maritime commands include the Iraqi maritime Task Group during Operation TELIC and Chief of Staff appointments for two counter piracy missions: operation ATALANTA and CTF 151, which included a deployment in the US Navy Ticonderoga class destroyer USS ANZIO. He spent over two years working for Flag Officer Sea Training as the lead Commander for Warfare and Command. He has recently completed an 18 month appointment as the United Kingdom Maritime Component Commander and Deputy Commander Combined Maritime Forces, based within the USNAVCENT Headquarters in Bahrain. The period spanned operation LUMINOUS from Cyprus, the completion of operation HERRICK and the commencement of operation SHADER in Iraq.</p><p> </p><p>The SRO for the F-35B is an Air Commodore. He is a highly experienced former Harrier pilot whose embarked experience with 3(F) Sqn flying the Harrier GR7 from HMS ILLUSTRIOUS saw him both day and night deck qualified. He also acted as a Landing Signals Officer, responsible for providing critical safety information to both the pilot in the cockpit and the command team during aircraft recovery. This qualification required him to be not only a skilled aviator, but also knowledgeable about broader ship operations. He achieved a total of three months of embarked flying, which was followed by two and a half years as a Joint Harrier Squadron Commander.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",,"Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348429/answer",,,,,,"2015-06-12T13:04:57.76Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348429/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348429/answer",,,,,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2015-06-03","Aircraft Carriers","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the Written Answer by Lord Astor of Hever on 23 March (HL5737), how many years at sea in aircraft carriers the Head of Carrier Enabled Power Projection has served; and how many years at sea, in aircraft-carrying warships, the Senior Responsible Owners for the Carrier and F35B projects have served.","false","Biography information for Lord West of Spithead",,"Lord West of Spithead","HL241"

The latest data shows that over 96% of pregnant women in England received their full health and risk assessment before 12 weeks and 6 days between April and June 2014. Early access to maternity services helps tackle the negative impact of health inequalities from the start of life and supports good health and well-being in mother and baby.</p><p> </p><p>Women with complex social factors do not always access maternity services early, or attend regularly for antenatal care and poorer outcomes are consequently reported for mother and baby. Maternity services need to be proactive in engaging all women. To support National Health Service maternity services engagement with pregnant women with complex social factors, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published clinical guidelines on pregnancy and complex social factors, which describes how access to care can be improved and contact with antenatal care maintained.</p><p> </p><p>Maternity services feature prominently in the key objectives set out in the Mandate between the Government and NHS England. All women, regardless of their wealth or immigration status, should have a named midwife responsible for ensuring she receives personalised care throughout pregnancy, childbirth and during the postnatal period.

Yellow Card data cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the frequency of suspected ADRs to vaccines or medicines.

The most recent PHE-backed review was undertaken by its own independent expert Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) and published at the end of April 2012. The AGNIR report considered whether there was evidence for health effects occurring in relation to exposures below the ICNIRP levels. The overall conclusion was that, “although a substantial amount of research has been conducted in this area, there is no convincing evidence that radio wave exposures below guideline levels cause health effects in either adults or children.” PHE constantly reviews emerging research for any changes to the conclusions of this report.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the Department is supporting a research programme into the use of mobile phones by young people and PHE is participating in international studies on children’s health and radiowaves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348007/answer",,,,,,"2015-06-08T10:55:05.59Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348007/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348007/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-06-02","Radiation: Health Hazards","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if his Department will undertake research into medical conditions in young people arising from radiation emitted by wi-fi units, mobile phones and other wireless devices; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Sir Greg Knight","East Yorkshire","Sir Greg Knight","716"
