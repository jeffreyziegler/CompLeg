It is important that they use equalities legislation, including positive action provisions, to make better progress in terms of recruitment of under-represented groups.</p><p>The Government's reforms have already made improvements, for example we set up the College of Policing which has embarked on a major programme of work, BME Progression 2018, looking at recruitment, retention and progression of black and minority ethnic officers, including the development of an evidence base of successful approaches used by forces.</p><p>As part of this programme the College recently published Positive Action Practical Advice, which advises forces on the use of lawful positive action to support the recruitment, retention and progression of officers from under-represented groups, and it has published case studies from forces showing what can be done.</p><p>The College of Policing is currently undertaking a review of initial police recruitment, including the SEARCH assessment centre for police recruits, to better understand disproportionality that can occur between white candidates and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.

This is significantly more representative than the current make up of the superintendent rank which comprises 17% women and 4% ethnic minority.</p><p>Police Now, introduced in the Metropolitan Police, has appointed 69 people to start their training, up from an anticipated 50 owing to the high calibre of applicants. Of these, 43% are women and 9% are from a BME background, compared to the national BME proportion of 5.5%.</p><p>With the joint leadership of the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime and the Commissioner, the Metropolitan Police also introduced its London residency criteria for recruits in August 2014.

In 2014 PHE published <em>Making it Work</em>, a guide to commissioning for sexual health across the whole system, to improve the sexual health of both individuals and the wider public.</p><br /><p>We have made no formal assessment of the effect on sexual health services of reductions in the Public Health Grant to LAs for 2015/16, although PHE continues to monitor relevant outcomes data for every LA in England. Decisions on local public health spending are a matter for LAs. They are mandated by legislation to commission open access sexual health services that meet the needs of their local population. Officials meet regularly with sexual health organisations who would raise any concerns if LAs were not meeting their mandatory requirements for sexual health services.</p><br /><p>The Framework for Sexual Health Improvement includes as a priority reducing unwanted pregnancies and highlights the need to increase access to long acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods and emergency contraception for women of all ages. We have no plans to evaluate the effect on general practitioner surgeries of LA commissioning of LARCs.</p><br />","Battersea","Jane Ellison","21778 ; 21812 ; 21813 ; 21814","2016-01-14T17:01:32.723Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443693/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443693/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443693/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-01-11","Genito-urinary Medicine","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what system of monitoring is in place to ensure that local authorities meet their duty to commission open access, confidential services for sexually transmitted infections and contraception.","false","Biography information for Emma Reynolds","Wolverhampton North East","Emma Reynolds","21816"

The Government does not plan to move to national electricity distribution charging, as the current cost reflective approach helps to ensure efficient use of the network and keeps overall costs down for bill payers across Great Britain. In contrast, national pricing risks an overall increase in network costs by weakening each network company’s local accountability to its customers, as well as making charges less transparent. On 23 October 2015, Ofgem published a report on the regional differences in network charges, which found no compelling case from a regulatory perspective to move to a national network charge. The report is available at:</p><br /><p><a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/regional-differences-network-charges" target="_blank">https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/regional-differences-network-charges</a>.</p><br /><p>The Government will continue to consider any evidence that is presented.</p><br /><p>Whilst the Government believes that, in general, cost reflective charging represents the right approach, it is right to consider intervention if one region has markedly different charging levels to any other. This forms the rationale for our Hydro Benefit Replacement Scheme, which protects consumers in the North of Scotland from the very high electricity distribution charges that would otherwise occur. The scheme is providing an annual assistance amount of £57m in 2015/16, which equates to £41 per household in the North of Scotland.

The Government is working with the profession to raise the status of teaching and is attracting the brightest and best to a career in the classroom, with the result that record numbers of highly-qualified graduates and experienced career changes are now teaching in schools.</p><p>On retention, latest statistics (School Workforce Census, November 2014) show that teacher retention one year after qualifying has remained stable, at around 90 per cent, for the past two decades. In addition, 72 per cent of those who qualified in 2009 were still in teaching five years later and the long-term retention rate is also stable, with over 60 per cent of teachers remaining in the classroom 10 years after qualifying.</p><p>The Department for Education is continually working to grow a strong pipeline of teachers and has developed a package of measures to support both the recruitment of new trainees (who account for around a half of all new entrants to the state-funded sector each year) and the retention of existing teachers.</p><p>Latest figures show there are a record number of teachers, with a record number coming back to the profession. The Initial Teacher Training census, published in November 2015, shows that three per cent more people started postgraduate teacher training than in the previous year. We recognise, however, that as the economy improves and the labour market strengthens, teacher recruitment is becoming increasingly challenging for some schools – particularly in some areas of the country and in some shortage subjects. That is why we are offering a range of bursaries and scholarships worth up to £30,000 tax-free to trainees in 2016/17. In addition, we are launching the National Teacher Service, as well as expanding the Teach First and School Direct programmes which will mean more great teachers in every corner of the country.</p><p>In terms of the long term recruitment of teachers, we use the Teacher Supply Model (TSM) to estimate Initial Teacher Training place requirements in England each year to meet the state-funded sector demand for qualified teachers. Forecasts are related to a range of factors including year-on-year pupil population growth rates, teacher leaving rates, and curriculum changes.</p><p>The 2016/17 version of the TSM, which was used to inform the 2016/17 ITT recruitment process, along with a user guide explaining the methodology in detail, is available at the following link: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-supply-model" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-supply-model</a></p><br />","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2016-01-19T11:11:02.7Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443973/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443973/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443973/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-01-11","Teachers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what recent assessment she has made of (a) morale in the teaching profession, (b) long-term prospects for teacher recruitment and retention and (c) the potential effect of increases in pupil numbers on (i) morale and (ii) recruitment and retention in that profession.","false","Biography information for Thangam Debbonaire","Bristol West","Thangam Debbonaire","21741"
