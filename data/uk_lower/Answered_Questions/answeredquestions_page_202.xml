This includes £300 million for music education hubs, £58 million in 2016-18 for the Music and Dance Scheme, which allows exceptionally talented children to attend specialist music and dance institutions. £27 million has been provided for Dance and Drama Awards which supports students aged 16-23 to access specialist dance and drama provision at 18 institutions. And £8 million has been offered in 2016-18 for cultural education programmes including Saturday Art and Design Clubs, the National Youth Dance Company and the BFI’s Film Academy programme.</p><p> </p><p>Level 2 and 3 creative skill qualifications are currently provided by a range of 16 to 19-year-old providers and can be included in study programmes. As long as these programmes comply with the guidelines they will attract funding under 16 to 19-year-old funding rules. The government has maintained funding for the Adult Education Budget (AEB), which is supporting adult skills participation with £1.5 billion this year. The principal purpose of the AEB is to engage adults and provide the skills and learning they need to equip them for work, an apprenticeship or further learning. It will enable more tailored programmes of learning to be made available which do not need to include a qualification.</p><p> </p><p>As recommended by the Independent Panel on Technical Education, we have created a framework of 15 occupational routes that encompass all employment-based and college-based training. Amongst these routes will include the new T-level qualifications. The implementation of these routes will be phased and the Creative and Design route will be rolled out in September 2022. Once these routes are fully rolled out there will be over £500 million additional funding for the delivery of all T-levels to 16 to 19-year olds per year.</p><p> </p><p>Employers can now develop new apprenticeships across a range of sectors to meet their skills needs, and can submit proposals for new apprenticeships directly to the Institute for Apprenticeships.

In two of these councils, Doncaster and Slough, the department established an independent trust after children’s social care services were found to be systemically and persistently inadequate.</p><p> </p><p>An evaluation of Doncaster Children’s Services Trust shows it was viewed favourably by its staff and has had a positive affect on culture and practice: the investment in staff, quality assurance and the way that the Trust communicates its work has led to a shift in culture. This has led to improved staff morale, workforce stability and some practice improvements. For example, the use of agency workers and staff turnover has reduced; and staff reported spending more time with children and families. However, it is too early to determine whether these changes will result in sustained improvements for children and families. An evaluation of Slough Children’s Services Trust is in progress.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other alternative operating models are being tested by councils who are not in intervention. For example, ‘Achieving for Children’ (AfC) is a social enterprise company, set up and jointly owned by two councils, Richmond-upon-Thames and Kingston-upon-Thames. It has recently been funded by the Department for Education to expand to three more councils, the first of which is Windsor and Maidenhead, who joined in August 2017. A Department for Education review, published in 2016, into the establishment of AfC suggested that the main benefits of its creation were: better service quality; better staff engagement; higher levels of innovation; better recruitment and retention; and savings from the combining of services across the two local councils and the development of alternative revenue streams.</p><p> </p><p>The department is keen to broaden the developing evidence base on the potential of alternative delivery models to bring better outcomes for local councils.
