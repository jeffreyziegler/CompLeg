There are three categories of training: 1) compulsory 2) essential and 3) desirable. Compulsory training arises out of the s.10 (4) Courts Act 2003 which sets out where induction training must take place. Essential training provides consolidation and continuation training and also “specific issues training”. The latter is where major legislative or procedural changes take place which magistrates are expected to be familiar with and where attendance at training events will be expected. Desirable training is what is provided beyond the compulsory and essential elements and the full training delivery programme is determined locally by each Magistrates Area Training Committee taking in to account local training needs.</p><p> </p><p>Under the Protocol for the National Minimum Training provision for Magistrates, HMCTS must provide the resources for the delivery of all compulsory and essential training identified in each MATC Training Plan. The MATC will prioritise the delivery of desirable training from any additional training funds that may be available.</p><p>Each (MATC) provides a return to the Judicial College on their activities for the year. The returns show that all compulsory and essential training has been completed but it is not possible to extract from the returns the total number of magistrates who attended “desirable” training during 2013/14 in accordance with the Judicial College definition.

Both reports recognised that unless the population of the island increases, it will be a challenge to maintain the longer-term sustainability of Pitcairn. Her Majesty's Government fully supports the economic development of the Pitcairn Islands. The Government of Pitcairn has recently worked up a new Strategic Development Plan and a repopulation plan, and Her Majesty’s Government has given advice on both these documents. The Pitcairn Island Council is currently reconsidering those documents alongside HMG’s advice. We will continue to work in partnership with the Government of Pitcairn to support the community in Pitcairn as we consider longer-term options for the island.

The principal means is by way of a positive recommendation from the independent Parole Board, which falls to officials either to accept or reject on behalf of the Secretary of State, under agreed delegated authority and in accordance with policy agreed by the Secretary of State. However, ISPs may also apply to progress to open conditions without a positive recommendation from the Parole Board being sought, where they can show exceptional progress in reducing their risk. Each application is determined on its merits under agreed delegated authority by officials in the Offender Management and Public Protection Group in the Ministry of Justice.</p><p> </p><p>Determinate sentenced prisoners are assessed for their suitability for open conditions by experienced prison staff with relevant input from offender managers and other professionals within the prison. The assessment will consider the extent to which the prisoner has reduced identified risks and any intelligence or other information that provides evidence of the prisoner’s trustworthiness for conditions of very low security. Determinate sentence prisoners should not generally be moved to open prison if they have more than two years to serve to their earliest release date, unless assessment of a prisoner’s individual risks and needs support earlier categorisation to open conditions. Such cases must have the reasons for their categorisation fully documented and confirmed in writing by the Governing Governor.</p><p> </p><p>All those located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and their risks have been deemed manageable in open conditions.</p><p> </p><p>The public have understandable concerns about the failure of a small minority of prisoners to return from temporary release from open prison. Keeping the public safe is our priority and we will not allow the actions of these offenders to undermine public confidence in the prison system. The number of temporary release failures remains very low; less that one failure in every 1,000 temporary releases and about five in every 100,000 temporary releases involving alleged offending, but we take each and every incident seriously. The Government has already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. Prisoners are now no longer eligible for transfer to open conditions if they have previously absconded from open prisons, or if they have failed to return or reoffended whilst released on temporary licence, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-11-03T14:10:47.607866Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101489/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101489/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101489/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-10-28","Open Prisons","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prisoners are serving custodial sentences in open prisons, broken down by the most serious offence for which they were imprisoned, in the most recent period for which figures are available.","false","Biography information for Sir Graham Brady","Altrincham and Sale West","Mr Graham Brady","212354"

However, this Government has invested £6.5 billion investment to help vulnerable people through housing related support. A proportion of this money will be used by local authorities to commission refuge services. In addition we have made over £500 million available since 2010 to local authorities and the voluntary sector to prevent and tackle homelessness and rough sleeping. This funding will also help the most vulnerable in society, including victims of domestic abuse.</p><p>The dynamics of domestic abuse mean that accommodation can play an important role in the resolution of interpersonal abuse and conflict. This is why the homelessness legislation in England provides one of the strongest safety nets in the world for families with children and for vulnerable people who become homeless through no fault of their own.</p><p>There is a range of support for victims of domestic abuse.

This obliges the relevant judicial authority to take a decision on whether or not the person should remain in detention, and that must be taken in accordance with the law of the executing State. Therefore, each and every EU Member State must consider carefully whether a person can be legally detained or not. That is in keeping with the intention underpinning the principle of habeas corpus.</p><p>The Government has also introduced reforms to the operation of the Arrest Warrant that limit the unjustified detention abroad of individuals surrendered by the United Kingdom. For example, section 12A of the Extradition Act 2003 provides a bar to extradition on the grounds of &quot;absence of prosecution decision&quot;. This means that, in cases where the person is wanted to stand trial, extradition can only go ahead where the issuing State has made a decision to charge the person and a decision to try the person, or that the person’s absence from that State is the only reason for the failure to take the decision(s). This provision ensures that, where a State is simply not ready to try a person, extradition is refused and the person is not surrendered only to spend a potentially lengthy period in pre-trial detention.</p><p>Following our reforms, Section 21B of the same Act allows, with both the requested person’s and the issuing State’s consent, for the person’s temporary transfer to the issuing State or for the person to speak with the authorities in that State whilst he or she remains in the UK (for example, by video link). This provision ensures those who are subject to an Arrest Warrant have an opportunity to communicate with the issuing State without being surrendered. In a number of cases this may result in the issuing State withdrawing the Arrest Warrant (e.g. if it decides the person is not the person they are looking for), ensuring the minimum time possible will be spent in detention.</p><p> </p>",,"Lord Bates",,"2014-11-11T17:04:32.8253176Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101010/answer","Biography information for Lord Bates","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101010/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101010/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-10-27","Arrest Warrants","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the Written Answer by Lord Taylor of Holbeach on 4 August (HL1114) about the European Arrest Warrant, whether they consider that habeas corpus can be applied in other European jurisdictions following extradition; and, if so, how.","false","Biography information for Lord Stoddart of Swindon",,"Lord Stoddart of Swindon","HL2466"

The report was published in July 2013 with a plan for action. <br><br>The actions were addressed primarily at the industry, British Bankers' Association and others including Local Enterprise Partnerships, supported by Government. Progress against the actions is set out below. <br><br>Action 1: Spreading the Word<br><br>The banking community continues to work with accountants, business groups and specialist business networks through the Enterprise Diversity Alliance and other forums such as the National Black Women's Network and the Yorkshire Asian Business Association, to raise awareness of the range of support available. This has included developing finance guides, refreshing the Better Business Finance website to make it more friendly, and running a national campaign aimed at all SMEs to inform them of the support available, including the appeals process if rejected for finance. <br><br>These details have been made available to ethnic minority businesses through key regional events, newsletters, and the various partners and networks that sit on the British Bankers' Association Diversity and Inclusion Business Council launched in 2014. The Authority also sits on the advisory group of the Enterprise Diversity Alliance, with a number of banks who also run specific Enterprise Diversity Alliance business support and finance work-streams.<br><br>Action 2: Making support easier to access<br><br>The British Bankers' Association, with banks, has run a series of mentoring workshops and because of these, and follow up bank support, some ethnic minority businesses have created their own mentoring networks and many of these businesses have taken up mentoring support. Events are held in areas with a high concentration of ethnic minority businesses notably Leicester, London, Wolverhampton and Birmingham, to raise awareness, understanding and build confidence in accessing finance. <br><br>Specialist mentoring is offered to ethnic minority businesses through mentoring organisations such as Business in the Community, Capital Enterprises and SCA Management Consulting Ltd. If a mentee wishes to specify a particular ethnicity for their mentor they can do so at the matching stage. <br><br>Action 3: Promote the alternatives<br><br>The Government is legislating through the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill to require large banks to refer declined small business finance applications to online platforms, who will seek to match businesses seeking finance to alternative lenders. Community Development Finance Institutions will be able to access these platforms alongside a range of other lenders, including challenger banks and peer-to-peer lenders. This proposal will help put small businesses seeking finance in touch with lenders who may be able to help them.<br><br>Action 4: Use Local Enterprise Partnerships to best advantage<br><br>Local Enterprise Partnerships have been established as voluntary partnerships and are encouraged by Government to ensure that their boards are representative of the businesses in their locality, and are not dominated by a single group or organisation.<br><br>Action 5: Expanding our understanding<br><br>The 2013 Ethnic Minority Business report http://www.sme-finance-monitor.co.uk/ was published earlier this year. The 2014 report is due to be published in January 2015. This work, coupled with that of the bank and BIS supported Enterprise Research Centre, is being used by the British Bankers' Association's Diversity and Inclusion Business Council to determine policy actions to take forward.<br><br>Action 6: Supporting the dialogue<br><br>The Ethnic Moinority Business representation at the Business Finance Roundtable is through Professor Monder Ram of Birmingham University who runs the Enterprise Diversity Alliance, co-leads the Enterprise Research Centre diversity work and is a member of DWP's Ethnic Minority Employment Stakeholder Group. Alongside this sits the British Bankers' Association Diversity and Inclusion Business Council launched in 2014 which includes the leading Ethnic Minority Business experts and networks. <br><br>As actions have been progressing since 2013, no further Ministerial meetings have taken place.<br><br></p>","Bristol West","Stephen Williams",,"2014-11-11T16:36:37.7326321Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101051/answer","Biography information for Stephen Williams","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101051/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101051/answer","Bristol West","Stephen Williams","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101051/answer/previousversion/25357","Biography information for Stephen Williams","7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-10-27","Business: Loans","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what progress his Department has made on each of the six actions outlined in his Department's report, Ethnic Minority Businesses and Access to Finance, published in June 2013; what external meetings Ministers have had to discuss (a) those actions and (b) the issues raised in the report in each month since the report; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Chuka Umunna","Streatham","Mr Chuka Umunna","211994"
