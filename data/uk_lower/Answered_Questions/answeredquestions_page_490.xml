As part of changes to the new computing programmes of study which will be taught from September 2014, e-safety will be taught at all four key stages. This will empower young people to tackle cyberbullying through responsible, respectful and secure use of technology, as well as ensuring that pupils understand age-appropriate ways of reporting any concerns they may have about what they see or encounter online.</p><p>The new curriculum also offers opportunities to tackle the underlying causes of bullying; for example the new citizenship programme of study sets out a requirement for pupils to be taught about the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom and the need for mutual respect and understanding.</p><p>The Department for Education is providing £4 million of funding over two years from 2013 to four anti-bullying organisations: Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and the National Children's Bureau consortium. While this funding has been awarded to specific projects to reduce bullying in general this can, and does, include work to tackle cyberbullying.</p><p>The Department has produced case studies showing good practice in how to manage behaviour and bullying. These include a case study about how a school deals with cyber-bullying. Also through funding provided by the Department the Anti-Bullying Alliance has produced specific advice on cyberbullying for children and young people with special educational needs and or disabilities. We provide a link to this in our own advice on preventing and tackling bullying.</p><p>Government ministers have regular meetings with internet providers, social media platforms and search engines on matters related to internet safety, including cyber-bullying. Ministers from the Department for Education, Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport also co-chair the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) which brings together a range of experts across government, law enforcement, industry, academia and charities to consider the best ways to minimise the risk of harm to children when online.</p><p>In July 2013 the Prime Minister announced measures to support parents to install free and easy to use internet filters which can block access to harmful websites. The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have now rolled out easy to use filtering to all new customers and will confirm that, by the end of 2014, 95% of all homes with an existing internet connection will be required to choose whether to switch on a whole home family friendly internet filter. The filters are constantly being refined and updated by the ISPs to keep families as safe as possible in the fast changing digital world.

Different mechanisms are expected to be needed to meet different balancing needs in the transmission and distribution networks, depending on the characteristics they offer, such as their peak power; duration of storage; and response times. The extent of deployment and effect of storage on energy costs will depend on the composition of future electricity systems – both supply and demand – as well as the cost and availability of storage and the other balancing technologies.<br> <br> Research carried out for the Carbon Trust by Professor Goran Strbac and a team at Imperial College and published in June 2012 in a report titled ‘Role and Value of Energy Storage Systems in the UK Low Carbon Energy Future', concluded that: “energy storage can bring benefits to several sectors in the electricity industry, including generation, transmission and distribution, while providing services to support real-time balancing of demand and supply, network congestion management and reduce the need for investment in system reinforcement”.

There were no cautions administered for murder.</p><p><del class="ministerial">Simple cautions (previously police cautions) are a non-statutory disposal available to the police to dispose of any offence committed by an adult and designed for dealing with low level, mainly first time offending. The Government does not believe that cautions are appropriate for serious offences.

This guidance states that the use of a simple caution for indictable only offences, such as rape, should only be given following authorisation by the CPS. These will be cases where there were exceptional circumstances which would mean that it was not in the public interest to prosecute.</p><p> </p><p>The overall number of simple cautions issued has halved since 2007. The cautioning rate, that is, the number of offenders cautioned as a percentage of offenders who were either cautioned or convicted, in 2013 was 20 per cent; this has declined from a peak of 31 per cent in 2007.</p><p>The Government is clear that serious offences should always be brought to court and to ensure that there is increased public confidence in the justice system last year announced limits on the use of simple cautions. These changes restrict the use of cautions for indictable only offences and certain serious either way offences unless there are exceptional circumstances and a senior police officer, as well as the CPS for certain cases, has agreed that a caution should be administered.</p><p>The MOJ guidance on Adult Simple Cautions was amended in November last year to reflect these changes, and we are currently legislating in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to place statutory restrictions around their use.</p><p> </p>","Ashford","Damian Green",,"2014-07-07T15:20:18.13Z","2014-08-28T11:45:56.4853257Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64819/answer","Biography information for Damian Green","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64819/answer","Offenders cautioned(1)(2) for selected offences, by month, England and Wales, 2010-2013(3).xls","Offenders cautioned(1)(2) for selected offences, by month, England and Wales, 2010-2013(3).xls","Offenders cautioned for selected offences -2010-13","Offenders cautioned for selected offences -2010-13","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64819/answer","Ashford","Damian Green","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64819/answer/previousversion/9230","Biography information for Damian Green","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64819/answer/previousversion/9230","Offenders cautioned(1)(2) for selected offences, by month, England and Wales, 2010-2013(3).xls","Offenders cautioned for selected offences -2010-13","54","Justice","Justice","2014-06-30","Police Cautions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many cautions have been issued for offences of (a) murder, (b) rape, (c) sexual assault, (d) robbery and (e) burglary in (i) each year between 2010 and 2013 and (ii) each month since January 2013.","false","Biography information for Jenny Chapman","Darlington","Jenny Chapman","203136"

These include targeted searching, random and targeted mandatory drug tests, the use of x-ray machines and CCTV surveillance cameras, Body Orifice Security Scanners to detect contraband secreted internally, and the imposition of closed (non-contact) visits. Prisoners found with prohibited items face swift and robust punishment. This can include having days added to their custody, being transferred to a different prison and losing privileges.</p><p> </p><p>The table below shows the number of individual instances where a drug

The ‘Keeping Children Safe in Education' guidance outlines the importance of tackling cyberbullying, which can be found online at:</p><p><a href="http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/schools-the-wider-sector/cyberbullying.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/schools-the-wider-sector/cyberbullying.aspx</a></p><p>Schools have the flexibility to develop their own measures to prevent and tackle bullying, but are held to account by Ofsted.</p><p>The Government recognises that educating young people about online safety is key to tackling cyberbullying. As part of changes to the new computing programmes of study which will be taught from September 2014, e-safety will be taught at all four key stages. This will empower young people to tackle cyberbullying through responsible, respectful and secure use of technology, as well as ensuring that pupils understand age-appropriate ways of reporting any concerns they may have about what they see or encounter online.</p><p>The new curriculum also offers opportunities to tackle the underlying causes of bullying; for example the new citizenship programme of study sets out a requirement for pupils to be taught about the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom and the need for mutual respect and understanding.</p><p>The Department for Education is providing £4 million of funding over two years from 2013 to four anti-bullying organisations: Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and the National Children's Bureau consortium. While this funding has been awarded to specific projects to reduce bullying in general this can, and does, include work to tackle cyberbullying.</p><p> </p><p>The Department has produced case studies showing good practice in how to manage behaviour and bullying. These include a case study about how a school deals with cyber-bullying. Also through funding provided by the Department the Anti-Bullying Alliance has produced specific advice on cyberbullying for children and young people with special educational needs and or disabilities. We provide a link to this in our own advice on preventing and tackling bullying.</p><p> </p><p>Government ministers have regular meetings with internet providers, social media platforms and search engines on matters related to internet safety, including cyber-bullying. Ministers from the Department for Education, Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport also co-chair the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) which brings together a range of experts across government, law enforcement, industry, academia and charities to consider the best ways to minimise the risk of harm to children when online.</p><p>In July 2013 the Prime Minister announced measures to support parents to install free and easy to use internet filters which can block access to harmful websites. The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have now rolled out easy to use filtering to all new customers and will confirm that, by the end of 2014, 95% of all homes with an existing internet connection will be required to choose whether to switch on a whole home family friendly internet filter. The filters are constantly being refined and updated by the ISPs to keep families as safe as possible in the fast changing digital world. The ISPs have also announced a new £25 million internet safety campaign over 3 years that will reach out to millions of parents on how best to protect their children and make good use of filters</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Mr Edward Timpson",,"2014-07-03T16:35:52.3025581Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64920/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64920/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64920/answer",,,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-06-30","Internet: Bullying","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he is taking to tackle cyber-bullying; and what resources his Department provides to charities which address this issue.","false","Biography information for Chris Evans","Islwyn","Chris Evans","904621"

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on a local authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and a local education authority (LEA) block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the EFS school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p><p>To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department has isolated the EFS school block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of ‘education' funding in that year.</p><p> </p><p>Figures for financial years 2005 to 2013 are shown below.

Dr Paul Watson, Regional Director for the Midlands and East Region, is leading the specialised commissioning taskforce. National discussions took place at the end of April and the taskforce was established in April 2014 in order to make some immediate improvements to the way in which NHS England commissions specialised services, and to put commissioning arrangements on a stronger footing for the longer-term. This taskforce comprises of seven distinct work streams, which will focus on financial control in 2014-15, and planning for the 2015-16 commissioning round. The seven work streams each have a distinct portfolio of work, some of which is short-term, and some of which includes looking to the future and the development of a sustainable and effective model of specialised commissioning.</p><p> </p><p>Around 50 additional individuals, from different disciplines, have been drawn from across NHS England, coming together to support intensive, focussed attention in a number of these work streams.</p><p> </p><p>There are aspects of the work which will require engagement with clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64541","Department of Health","false","2014-07-07","<p>Since April 2013, NHS England has been responsible for the commissioning of services that have been identified as specialised. NHS England's role is to ensure that the National Health Service delivers better outcomes for patients requiring these specialised services in a consistent manner across the country.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England is committed to commissioning and planning a healthcare system that seeks to reduce health inequalities. In line with the <em>UK Strategy for Rare Diseases</em>, NHS England promotes equity of access to allow everyone with a rare disease to follow a clear, well defined care pathway, in order to achieve high quality services for every individual through integrated personal care plans. The aim is to ensure no one gets left behind just because they have a rare disease.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England has advised that the review of specialised services commissioning was initiated at the start of May and will run for an initial period of three months. Dr Paul Watson, Regional Director for the Midlands and East Region, is leading the specialised commissioning taskforce. National discussions took place at the end of April and the taskforce was established in April 2014 in order to make some immediate improvements to the way in which NHS England commissions specialised services, and to put commissioning arrangements on a stronger footing for the longer-term. This taskforce comprises of seven distinct work streams, which will focus on financial control in 2014-15, and planning for the 2015-16 commissioning round. The seven work streams each have a distinct portfolio of work, some of which is short-term, and some of which includes looking to the future and the development of a sustainable and effective model of specialised commissioning.</p><p> </p><p>Around 50 additional individuals, from different disciplines, have been drawn from across NHS England, coming together to support intensive, focussed attention in a number of these work streams.</p><p> </p><p>There are aspects of the work which will require engagement with clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). In consultation with the Commissioning Assembly, a specific working group has been established to enable the joint discussions with CCGs to take place. The first meeting of this group was on 4 July.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England advise that there are currently no plans to consult on the outcome of the work of the taskforce.</p><p> </p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison","202924 ; 202935","2014-07-07T15:43:47.6169695Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64541/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64541/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64541/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-06-27","Health Services","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will make it his policy that there should be equality of access to treatment for patients in England with specialised conditions.","false","Biography information for John Glen","Salisbury","John Glen","202919"

Time unlocked includes time where a prisoner is either out of their cell or where the cell door is unlocked allowing them to move freely in and out of the cell.</p><p> </p><p>Time unlocked was discontinued as a performance indicator for prisons at the end of 2011-12 because it was not used in the day-to-day management of prisons and NOMS had concerns over the burden on the frontline of collecting the data. Indicators introduced into prison SLAs in respect of rehabilitation, resettlement and work in prisons provide a better demonstration of efforts to prepare prisoners for release and reduce reoffending.</p><p> </p><p>Figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems, which, as with any large scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. Figures for time in cell for the years 2012-13 and 2013-14 could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p><p> </p><p>Work in prisons is a key priority to ensure prisoners are engaged purposefully whilst they are in custody. It also gives them the opportunity to learn skills and a work ethic which can increase their chances of finding employment on release, a key element to reducing reoffending.</p><p> </p><p>The number of prisoners working in industrial activity across public sector prisons increased from around 8,600 in 2010-11 (the first year for which figures are available) to around 9,700 in 2012-13. This delivered an increase in the total hours worked in industrial activities from 10.6 million hours to 13.1 million hours. Private sector prisons have also been supporting this agenda and have reported that they delivered over 1½ million prisoner working hours in commercial and industrial workshops in 2012-13 which provided work for over 1,200 prisoners. In addition there are substantial numbers of prisoners who work to keep prisons running on tasks such as cooking, serving meals, maintenance and cleaning.</p><p> </p><p>Figures for public sector prisons are published in the NOMS Annual Report Management Information Addendum:<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225225/mi-addendum.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225225/mi-addendum.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p>The establishment-level breakdown of weekly hours worked is not available centrally for 2011-12 and 2012-13 and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the proportion of prisoners classed as unemployed is not available centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p><p> </p><p>Our reforms to the Incentives and Earned Privileges national policy framework came into effect in adult prisons on 1 November 2013. Prisoners will be expected to engage in purposeful activity, as well as demonstrate a commitment towards their rehabilitation, reduce their risk of reoffending, behave well and help others if they are to earn privileges.</p><p> </p><p> </p>","Kenilworth and Southam","Jeremy Wright","202862 ; 202863 ; 202864 ; 202865","2014-07-01T12:33:48.9940171Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64553/answer","Biography information for Jeremy Wright","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64553/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64553/answer",,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-06-27","Dartmoor Prison","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many hours per week prisoners in HM Prison Dartmoor spent (a) in cells and (b) working in each of the last three years; and what proportion of such prisoners were classed as unemployed on the latest date for which information is available.","false","Biography information for Ian Mearns","Gateshead","Ian Mearns","202900"
