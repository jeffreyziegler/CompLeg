This included our intention to recommend main language and proficiency in English, as was the case in 2011.</p><p> </p><p>In 2011, the guidance notes for the main language question in 2011 read: ‘Your main language is your first or preferred language. It could be the language you were brought up using, the one you feel most comfortable using, the language you use at home, or the one you use most often’.</p><p> </p><p>ONS is finalising its plans for guidance notes (including a definition of the main language) for the 2021 Census and intends to complete this work in 2019. For the 2021 Census, ONS will offer a wide variety of services to provide all respondents with help and assistance to complete their questionnaires.</p><p> </p><p>The 2011 Census was the first to gather information on main languages used and English language proficiency. This followed a programme of research, consultation, testing and analysis[2] to establish the most suitable questions. Data from these questions have been used to identify people for whom English is not their main language and to identify areas where a particular language is in use. This information helps councils and other organisations plan support strategies and monitor the impact of policies. Data have also been used for targeting the delivery of services, such as language support, translation, and study programmes at a local level to promote integration and cohesion within communities, to help eliminate discrimination, and to ensure that people are treated fairly.</p><p> </p><p>The topic consultation[3] held in 2016 ahead of the 2021 Census established there was still a user need for the data produced by these questions. You may be interested to read our topic report on language[4] for more information.</p><p> </p><p>Recommendations on the content and conduct of the 2021 Census are being put forward in a White Paper, which is planned for publication later this year. The final topics and questions to be included in the 2021 Census will be put before Parliament for approval, in the form of a Census Order in 2019 and Regulations in 2020.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p><strong>John Pullinger</strong></p><p><em><strong> </strong></em></p><p>[1]<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/censustransformationprogramme/questiondevelopment/2021censustopicresearchdecember2017" target="_blank">https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/censustransformationprogramme/questiondevelopment/2021censustopicresearchdecember2017</a></p><p>[2]<a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160110072835/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/final-recommended-questions-2011---language.pdf" target="_blank">https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160110072835/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/final-recommended-questions-2011---language.pdf</a></p><p>[3]<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/censustransformationprogramme/consultations/the2021censusinitialviewoncontentforenglandandwales" target="_blank">https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/censustransformationprogramme/consultations/the2021censusinitialviewoncontentforenglandandwales</a></p><p>[4]<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/census/censustransformationprogramme/consultations/the2021censusinitialviewoncontentforenglandandwales/topicreport11language.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/census/censustransformationprogramme/consultations/the2021censusinitialviewoncontentforenglandandwales/topicreport11language.pdf</a></p><p> </p>",,"Lord Young of Cookham",,"2018-12-14T11:10:42.403Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1020259/answer","Biography information for Lord Young of Cookham","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1020259/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1020259/answer",,,,,"53","Cabinet Office","Cabinet Office","2018-12-05","Census","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the next census, due in 2021, will include questions asking about respondents’ (1) main language, and (2) proficiency in English, as was the case in 2011; whether, when using census data to inform public policy, they consider a person’s main language to be the (a) first language learnt, or (b) language used most frequently; and what discussions they have had with the Office for National Statistics about how the terms in questions relating to language might be clarified for the 2021 census, including through associated guidance notes.","false","Biography information for Lord Blunkett",,"Lord Blunkett","HL12057"
