This work will see the organisation of the adult male prison estate - including local prisons -simplified into three key functions: reception, training and resettlement. Reception prisons will manage men on remand, fixed recalls and those with a very short time to serve, and they will allocate other individuals for transfer to the next prison. Resettlement prisons will prepare people for release into the community, and they will hold shorter-sentenced men, as well as people transferred from training prisons. To support reconfiguration, we have developed evidence-based Models for Operational Delivery (MODs) for each prison function and also for specialist cohorts. The MODs are best-practice toolkits that will enable governors and commissioners to deliver effective services for their functions and specialist cohorts. The combination of building new prisons and the reconfiguration of the existing estate will address basic issues such as safety and decency, reduce crowding, and drive improvements in rehabilitation. By improving the match between the supply of places and the demands of the population men will be able to progress through the estate to access the right regimes for their needs and prisons will be able to better carry out their function.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","Penrith and The Border","Rory Stewart",,"2018-10-22T16:44:43.003Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/989645/answer","Biography information for Rory Stewart","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/989645/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/989645/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-10-17","Prisons: Reviews","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, with reference to page 4 of the 17 October 2018 Annual Report of the Independent Monitoring Board on HMP Bedford, if he will undertake a review of the role of local prisons.","false","Biography information for Mohammad Yasin","Bedford","Mohammad Yasin","180839"

The Taskforce is developing a Prison Drugs Strategy for publication this autumn which supports and complements the National Drugs Strategy published by the Home Office in 2017. Our approach is centred around the same three objectives: restricting supply, reducing demand and building recovery. We are supporting prisons in reducing all types of drug use, with a particular focus on PS and the unique challenges they bring. In September 2016, we became the first prison service in the world to introduce innovative mandatory drug tests for psychoactive substances, a significant step in tackling the supply and use of them. We have made it a criminal offence to possess psychoactive substances in prison and trained more than 300 sniffer dogs specifically to detect these drugs. We will shortly be providing guidance on how to counter the evolving methods used by suppliers such as impregnated paper. The creation of a new specialist Financial Crime Unit to identify and disrupt the organised crime gangs fuelling drug dealing in prisons was announced by the Secretary of State for Justice at the Conservative Party Conference. The unit is staffed by members of the Police and Prison Service and is able to freeze bank accounts linked to organised crime and to make arrests. This action will cut the supply of drugs to prisoners and prevent money reaching criminal kingpins. We are supporting Bim Afolami MP’s Private Member’s Bill on substance testing in prisons. This legislation will simplify and strengthen the drug testing framework, allowing us to test for all psychoactive substances, as well as prescription-only and pharmacy medicines, helping to identify where they are being abused.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p>","Penrith and The Border","Rory Stewart",,"2018-10-24T16:50:34.727Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/988791/answer","Biography information for Rory Stewart","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/988791/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/988791/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-10-16","Prisons: Synthetic Cannabinoids","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what strategy his Department has to tackle the use of synthetic cannabinoids in prisons.","false","Biography information for Jared O'Mara","Sheffield, Hallam","Jared O'Mara","180298"

Providing the right interventions at the right time is vital to improving outcomes. Liaison &amp; Diversion services place clinical staff at police stations and courts, to provide assessments and referrals to treatment and support. They also provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, so that decisions and sentences can be tailored to meet their needs. Liaison and Diversion services continue to be rolled out across England, and were at 82% at the end of March 2018. Full roll out is expected by 2020-21. For those in custody, NHS England are responsible for commissioning and delivering health services in prisons in England. In Wales, healthcare is devolved to the Welsh Government. However, we recognise the importance of the prison environment on enabling better health outcomes. To June 2018, we have recruited an additional 3,653 frontline prison officers who will help improve prison regimes and access to healthcare. This will also enable us to implement the key worker role, giving staff dedicated time to provide one-to-one support to individual prisoners and, for example, identify where mental health support may be needed. We are also working to improve prison staff training around mental health, including providing revised suicide and self-harm prevention training. Over 17,000 prison staff have completed at least one module of the revised suicide and self-harm prevention training. We are currently reviewing the mental health element of the Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) to ensure it provides staff with the knowledge and confidence to recognise and respond appropriately to new or unreported mental health problems, or to recognise when existing problems are deteriorating.
