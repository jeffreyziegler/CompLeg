Deportations are a specific subset of removals which are enforced either following a criminal conviction or when it is judged that a person’s removal from the UK is conducive to the public good. The deportation order prohibits the person returning to the UK until such time as it may be revoked. Published information on those deported is not separately available. As such, the question has been interpreted as referring to enforced removals. In an enforced removal, it has been established that a person has breached UK immigration laws and / or has no valid leave to remain in the UK. They have declined to leave voluntarily and the Home Office enforces their departure from the UK.</p><p>The following table provides the total number of enforced removals of asylum cases, from Q1 2010 to Q3 2015.</p><p>In the year ending September 2015, there were 3,646 enforced removals of people who had previously sought asylum. The number of enforced asylum removals is influenced by a number of factors including the overall number of applications for asylum and changes in the nationality mix of those applying for asylum (i.e. an increase in those nationalities applying for asylum that are more likely to be granted will lead to fewer asylum removals).</p><p>The Home Office publishes quarterly and annual statistics on the number of persons removed or departed voluntarily from the UK within Immigration Statistics.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/442978","Department of Health","false","2016-01-11","<p>Since the publication ofthe National Stroke Strategy, diagnosis and treatment of stroke has improved in a number of areas:</p><br /><p>- access to immediate brain scanning has improved with 46% of patients being scanned within one hour of hospital arrival and 90% within 12 hours;</p><br /><p>- stroke patients do better when they are treated on a stroke unit. 83% of stroke patients now spend more than 90% of their time in hospitalon a stroke unit;and</p><br /><p>- clot busting drugs give a certain cohort of stroke patients a better chance of regaining their independence. Almost 12% of all stroke patients admitted to hospital receive these drugs – a rate that is higher than most other developed countries.</p><br /><p>Since publication of the strategy, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published technology appraisal and interventional procedures guidance on a number of new technologies to treat or prevent stroke and transient ischaemic attacks. Further information is available at:</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/cardiovascular-conditions/stroke-and-transient-ischaemic-attack" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/cardiovascular-conditions/stroke-and-transient-ischaemic-attack</a></p><br /><p>The strategy has also encouraged the development of specialist care for stroke both in the acute phase and during rehabilitation. This combined with the Stroke Research Network (and subsequently the Clinical Research Network),funded through the National Institute for Health Research, has led to a huge increase in the number of people with stroke taking part in research, particularly randomised controlled trials.</p><br /><p>In terms of improvements in rehabilitation, there has been a significant growth in availability of services such as early supported discharge and community neuro-rehabilitation teams over recent years. For example, recent data shows that 74% of hospitals had access to stroke specific early supported discharge and 72% to specialist community rehabilitation teams.</p><br /><p>Although these figures are encouraging, there is more to do. NHS England recognises this and, in collaboration with the Royal College of Physicians stroke programme and the Strategic Clinic Networks, is working with clinical commissioning groups to support areas where improvement is needed.</p><br /><p>The strategy remains valid and implementation of it continues.There are, therefore, no current plans to renew the national stroke strategy. Action is being taken to ensure the progress made on stroke continues. This includes:</p><br /><p>- ongoing work in virtually all parts of the country to organise acute stroke care to ensure that all stroke patients, regardless of where they live or what time of the day or week they have their stroke, have access to high quality specialist care;</p><br /><p>- publication of the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Outcomes Strategy in 2013, which includes many stroke specific strategic ambitions;</p><br /><p>- a CVD expert forum, hosted by NHS England, to coordinate delivery of the work which was initiated in the CVD Outcomes Strategy; and</p><br /><p>- NHS England’s National Clinical Director for Stroke works with the Strategic Clinical Networks, CCGs, voluntary agencies and individual providers to support better commissioning and provision of stroke care.</p><br /><p>More generally, the NHS Five Year Forward Viewrecognises thatquality of care, including stroke care, can be variable and that patients’ needs are changing and new treatment options are emerging.

Almost 12% of all stroke patients admitted to hospital receive these drugs – a rate that is higher than most other developed countries.</p><br /><p>Since publication of the strategy, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published technology appraisal and interventional procedures guidance on a number of new technologies to treat or prevent stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.

This combined with the Stroke Research Network (and subsequently the Clinical Research Network),funded through the National Institute for Health Research, has led to a huge increase in the number of people with stroke taking part in research, particularly randomised controlled trials.</p><br /><p>In terms of improvements in rehabilitation, there has been a significant growth in availability of services such as early supported discharge and community neuro-rehabilitation teams over recent years. For example, recent data shows that 74% of hospitals had access to stroke specific early supported discharge and 72% to specialist community rehabilitation teams.</p><br /><p>Although these figures are encouraging, there is more to do.

The result is that patients from South Asian background wait much longer for organ transplants, particularly for a kidney transplant. Therefore, to support the wider 2020 strategy, the Department funded Kidney Research UK to undertake a Peer Educator Programme within the Pakistani Muslim community in Birmingham with the aim of raising awareness of the lack of donors and increasing the numbers on the bone marrow and organ donation registers. Lessons learnt will support the roll-out of the programme in other similar areas of work.</p><br /><p>NHSBT also has a wide range of leaflets promoting organ donation that are translated into a number of different South Asian languages including Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu.</p><br /><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2016-01-15T13:29:47.51Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443012/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443012/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/443012/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-01-06","Organs: Donors","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he is taking to encourage the take up of organ donor cards among South Asian and other minority ethnic communities.","false","Biography information for John Spellar","Warley","John Spellar","21358"
