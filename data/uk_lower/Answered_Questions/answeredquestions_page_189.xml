The future schedule for the Restoration &amp; Renewal Programme will depend largely on when both Houses take a decision on the preferred delivery option, and on what that decision is. If both Houses accept the Joint Committee’s recommendation, then it will be necessary to acquire, design and fit out temporary accommodation, and to complete the refurbishment of the House of Commons Northern Estate, before decant can take place. There will also be several years of design work, including consultation with Members of both Houses and more widely, which will be followed by a procurement phase for the works. The Joint Committee recommended the establishment, by statute, of an independent Sponsor Board and Delivery Authority to deliver the Programme. Assuming that a decision on the future direction of the Programme can be taken soon, we expect that this work could be completed in time for decant to take place in 2025.</p><p>The forecast cost of repair and maintenance of the Palace of Westminster from 2017/18 to 2021/22, the end of the current Medium Term Investment Plan period, is set out in the table below.

We welcome Dr. Marshall’s request for employers to invest more in their training. The government is working with employers to design and deliver a skills system that is more responsive to their needs. We are taking steps to increase the supply of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills by supporting new institutions such as NMiTE, a new engineering university in Hereford, and the Institute of Coding, where a consortium of employers and universities will ensure Higher Education courses meet the needs of the economy. We are also funding interventions such as the Stimulating Physics Network and the new Level 3 Mathematics Support Programme to improve the standard of STEM education and engage more young people in these subjects. In 2017, there were 35,000 more entries to STEM A levels compared to 2010, an increase of 17 percent.</p><p>We are supporting the Institute for Apprenticeships, an employer–led body which is leading the development of apprenticeship standards and assessment plans. From April 2018, the Institute will assume responsibility for T level standards. 214 new employer-designed apprenticeship standards are now ready for delivery, with over 300 more in development. Take up of higher-level apprenticeships in 2016/17 was up by nearly 35 per cent compared to 2015/16 and there were 24,600 apprenticeship starts in 2016/17, increasing from 4,300 the year before. Before Christmas, over 3,000 higher and degree apprenticeships from over 40 high profile employers were being advertised.</p><p>We are introducing an ambitious ‘National Retraining Scheme’ to boost adult learning. This will bring together government, businesses and employees through the Confederation of British Industry and the Trade Union Congress. A set of sector-focused and employer-driven initiatives starting this year will target immediate skills shortages in key sectors, with £64 million for construction and digital skills.</p><p>Skills Advisory Panels (SAPs) will help align skills provision with local employer demand. The first seven SAP areas are West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Leeds, Greater Lincolnshire, Thames Valley Berkshire, and Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly.</p><p>We are encouraging a high quality, viable and resilient Further Education sector comprised of a range of providers, capable of attracting outstanding teachers and leaders to deliver these changes successfully. The department has committed up to £500 million a year to support the delivery of T levels once all routes are available and announced an extra £20 million for colleges to invest in the workforce to deliver new T level qualifications.</p><p>The department is also investing in new Institutes of Technology and supporting National Colleges to address the need for specialist skills. <strong><br> </strong></p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/820539/answer",,,,,,"2018-01-25T17:32:45.587Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/820539/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/820539/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-01-10","Skilled Workers: Vacancies","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the results of the British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey, published on 10 January, which reported skills shortages at “critical levels”.","false","Biography information for Lord Taylor of Warwick",,"Lord Taylor of Warwick","HL4620"

Following recent investigations into the risks of feeding fallen stock to dogs, controls have been strengthened to stop the feeding of offal to dogs, which may present a greater risk of disease such as bovine TB. Hunt kennel staff are undergoing training in co-operation with APHA on how to safely remove and dispose of offal when preparing material for feeding to hounds.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, new rules are in place requiring that hounds fed on fallen stock are regularly treated for Echinococcus sp (tapeworm) in accordance with the recommendations of a veterinary professional, and that records are kept of such treatment for a period of at least two years and made available for inspection by APHA. These measures should reduce the risk of disease spread from feeding of fallen stock to hounds, and we have no plans for further investigations.</p><p> </p><p>Specifically in relation to the potential spread of TB, dogs pose a very low risk of transmitting TB to cattle herds and, overall, they play an insignificant role in the persistence of the disease in England. Nevertheless, APHA has offered advice to hunt kennels on options for managing this very low risk. As part of its normal investigation into all culture-confirmed cases of TB in domestic animals other than cattle, APHA seeks to identify the various ways that those animals could have become infected.

The fall in number of defendants appearing before court and changes in the mix of offences coming to court are key factors in overall decreased numbers of community sentences. The sentencing framework already gives courts the flexibility to select community order requirements which are a robust alternative to custody, and are tailored to address the specific issues that contribute to reoffending. We are committed to ensuring that community penalties are tough, effective and command the confidence of sentencers. <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="10"><p><strong>Total number of community sentences handed down in each year, England and Wales, 2008 - 2016 <sup>(1)(2)</sup></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"><p>Total community sentences</p></td><td><p>2008</p></td><td><p>2009</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p>2016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>190,172</p></td><td><p>195,977</p></td><td><p>189,333</p></td><td><p>177,603</p></td><td><p>151,183</p></td><td><p>126,535</p></td><td><p>112,638</p></td><td><p>114,286</p></td><td><p>102,938</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="10"><p>(1) The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.
