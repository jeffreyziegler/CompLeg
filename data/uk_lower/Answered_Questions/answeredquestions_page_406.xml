More importantly, this measure was required to bring about parity of treatment between private and social rented sectors tenants because it is only fair that housing benefit claimants living in the social sector should make the same considerations as private sector tenants about the affordability of their rent rather than relying upon the taxpayer to meet the costs of housing that may be too large for their needs.</p><p> </p><p>Providing blanket exemptions to the policy were not considered to be the most effective or affordable approach to targeting resources for those who are vulnerable. Nor was it considered right that the taxpayer should provide bedrooms in separate households for the same child where parents are separated especially as this could act as a disincentive to work.</p><p> </p><p>To mitigate the impact for those facing difficult situations money was added to the Discretionary Housing Payment scheme. For instance this financial year £60 million has been added specifically for this measure. This however forms only part of the overall funding of £125 million for 2015/16, and since April 2013, £470 million has been provided in DHP funding.

(2010)[i]. This method considered boundary placement to delineate protected areas for harbour porpoise using a perimeter length to area ratio approach. By comparing areas with the top 1%, 5% and 10% of porpoise densities, the perimeter–area ratio was lowest (desirable) and its confidence interval was narrowest (greater certainty) for areas defined by the top 10% threshold (i.e. equivalent to the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile). The Inter-Agency Marine Mammal Working Group therefore considered it appropriate to adopt this published approach for the analyses undertaken in Report 544. Both Embling et al. (2010) and Report 544 have been subject to peer review by experts.</p><p>Member States, including the UK, use Annex III of the Habitats Directive and additional EU Guidance in the identification of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), but decisions on implementation are taken at the national level. This includes the determination of appropriate thresholds.</p><p>The identification of breeding sites for porpoise is not a requirement of Annex III of the EU Habitats Directive. A representative large-scale picture of porpoise calve distribution could not be attained from the data set that informed Report 544, and therefore was unable to support the identification of breeding areas.</p><p>The CCW Atlas of Marine Mammals of Wales included data collected and reported on in Pierpoint 2006 and 2008. All data from the Atlas were submitted to the Joint Cetacean Protocol, which provided the dataset that informed Report 544 where consents from the data providers were given.</p><p>The designation of SACs is a devolved responsibility, and decisions with regards to the Swansea Bay area are for the Welsh Government.</p><p>Report 544 is one step in wider assessment of information towards the identification of possible SACs for harbour porpoise, carried out by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and Country Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies.

On 3 August 2015, NHS England published guidance requiring all clinical commissioning groups to develop these plans, working across the NHS, health and wellbeing boards, public health, local authority, youth justice and education sectors. These plans should cover the full spectrum of interventions: from prevention to support and care for existing, or emerging mental health problems, as well as transitions between services and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. A national programme of work to support local transformation is under way, which includes tackling stigma, improving data and information to inform greater transparency and accountability and developing a specialist and stronger workforce.</p><p> </p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2015-09-14T16:01:55.693Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/416797/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/416797/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/416797/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-09-04","Mental Health Services: Children and Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he is taking to improve support for children and young people with mental health issues.","false","Biography information for David Mackintosh","Northampton South","David Mackintosh","8436"

In the 2013/14 CSEW the offender was believed to be under the influence of drugs in an estimated 304,000 violent incidents (23% of violent incidents) compared with around 373,000 incidents (20% of violent incidents) in 2010/11.
