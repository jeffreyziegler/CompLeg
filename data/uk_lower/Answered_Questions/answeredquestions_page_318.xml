This new research, which was funded by Defra, provides further evidence that badgers and cattle contribute to the spread of bovine TB in areas where the disease is rife. Previous research has concluded that TB spreads within and between populations of badgers and cattle and that spread from badgers to cattle is an important cause of herd breakdowns in areas where the disease is widespread. Our strategy does not presume that direct contact between badgers and cattle is the most important route of TB spread between the two species and the new research does not provide evidence against the effectiveness of badger control. Biosecurity guidance promoted by Defra addresses all forms of TB spread and focuses on indirect contact between badgers and cattle in particular, as this type of contact has previously been identified as significant.

We must stand together against such hate crime and ensure that it is stamped out.</p><p>We already have in place some of the strongest legislation to tackle hate crime in the world – this includes specific offences for racially and religiously aggravated activity and offences of the stirring up of hatred on the grounds of race, religion and sexual orientation. We also have stronger sentences for hate crime.</p><p>The Government has committed to taking action to improve our response to hate crime. This includes joint training between the police and Crown Prosecution staff to improve the way the police identify and investigate hate crime; building on the improvements to police recording of hate crime by working with the police to break down religious-based hate crime by religion; and working with victims and advocacy groups to improve victims confidence to come forward and report such crimes.</p><p>The police are also improving their operational practices and recording. Last year, the College of Policing published Operational Guidance for officers responding to hate crime which comprehensively covers how to address all forms of hate crime.</p><p>On 26 July, the Home Office published a comprehensive new hate crime action plan which builds on the work already done, and sets out Government action over the next four years to tackle hate crime. It includes:</p><p>● new steps to boost reporting of hate crime and support victims;</p><p>● new CPS guidance to prosecutors on racially aggravated crime;</p><p>● a new fund for protective security measures at places of worship, which is currently open for applications; and</p><p>● additional funding to community organisations tackling hate crime, including racist hate crime.</p><p>The increased levels of hate crime reporting seen over the summer have now reduced and we have observed three consecutive weeks of reporting levels that fall within the expected levels that we have observed in previous years. Police will continue to monitor the signs of tension and will react swiftly if they identify any future raised levels.</p><p>Nobody in this country should live in fear because of who they are and anyone who experiences hate crime should report it to the police, either in person at a police station, online through the True Vision website, or by phoning 101.</p>","Truro and Falmouth","Sarah Newton",,"2016-09-08T14:46:19.437Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/574154/answer","Biography information for Sarah Newton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/574154/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/574154/answer",,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2016-09-02","Racial Hatred","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps she has taken to reduce racist hate crimes since the EU referendum.","false","Biography information for Mr Barry Sheerman","Huddersfield","Mr Barry Sheerman","44716"
