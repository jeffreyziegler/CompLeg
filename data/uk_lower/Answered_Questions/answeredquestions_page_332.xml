To support this, we are launching a new two year fund, which will be open to local authorities across the country including those from rural areas, to bid for funding for refuges and other forms of accommodation based support and to help local areas take the steps they need to meet the National Statement.</p><p>This builds on the £3.5 million funding in 2015/16 and is on top of the £10 million funding to strengthen the provision of safe accommodation in the last spending review period. The Government does recognise the distinct challenges faced by victims of domestic abuse in rural areas and has supported bids for funding from rural areas for example Suffolk, Shropshire and Somerset.</p><p>Our Troubled Families Programme is about transforming the way local services support families with multiple problems. It incentivises services to come together, working with and understanding the needs of the whole family instead of constantly reacting to their individual problems. 29% of families in entry to the programme between 2012 and 2015 were experiencing domestic violence or abuse.</p>","Nuneaton","Mr Marcus Jones",,"2016-06-08T15:39:40.103Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/521536/answer","Biography information for Mr Marcus Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/521536/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/521536/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2016-05-25","Domestic Abuse: Rural Areas","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what plans the Government has to provide (a) refuges and (b) other support to family members in rural areas experiencing domestic abuse and other relationship problems; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Sir Greg Knight","East Yorkshire","Sir Greg Knight","38492"

In 2012, Border Force was, for the first time, provided with an operating mandate which set out parameters for operational decision-making, including the need to maintain 100% checks on all passengers arriving at passport control at all times. Border Force has also become more intelligence-led - adept at utilising increasing volumes of advance data to make targeted interventions against potentially dangerous passengers and consignments of goods upon arrival in the UK.</p><p>Other important changes include: an improvement in command and control arrangements so that Border Force can rapidly respond and adjust to evolving security threats across different locations; employing new leadership in headquarters and ports across the country to install a more security-focussed culture in the organisation and plan effective operations with partner organisations at both a national and international level. Border Force has also increased the capability of its officers to respond to security threats, by equipping all permanently employed staff working at passport control with powers and training to detain individuals that pose a threat to the public who are subject to an arrest warrant or otherwise liable to arrest.</p><p>These reforms have had a transformative effect on Border Force. As well as undertaking its traditional immigration and customs roles more effectively and efficiently, it has also proved capable of meeting a range of new strategic priorities, including rapidly implementing a screening regime in response to the global ebola outbreak and being a international leader in its work to identify victims of trafficking and slavery. Furthermore, in the past year Border Force has seized nearly 8 tonnes of Class A Drugs, more than two and half times as much as in 2009/10.</p>","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire",,"2016-06-09T16:04:27.407Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/521629/answer","Biography information for James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/521629/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/521629/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2016-05-25","UK Border Force","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps her Department has taken to increase the effectiveness of the UK Border Force as a law enforcement organisation since it was established as an independent operational command within her Department in 2012.","false","Biography information for Edward Argar","Charnwood","Edward Argar","38471"

This is in line with the recommendations of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p><p>The Government’s implementation of the EU Audit Directive and Regulation will include measures to require regular tendering of auditor appointments. Under implementing regulations currently laid before Parliament, all companies that are banks, building societies or insurers, or which have securities admitted to a regulated market, will be required regularly to subject their audit engagement to tendering. The maximum duration of an audit engagement will be limited to 20 years (currently there is no maximum duration). This will be introduced on a phased basis with some longstanding engagements given a further 4 or 7 financial years after the regulations come into force before they must be brought to an end and tendered to new auditors.</p><p>The provision on joint audit in the EU Regulation would act as an exemption from having to retender with the frequency envisaged by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The Government consulted on the implementation of the Audit Directive including this option, and concluded the option should not be taken up.</p><p>Joint audit is not a practice followed in the UK, though it is expressly permitted by the Companies Act and legislation on some other entities.

The option in the EU Regulation could result in prolonged audit engagements (up to 24 years) and fewer changes in auditor. This would be contrary to the objective of the CMA, which is to increase retendering of audits.</p><p>The CMA considered the impact of joint audits on competition and concluded that promoting joint audits would have little effect on barriers to entry, expansion and selection. The CMA’s conclusions were based on views provided by a range of stakeholders. The CMA was not able to quantify the potential cost of imposing joint audits, but did state that they believed that across the market the costs would be potentially significant.
