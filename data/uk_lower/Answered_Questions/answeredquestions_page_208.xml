The training is available not just for head teachers, teachers and teaching assistants, but also for school governors and support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism. The Trust has also published national autism standards for educational settings and a competency framework for those working with children and young people with autism.</p><p>In addition to our work with the AET, the Department for Education has also supported a number of initiatives to support schools in meeting the needs of pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND).
