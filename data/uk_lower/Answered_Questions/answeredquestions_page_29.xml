Russia's membership of the Council of Europe provides access, valued by Russian citizens and human rights NGOs, to the European Court of Human Rights and is one of the few ways available to the international community to hold Russia to account for its human rights violations.

For instance, PAYE data covers most applicants who claim working tax credits and receipt of other benefits included in the checks will overlap with receipt of child tax credits.

The NHS Long Term Plan sets out that “every ICS will need streamlined commissioning arrangements to enable a single set of commissioning decisions at system level. This will typically involve a single Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) for each ICS area”. However, this will need to reflect local circumstances, and NHS England is not intending to impose this centrally. NHS England is working with ICS and local areas to determine the best configuration of CCGs.</p><p>CCGs have a legal right to apply for a merger and it is for NHS England to decide whether to approve a merger. This is an operational decision, and so sits with NHS England. There are a number of specific legal factors and further criteria that NHS England will consider when deciding whether to agree the merger. The application process and criteria applied for CCG mergers is available in the Procedures for clinical commissioning groups to apply for constitution change, merger or dissolution guidance.</p><p>The criteria include the proposed new CCG demonstrating alignment with (or within) the local STP/ICS to provide the most logical footprint for local implementation of the NHS Long Term Plan. CCGs must also include evidence of providing strategic, integrated commissioning to support population health; whilst ensuring that the move to a larger geographical footprint will not be at the expense of local accountability, or the proposed new CCG’s ability to engage with, and consider the needs of, local communities.

This will require ambitious action across the economy building on our Clean Growth Strategy, and carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) is likely to play a vital role. Our CCUS Action Plan sets out that we will move to deploying CCUS in the 2020s, working in partnership with industry to achieve this.</p><p> </p><p>We are investing over £50 million in CCUS innovation programmes, supporting innovative technologies across the UK between 2017 and 2021. As part of this investment we announced on 27 June that nine companies have secured £26 million of government funding, in addition to industry backing, to advance the rollout of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in the UK - a crucial step towards the UK’s net zero emissions and the end of the UK’s contribution to global warming. It is the next milestone for the Government’s ambition for the UK to be a world-leader in the field as laid out in the Clean Growth Strategy and the CCUS Action Plan.</p><p> </p><p>One company, Tata Chemicals is being awarded £4.2m toward the construction of a facility to capture and utilise 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – the equivalent of 22,000 cars. When fully operational in 2021 it will be the largest carbon capture plant in the UK, removing 100 times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than the country’s current largest facility.</p><p> </p><p>Our Clean Growth Grand Challenge Mission sets an ambition to establish at least one low-carbon industrial cluster by 2030, and the world’s first net-zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040. The Mission is technology neutral but is focussed on technologies that can be delivered cost-effectively through the use of shared networks, and CCUS is one of the key technologies that could help to deliver the mission. The mission is backed by £170 million public investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund.</p><p> </p><p>Also supporting the mission, the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund is a £315 million fund aimed at helping industry to transition to a low-carbon future. The fund will help companies cut their energy bills and carbon emissions through investing in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies.

Friend, the Secretary of State for Education, is required by legislation to intervene in underperforming maintained schools rated inadequate by Ofsted and to issue an academy order for the school to become a sponsored academy. Recent research found that sponsored academies, particularly those open longest, have made substantial gains in performance in comparison with similar non-academy schools. The latest figures show that over 7 out of 10 sponsored academies are good or outstanding, replacing schools that were mostly underperforming. 85% of children are now in good or outstanding schools, compared to just 66% in 2010, and this is in part down to our reforms.</p><p>Where academies choose to come together in academy trusts, they can take advantage of economies of scale and drive down the costs of procurement and so are able to invest more in teaching.

They cited a number of reasons, including that there are more people in work overall and far fewer workless households, for example, there are 667,000 fewer children in workless households compared with 2010. Furthermore, far fewer pensioners are poor than ever before, primarily driven by increased government spending on pension benefits. This has raised the relative poverty line resulting in more ‘in work’ households falling below the line in recent years than they would have done without these increases in pensioner incomes.</p><p>The IFS estimated that the remaining third of the increase is due to two main factors: that earnings have risen less quickly towards the bottom of the distribution than the top and that housing costs have risen faster for poorer households than richer ones.</p><p>We know that there is more to do to support working people. The Chancellor has set out the Government’s ambition to end low pay across the UK. The National Living Wage, rose to £8.21 an hour in April 2019 and is expected to benefit over 1.7m people. The government is working to ease issues around high housing costs by delivering over 1.3 million extra homes in England since 2010. The Government is now on track to raise housing supply to 300,000 per year on average by the mid-2020s.

That is why last summer we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy. This sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now, but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all. In its first year, our Rough Sleeping Initiative (RSI) provided over 1,750 new bed spaces and 500 staff.  This year we have expanded the RSI with investment of £46 million for 246 areas – providing funding for an estimated 2,600 bed spaces and 750 staff.</p><p>Local authorities are ultimately responsible for the allocation of funding resources within their respective geographical areas.

These advisers have visited or had one-to-one contact with all 326 local authorities, focusing on the implementation of the Homelessness Reduction Act and also working very closely with them to bring down the number of people in bed and breakfasts over 6 weeks.</p><p>In addition to the above, MHCLG have overhauled the statutory homelessness data collection alongside the introduction of the Homelessness Reduction Act. This will give us better insights into the causes of homelessness and the support people need, with data broken down to local authority level.
