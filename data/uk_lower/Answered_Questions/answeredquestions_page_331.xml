To support the local NHS in shaping services for people with CFS/ME, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published a clinical guideline on the management of CFS/ME in adults and children, which set outs best practice on the care, treatment and support of people with the condition.</p><p> </p><p>Although there is no cure for CFS/ME, there are treatments that may help to ease symptoms. The NICE guideline on CFS/ME recommends treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy approaches, which have the clearest research evidence of benefit. However, the guideline is clear that there is no one form of treatment to suit every patient. Treatment approaches will not be appropriate for all patients and the needs and preferences of patients should be taken into account. Shared decision-making between patients and healthcare professionals should take place during diagnosis and all phases of care. Furthermore, patients should be offered information about local and national self-help groups and support groups for people with CFS/ME and their carers.</p><p> </p><p>NICE last reviewed the guidance with its stakeholders, including CFS/ME charities during 2013. The review found no update was required.
