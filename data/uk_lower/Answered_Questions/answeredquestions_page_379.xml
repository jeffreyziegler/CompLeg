As of 10 December 2015 a total of 80 courts closed under the Court Estate Reform Programme have been sold attracting disposal receipts of £49.6m.</p><br /><p>The disposal of surplus property assets is dependent on a number of factors, such as the market, potential future use, location and the fact that some are occupied in part by the police and local authorities which also make disposal difficult. Nine of the closed court buildings which have not been disposed of are either under offer or on the market. Of those which have not yet been brought to the market, two court buildings have shared locations with the police, which means the future of the building is tied in with the Police Station, one has a site contamination issue and the other three were closed only within the last seven months. We are working on bringing all of them to the market as soon as possible.</p><br /><p>There are temporary costs associated with making sure unused buildings are kept secure, protecting the fabric of the building and property rates payable to local councils. In addition, decommissioning the buildings to make them ready for sale results in some costs which cannot be disaggregated from the overall running costs. However, these are significantly lower than the costs of running the courts when open, which will have included estates costs, staffing costs and the cost of the judiciary.</p><br /><p><strong>Table: Monthly cost of each court building which has been closed but not disposed of since May 2010 as at 10 December 2015</strong></p><br /><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Court building</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Average monthly cost<sup>1</sup></strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Abergavenny Magistrates’ Court<sup>4</sup></p></td><td><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alton Magistrates’ Court<sup>2</sup></p></td><td><p>£9,828</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bracknell Magistrates’ Court</p></td><td><p>£5,319</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cirencester Magistrates’ Court</p></td><td><p>£1,472</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Coleford Magistrates’ Court</p></td><td><p>£1,561</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Keighley Magistrates’ Court (sitting at Bingley)</p></td><td><p>£2,011</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Knutsford Crown Court<sup>2</sup></p></td><td><p>£9,274</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Liverpool Magistrates’ Court<sup>5</sup></p></td><td><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lyndhurst Magistrates’ Court</p></td><td><p>£1,783</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oswestry Magistrates’ Court / County Court</p></td><td><p>£2,269</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pontefract Magistrates’ Court</p></td><td><p>£1,957</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stourbridge County Court<sup>6</sup></p></td><td><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spalding Magistrates’ Court<sup>2</sup></p></td><td><p>£3,909</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Totnes Magistrates’ Court<sup>3</sup></p></td><td><p>£790</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Towcester Magistrates’ Court<sup>3</sup></p></td><td><p>£445</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><ol><li>Monthly cost based on financial year data 2014/15 (unless otherwise stated).

I refer my noble Friend to the Written Ministerial Statement made by my noble Friend the Lord Astor of Hever on 7 January 2014 (Official Report, column 169WS).

Data is held centrally from October 2012 for the Maritime Reserve, April 2012 for the Army Reserve, and April 2013 for the Royal Air Force (RAF) Reserve. Recruitment targets for FR20 were not set until October 2013 following the publication of the Reserves White Paper. Official statistics for Regular recruitment targets which may be meaningfully compared to the official intake statistics are not produced.</p><br /><p>The Naval Service utilises a wide range of initiatives to increase the number of recruits, such as targeted marketing, specific recruitment events, career extensions and the use of retention incentives. There are also some specific mechanisms in place to attract recruits in specialist areas, such as staged remunerative awards to new entry Engineer Officers with relevant degrees, and the Direct Entry Technician Scheme, a one year trial to recruit suitably qualified and experienced personnel from private industry.</p><br /><p>Recruitment into the Army is up. We are confident that our plans to recruit and retain the right mix of Regular and Reserve personnel are robust and viable. We continue to look at ways of attracting people from all walks of life into the Army. Our high-profile marketing campaign continues across various media platforms. The Army has launched a new Officer recruitment campaign, 'With Heart. With Mind', showcasing the Army Officer as a highly-skilled career that offers leadership, challenge and the opportunity to do something that makes a difference. We have made real improvements to the application pipeline and continue to look at ways of making this as efficient as possible, while fostering candidate enthusiasm and motivation.</p><br /><p>A great deal of targeted activity is under way to improve recruitment and retention in the RAF. Proactive marketing of RAF Careers continues through a variety of media outlets, targeting specific branches and trades as well as offering recruitment and retention incentives. Recruitment events, such as the RAF Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) road show, nationally promote STEM and other roles within the RAF.</p><br /><p>We have made a number of improvements to ensure we reach our target strength of 35,000 trained volunteer Reservists by 31 March 2019. Central to this is an improved offer, which includes better training, better equipment, improved remuneration and an improved experience for Reservists. We have also widened the opportunity for Reservists to contribute on operations and established a new relationship with employers, as well as improving the support available to employers when a Reservist employee is mobilised. These actions are in addition to improving capacity and flow in the recruiting process and our marketing campaigns. As a result, more Reservists are joining either as new entrants to the military, or with prior experience either in the Regulars or in the Reserves. 8,660 joined in the 12 months to 1 November, a 56% increase on the equivalent period a year earlier. Trained strength has reached 26,290, ahead of the April 2016 target.</p><br /><p><br></p>",,"Earl Howe",,"2015-12-17T16:21:20.923Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/436052/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/436052/answer","HL4348_FR20_and_Regular_intake_-_TABLES[1].docx","HL4348 - Intake of FR20 and UK Regular Forces","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/436052/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2015-12-08","Armed Forces: Recruitment","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what were (1) the targets for recruitment, and (2) the actual number of recruits, to each of the Armed Forces for each year from 2010 to 2015; and what action they are taking to increase the number of recruits to the Armed Forces.","false","Biography information for The Marquess of Lothian",,"The Marquess of Lothian","HL4348"

The NRA is the next step in ensuring that our anti-money laundering regime is robust, proportionate and responsive to emerging threats. The NRA found that while the UK’s response to money laundering and terrorist financing risks is well developed, more could be done to strengthen the UK’s anti-money laundering regime. The Treasury and Home Office are working together on a comprehensive Action Plan to address these issues, to ensure that the UK continues to lead the global fight against illicit financial flows.</p>","West Worcestershire","Harriett Baldwin",,"2015-12-16T16:17:44.377Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/436142/answer","Biography information for Harriett Baldwin","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/436142/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/436142/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2015-12-08","Money Laundering","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, what recent steps the Government has taken to reduce the incidence of money-laundering in the UK.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","19232"
