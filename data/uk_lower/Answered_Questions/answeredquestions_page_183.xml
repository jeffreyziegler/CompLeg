That is why the Department has worked closely with industry and other stakeholders on the Action Plan for Information on Rail Fares and Ticketing Information launched in December 2016 to make it easier for passengers to choose the right fares for them. Today, all ticket vending machines (TVMs) in the country will alert customers if they have selected a more expensive type of the same ticket. Many train companies have taken a step further to introduce a voluntary TVM price guarantee promising a refund of the additional ticket costs to passengers who find that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey.</p><p> </p>","Orpington","Joseph Johnson",,"2018-01-30T15:52:32.207Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/828708/answer","Biography information for Joseph  Johnson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/828708/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/828708/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2018-01-23","Railways: Tickets","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what steps his Department is taking to ensure that ticket machines at train stations always offer the lowest available fares.","false","Biography information for Justin Tomlinson","North Swindon","Justin Tomlinson","124358"

This makes them quicker and easier to use and reduces the risk that a passenger buys a ticket that isn’t valid for immediate travel. However it can be frustrating for passengers if, by waiting a few minutes, they could have got a cheaper off-peak ticket. That is why, as part of the Action Plan for Information on Rail Fares and Ticketing Information, agreed with industry and launched in December 2016, , that train companies would upgrade vending machines so that they alert passengers when they will shortly sell off-peak tickets.
