This difference in the size of increases is a judgement – it is important to ensure service stability for those areas above target, and that increases for under target areas are not so large that resources are not used efficiently.

The Professional Standards Authority conducts annual reviews of the GDC’s fitness to practise process, to ensure it meets the set professional standards. The Dental Complaints Service, run by the GDC, can assist in resolving complaints raised about private dental treatment provided by all GDC registered dentists in the United Kingdom.

The Department’s estimates indicate that the change observed was within this expected range.</p><p>There was also some evidence that the number of fatalities of pedestrians aged 60 or over in 2013 was unusually low. Therefore the increase in fatalities could have been driven by the value returning to the expected or normal level. This is a common phenomenon known as ‘regression to the mean’ – i.e. that any abnormally large change in statistics (in this case, a sudden decrease in pedestrian fatalities aged 60 or over) will revert back to the normal level after some time.</p><p>Although the provisional figures for the year ending September 2015 do not include pedestrian fatalities specifically, the estimate for the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured (KSI casualties) was 4 per cent lower than for the year ending September 2014. If this is proved true in the final figures for 2015 it will support the hypothesis that there was no identifiable cause for the increase between 2013 and 2014.</p><p> </p>","Harrogate and Knaresborough","Andrew Jones",,"2016-06-21T10:14:23.06Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/524805/answer","Biography information for Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/524805/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/524805/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2016-06-13","Pedestrians: Accidents","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what assessment he has made of the reasons for the increase in pedestrian fatalities between 2013 and 2014.","false","Biography information for Daniel Zeichner","Cambridge","Daniel Zeichner","40290"

We have, for example, protected the overall school budget and increased the funding for children and young people with high needs by over £90 million this year. To ensure that local authorities have capacity to implement the reforms effectively, our additional funding included a £70 million SEN Reform Grant in 2014-15 to help local authorities plan for the SEN and disabilities reforms, and three grants (£45 million in 2014-15, £32 million in 2015-16 and £35.8 million in 2016-17) to local authorities to pay for the additional costs of implementing the reforms.</p><p> </p><p>All schools are required to put in place systems for the early identification of SEN and disabilities and to use their best endeavours to meet those needs. For most pupils with SEN, schools will meet needs through ‘SEN Support’. Schools will use the ‘graduated approach’, a cycle in which they assess what support is needed, plan and deliver it and then review its impact and improve the support a child actually needs. For those pupils with more complex or severe SEN and disabilities, following a multi-agency assessment, local authorities will issue an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan setting out the provision that must be made.</p><p> </p><p>A key element of the SEN and disabilities system and the recent reforms is ensuring that parents and carers are empowered to work with schools and others over the provision that is made for their children. By working together, families, local authorities and schools can provide more effective support to a child (in school and at home) to meet their SEN. For example, the 2014 Act requires local authorities to work with families over producing a Local Offer. That offer sets out in one place information about provision an authority expects to be available across education, health and social care for children and young people in its area who have SEN and disabilities, including those who do not have EHC plans. This should provide clear, comprehensive, accessible and up-to-date information about the available provision and how to access it. The offer should include what support is available to parents to aid their child’s development at home. The local authority has to publish a statement on short breaks for disabled children, young people and their families and this will form a core part of its offer. The statutory 0-25 SEN and Disabilities Code of Practice also describes a wide range of services that schools, Early Years providers, local authorities, health bodies and others provide to families to help meet SEN within the home. This includes, for example, services for pre-school age children and therapies that include programmes for implementation at home.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson",,"2016-06-14T16:37:36.033Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/524234/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/524234/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/524234/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-06-09","Special Educational Needs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what support her Department provides (a) at home and (b) in schools for children who have special educational needs and disabilities.","false","Biography information for Maria Caulfield","Lewes","Maria Caulfield","40174"

The New Employment Model Programme (NEM) is at the centre of activity being developed to address the underlying reasons individuals leave the Armed Forces and to help mitigate the impact of Service life on the family. The NEM was established to review the Terms and Conditions of Service to deliver a more modernised offer that allows personnel and their families more choice and reduce the impact of Service life on individuals and their families whilst still meeting the Services' needs.</p><p>The NEM has already introduced a number of changes to address personnel concerns about better opportunities outside the Service, including a set of Career Management Principles and Practices designed to support greater consistency in how careers are managed and realistic lifestyle choice based on employment, stability and location factors. This will enable personnel to access employment readiness training for spouses/civil partners through the new Career Transition Partnership contract; pilots are now running in the Royal Air Force and Joint Forces command. The Department has also secured LIBOR funding to support a business start-up programme designed specifically for Armed Forces families and a course to deliver vocational assessment and employability training for Service spouses.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has developed the new pay model as a simpler, more transparent system which provides Service personnel with greater pay predictability. It addresses some of the concerns about the previous pay model reported by personnel through both the Service Complaints system and the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey (AFCAS) and in feedback from the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). I fully expect these changes to be positive for morale overall.</p><p>Many personnel will experience an increase in pay as a result of the new pay model, and no one will take a cut in core pay on implementation. We have taken steps to ensure that personnel are aware of the range and nature of the pay reforms that began on 1 April 2016 and comprehensive internal communications activity has been undertaken to explain the changes. This included Departmental guidance to help personnel understand their new pay statement and any changes. Personnel, including those under pay protection, continue to remain eligible for any Government-approved pay award. Pay protection has been put in place to ensure that no one will take a pay cut on implementation of Pay 16 and this arrangement will exist for at least the first three years to ensure that no one is disadvantaged.</p><p>The new pay model is not designed as a cost saving exercise, but is a rebalancing of pay to make more efficient and effective use of the Armed Forces pay bill; the AFPRB will continue to recommend pay rates for all personnel. As we go forward the Service Complaints Process and AFCAS will be primary sources which inform our assessment of the benefits realised through the pay reforms. <strong><br></strong></p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster","40216 ; 40217","2016-06-15T14:10:41.043Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/523915/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/523915/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/523915/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-06-08","Armed Forces: Pay","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what assessment he has made of the potential effect on morale among members of the armed forces of the transition from Pay 2000 to the new Pay 16 pay structure.","false","Biography information for Kirsten Oswald","East Renfrewshire","Kirsten  Oswald","39957"
