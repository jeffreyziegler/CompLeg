This Government continues to spend over £95bn a year on welfare. Since 2016, we have invested an additional £1.7bn a year in Universal Credit, through a reduction in the taper rate, increasing the work allowances for households with children and disabled people and providing additional support for people moving onto UC from existing benefits.</p><p> </p><p>This Government has also made sure that work pays. The National Living Wage, rising to £8.21 an hour from April 2019, has given the UK’s lowest earners their fastest pay rise in 20 years. We have cut income tax for over 31 million people and taken four million low earners out of income tax altogether. A typical basic-rate taxpayer now has over £1,000 less in income tax than in 2010. Compared with 2010, there are now over 3.5 million more people in work, 1,024,000 fewer workless households, and, at a near record low, 665,000 fewer children living in workless households This means more families are getting more of their income through earnings. Working Age households and households with children in the bottom 20% of the income distribution now get just over half of their income from employment, up from just over 40% in 2010.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="9"><p><strong> </strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><p><strong> </strong></p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p><strong>

The Government has no plans to revisit the policy on women’s State Pension age as brought forward by the 1995 pensions Act or the 2011 Pensions Act, and does not intend to make further concessions. The changes in the 2011 Act occurred following a public Call for Evidence and extensive debates in Parliament. A concession limiting the increase in State Pension age under the 2011 Act in any individual case to 18 months, relative to the 1995 Act timetable, has already been made during the passage Act (at the cost of £1.1 billion).</p><p> </p><p>In the years after the 1995 legislation (1995 to 2011) this equalisation was frequently reported in the media and debated at length in parliament. People were notified with leaflets, an extensive advertising campaign was carried out, and later individual letters were posted out.</p><p> </p><p>Evidence submitted to the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee ‘Communication of state pension age changes’ in 2016 noted that there were more than 600 mentions of State Pension age equalisation in the national broadsheet and tabloid press between 1993 and 2006, an average of just under one per week between 1993 and 2006. There were 54 mentions in the press in 1995, the year in which equalisation was legislated for.

The trial aimed to test and compare the effectiveness of four of the main treatments available for people CFS/ME. These were adaptive pacing therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy, and standardised specialist medical care (SMC).</p><p> </p><p>The five-year trial involved over 600 participants, aged 18 and over, in Scotland and England. The first set of results from the trial were published in 2011 in the Lancet, and a number of other evaluations based on the trial have been published since. The trial results found both CBT and GET were moderately effective when provided alongside SMC and were better than adaptive pacing therapy or SMC alone in improving both symptoms and disability.</p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline ‘Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy): Diagnosis and management of CFS/ME in adults and children’, sets outs best practice for clinicians on the diagnosis, treatment, care and support of people with the condition. The guideline recommends CBT and GET as appropriate treatments for mild to moderate CFS/ME, in line with the best available evidence.</p><p> </p><p>The NICE guideline acknowledges that there is no one form of treatment to suit every patient and that treatment and care should take into account the personal needs and preferences of the patient. Decisions concerning the appropriateness of treatments should be made on a case by case basis.</p><p> </p><p>On 20 September 2017, NICE announced its decision to undertake a full update of the guideline, following a review of the latest available evidence on the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME and a public consultation.

These are used extensively by the government to inform policy development and understand how existing policies benefit parents.</p><p> </p><p>In September 2010, 15 hours of free weekly childcare was introduced for all children aged 3 to 4, which was extended from September 2017 to 30 hours for working parents of 3 to 4-year-olds. In 2013, 15 hours of free weekly childcare was introduced for disadvantaged 2-year-olds.

More than 700,000 of the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds have benefited from 15 hours free childcare since 2013, and more than 340,000 3 and 4-year-olds benefitted from our 30 hours offer in its first year, meaning parents are spending less on childcare or are able to work more flexibly.</p><p> </p><p>The government entitlements are supporting as many families as possible with access to high quality, affordable childcare.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1087548","Home Office","false","2019-03-26","<p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a crime and it is child abuse. The Government will not tolerate a practice which can cause extreme and lifelong physical and psychological suffering to women and girls. We strengthened the law in 2015, including through the introduction of Female Genital Mutilation Protection Orders (FGMPOs), which are often issued with the purpose of preventing FGM from happening. 296 FGMPOs were issued between Octo-ber 2015 and September 2018. The Government works closely with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ensure a robust and effective response to FGM.</p><p>Cases of FGM involving very young and vulnerable victims are among the most complex referred to the CPS. The CPS has appointed lead FGM prosecutors, and local investigation and prosecution protocols between the police and CPS are in place to ensure that robust cases for prosecution are built. A joint police and CPS focus group for so-called honour-based abuse (HBA), forced marriage and FGM is pushing for continuous improvement in the handling of HBA cases and an increased level of support for complainants and witnesses.</p><p>There are a number of specific issues with the prosecution of these crimes. They can involve victims being hurt and coerced by members of their own families and communities, making it difficult for them to feel confident to report the crime. Additionally, in many instances when cases are referred to the CPS, it does not have jurisdiction to prosecute, if the procedure was carried out overseas before the victim moved to the UK. Further, medical evidence alone cannot prove all the elements of the offence.</p><p>In 2015 Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary published a report – “The depths of dishonour – Hidden voices and shameful crimes” into the police response to so-called honour-based violence, forced marriage and FGM. This made 14 recommendations for improvement. Progress against those recommendations is monitored by the Home Office, including at a meeting on 27 February 2019 of the National Oversight Group for Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Harassment, chaired by the Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability.</p><p>The Government is working with communities and stakeholders to emphasise the adverse health consequences of FGM and the fact that it is illegal, including through a recent awareness-raising campaign and through ongoing outreach work by the Home Office’s FGM Unit.</p>",,"Baroness Williams of Trafford",,"2019-03-26T17:45:47.197Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1087548/answer","Biography information for Baroness Williams of Trafford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1087548/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1087548/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-03-12","Female Genital Mutilation: Prosecutions","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government, further to the answer by Baroness Williams of Trafford on 7 March (HL Deb, col 711), whether they will ask the Attorney General to invite the views of inspectorates of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service on the problems of prosecuting cases of FGM.","false","Biography information for Lord Morris of Aberavon",,"Lord Morris of Aberavon","HL14468"
