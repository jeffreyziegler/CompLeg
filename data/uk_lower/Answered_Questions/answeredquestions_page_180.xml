It can be considered in certain specific situations such as domestic violence or where financial abuse occurs or one partner mismanages the UC payment, but will not always be appropriate.

A document outlining the scope of the review, to consider the impact of the amendment regulations 2017, was shared with stakeholders in November 2017.

This is acknowledged in the question documents which the Department has sent to stakeholders. For example, in the question document sent to vulnerable group’s representatives, the introduction asks for stakeholders to indicate whether the evidence they present relates to the period before or after the relevant provisions of the Amendment Regulations 2017 came into force.

It will also help extend the lives of many mature fields and postpone decommissioning.’</em></p><p> </p><p>This builds on the £2.3bn of fiscal support the government has already provided to the UK oil and gas industry, including a package of tax cuts across Budget 2015 and 2016, £40m of funding for seismic surveys to support exploration, and the introduction of a new Investment Allowance.

As part of this we proposed the Presidential Statement passed at the UN Security Council in June this year, which called for an end to the fighting and a return to UN-led peace talks. We are now working urgently with our international and regional partners to ensure that the Security Council's words are converted into action. We call on all parties to respect these unified and clear demands from the international community. More recently, the Foreign Secretary hosted a meeting of his US, Saudi and Emirati counterparts in our Embassy in Paris on 23 January. They discussed ways of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, countering weapons smuggling and refocusing the political track to move towards a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2018-02-06T13:08:06.467Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/832961/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/832961/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/832961/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2018-01-29","Yemen: Peace Negotiations","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what steps his Department is taking to encourage progress on the peace talks between the parties to the conflict in Yemen.","false","Biography information for Richard Burden","Birmingham, Northfield","Richard Burden","125277"
