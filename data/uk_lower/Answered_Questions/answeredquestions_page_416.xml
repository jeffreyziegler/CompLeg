The granting of the Type Certificate by EASA in March 2013 was the culmination of the analysis and assessment of detailed evidence from the multinational flight trials programme and a range of other sources. Separately, an independent Certification and Qualification Organization, established by the partner nations, reviews all of the certification evidence and provides additional military certification expertise.</p><p>Prior to entry into service with the RAF, the UK Release to Service Authority (which is headed by the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff) endorsed the Release to Service (RTS) for the UK Atlas aircraft. The aircraft RTS is granted based on a number of recommendations provided by a range of competent individuals and bodies, including the Military Aviation Authority, the A400M Type Airworthiness Authority and independent experts. These recommendations also include the Safety Case (endorsed by the Duty Holder) which evaluates the relevant safety risks to establish the parameters for the safe operation of the aircraft. The RTS is part of the overall Aircraft Document Set for the UK A400M Atlas which stipulates, amongst other things, the bounds within which the aircraft should be operated and how it should be maintained.</p><p>Following the tragic loss on 9 May 2015 of a pre-delivery A400M aircraft, and in accordance with its continuing airworthiness obligations as the aircraft Design Organization and Type Certificate holder, Airbus Defence and Space has undertaken extensive investigations to establish the cause of the accident. As a result of this work the cause is now understood, and mitigation actions have been put in place to prevent a recurrence. These measures have been endorsed by the relevant certification bodies and were also considered, along with other evidence, by the RAF Operational Duty Holder (AOC 2 Gp) when the decision to resume RAF A400M flying was taken on 15 June 2015.</p><p>On this basis the Ministry of Defence is satisfied that there are no safety issues, and that the risks associated with operating A400M are fully consistent with its certified safety requirements - for the basic airframe and engine these are consistent with a civilian airliner - and that the platform is not subject to intolerable or unmanaged safety issues.</p>","Ludlow","Mr Philip Dunne",,"2015-07-06T15:45:10.83Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386238/answer","Biography information for Mr Philip Dunne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386238/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386238/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2015-06-29","Future Large Aircraft","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what outstanding safety issues there are relating to the A400m Atlas aircraft; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Mr Kevan Jones","North Durham","Mr Kevan Jones","4554"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386247","Department for Education","false","2015-07-07","<p>The Department for Education recognises the importance of brain development and nurturing in the early years. Research shows that high quality early education, in conjunction with effective parenting skills, has a positive influence on children’s confidence, their capacity to learn, and contributes to a sense of well-being and self-worth. The foundations for human development – physical, intellectual and emotional – are laid in early childhood. It is for this reason that the department has invested so heavily in the early education entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds as well as the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. The department has also brought forward a Childcare Bill to give families where all parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three- and four-year olds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The department has commissioned and evaluated a significant amount of research on early education, which encompasses consideration of a range of issues such as child development and nurturing. The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework, which all registered early years providers must follow, recognises that good parenting and high quality early learning together provide the foundation that children need to make the most of their abilities and talents as they grow up. The EYFS is based on evidence considered by Dame Clare Tickell in her 2011 review. A report of the evidence can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-review-report-on-the-evidence" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-review-report-on-the-evidence</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A number of other important reviews have also informed this department’s policy on early education. These include reports by Graham Allen MP in 2011 on early intervention and Professor Sir Michael Marmot in 2010 which highlighted the important lifelong effects that the early years (starting in the womb) has on many aspects of health and well-being, educational achievement and economic status. The reports can be found at:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-intervention-the-next-steps--2" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-intervention-the-next-steps--2</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61012/earlyintervention-smartinvestment.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61012/earlyintervention-smartinvestment.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/projects/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review" target="_blank">http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/projects/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The department also published research in 2014 on the CANparent trial, a government initiative to examine the development of a universal offer of parenting classes to enhance parenting skills and increase confidence. The report can be found at: <a href="http://www.canparent.org.uk/sites/default/files/Trial_evaluation_final_report__09_07_14_.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.canparent.org.uk/sites/default/files/Trial_evaluation_final_report__09_07_14_.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Child development in the early years remains a key research priority for this department. A major piece of longitudinal research, Study of Early Education and Development (SEED), has been commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of the current early education model in England. SEED will specifically examine the impact on child development of providing funded early years education to two year olds from lower income families. The study will follow the progress of over 5,000 children from the age of two, up until the end of key stage one at the age of seven. SEED will update evidence from the highly influential Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) that has provided crucial evidence of the benefits of high quality early years education. A full impact report is due in 2020.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although we do not have a separate funding stream to “ensure infants’ brains are stimulated and developed”, the department continues to invest heavily in the early education entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds and the most disadvantaged two-year-olds.
