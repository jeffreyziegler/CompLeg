Friend for Stratford-on-Avon referred to in the Answer of 23 July to Question 278350, my department’s Holiday Activities and Food programme is exploring ways to help disadvantaged children access free holiday club provision over the summer holidays, in 11 local authority areas, including Birmingham.</p><p>This summer, we have awarded £9.1 million to 11 organisations to explore how the funding and coordination of free holiday club provision at a local level can help more disadvantaged children access provision for free, and support providers to improve their offer. With this money, around 50,000 disadvantaged children and their parents will be able to access free holiday club provision, including a healthy meal and enriching activities.</p><p>The government provides a significant package of childcare support to parents and carers. All 3 and 4 year olds and the most disadvantaged 2 year olds are entitled to receive 15 hours a week of early education for 38 weeks a year. Since 2017, working parents of 3 year olds and 4 year olds have been able to access an additional 15 hours of early education a week, bringing their total to 30 hours a week. The 30 hours policy is worth up to £5,000 a year to families and, since its introduction, around 600,000 children have benefitted. Childcare providers can offer these entitlements stretched across the whole year so that they cover the school holidays.</p><p>In addition, tax-free childcare was introduced in 2017 to support families with the costs of childcare for 0 to 12 year olds. For every £8 that parents pay into an online account, the government will pay £2 - up to a maximum contribution of £2,000 per child each year - for children aged up to 12. Working parents in receipt of Universal Credit can also claim back up to 85% of eligible childcare costs through Universal Credit for children up to the age of 16, subject to a monthly limit of £646 for one child or £1108 for 2 or more children.

The Forum has delivered important work already, and made tangible progress. A sub-group of the Forum set up last summer, examined the issue of access to affordable credit, and made a number of recommendations, many of which formed part of a package on affordable credit presented at Budget 2018.

Friend, the Member for Louth and Horncastle on 15 July 2019, the statutory guidance on inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, titled ‘Working together to safeguard children 2018’, is very clear that anyone who has concerns about a child’s welfare should make a referral to local authority children’s social care. This should be done immediately, if there is a concern that the child is suffering significant harm, or is likely to do so. This guidance can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2</a>.</p><p> </p><p>That same guidance also sets out that assessments, including early help assessments, should look at the nature and level of risk faced by a child, and whether the risk is from within or external to the family. In response, local areas should have a comprehensive range of effective, evidence-based services in place to address assessed needs early.</p><p> </p><p>A number of our best performing local authorities, known as Partners in Practice, are testing different approaches to how best to assess and support children who are at risk of abuse from extra familial threats.

A decision on the status of shooting as an optional sport was taken at the 2015 Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly, and also reaffirmed in 2016, when the new CGF Constitution was approved.</p><p> </p><p>Shooting was not included at point of bid in the sport programme for the 2022 Games in Birmingham, but following interest from a number of the optional sports and disciplines, the Birmingham 2022 Organising Committee has recently concluded an Additional Sports review and costing exercise, considering the merits of adding additional sports, including shooting, to the Games within available resources. The review considered financial considerations and the potential for additional revenue generation, the availability of suitable venues, and alignment with the CGF Constitution and the objectives of Games partners. It also considered submissions from each of the sports concerned. Based on the conclusions from the review, the Organising Committee’s recommendation was to support the inclusion of Women’s Cricket, Beach Volleyball and Para Table Tennis, but not to add Shooting or Archery to the programme for Birmingham.This recommendation was subsequently approved by the CGF Executive Board, and confirmed by a vote of the Commonwealth Games Federation’s membership, who make the final decision on the matter. Looking ahead, any consideration of shooting’s inclusion in future games will be a matter for the Commonwealth Games Federation, and the Organising Committees of future Games.</p><p> </p><p>The Government does recognise the strength of feeling on the matter among the shooting community, and the desire to have an opportunity to showcase the sport in 2022, and as such I have spoken to the Commonwealth Games Federation regarding the matter. They have agreed to advise British Shooting on the next steps for taking forward proposals for an event for Commonwealth shooters, to be delivered separately from the Games. The responsibility for any event would sit with British Shooting, but I hope that this will give the shooting community in the UK the opportunity to compete against shooters from across the Commonwealth in a UK event in 2022.</p><p> </p>","Selby and Ainsty","Nigel Adams",,"2019-09-05T10:54:00.973Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1141470/answer","Biography information for Nigel Adams","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1141470/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1141470/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2019-07-23","Gun Sports: Commonwealth Games","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, what progress has been made in restoring shooting to the range of sports in the Commonwealth Games.","false","Biography information for Stephen Kerr","Stirling","Stephen Kerr","281126"
