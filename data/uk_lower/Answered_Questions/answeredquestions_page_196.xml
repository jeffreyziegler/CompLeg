NHS England’s priority is therefore to develop well-staffed and effective units capable of delivering safe care. NHS England is supporting networking between thrombectomy centres to cover extended daytime hours while service development is under discussion in each of the regions. Full 24/7 implementation of this relatively new technique across the country will take time. NHS England will explore the possibility of providing care to patients in remote areas using helicopter transfer.</p><p>NHS England is initially proposing to set up 24 thrombectomy centres providing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week which would require a minimum of five interventional clinicians for each centre (120 clinicians). Ultimately NHS England expects to need at least 30 centres to provide equitable geographical coverage, so would therefore need 150 interventionists.</p><p>To strengthen the available workforce, models of training are being discussed by Health Education England (HEE) and the General Medical Council (GMC). HEE is supportive of these models of training, which will consider interventional radiologists who are already registered as interventional radiologists and have an interest in neuro-intervention. This would form a two year training programme. The second element of this work is a credential model in collaboration with the GMC. The GMC are supportive of this work. Discussions have started to achieve a credentialing model for other appropriate consultant staff.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine","118944 ; 118945","2017-12-20T17:10:34.273Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805274/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805274/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805274/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-12-12","Strokes: Medical Treatments","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what support he plans to offer to regions unlikely to benefit from new mechanical thrombectomy innovations as a result of lacking trained interventional neuroradiologists?","false","Biography information for Chi Onwurah","Newcastle upon Tyne Central","Chi Onwurah","118946"

Prisoners must be risk assessed as suitable for Category D/open conditions before allocation to an open establishment.</p><p> </p><p>Category B prisoners are not routinely held in Category C prisons. If after reassessment a Category C prisoner is required to transfer to a Category B prison they are usually held in a segregation unit pending transfer to a suitable Category B establishment. On 13 December 2017, there were 20 such prisoners.</p><p> </p><p>The correct categorisation and allocation, balancing security issues and the needs of the prisoner, helps prisoners to use their sentences constructively, to tackle their offending behaviour and to prepare for their eventual release. All prisoners must be placed in the category consistent with the needs of security and control and the need to protect the public. Prisoners of a higher security category would not, as a matter of course, be held in an establishment of a lower category. The only exceptions to this will be where prisoners are re-categorised, and then await a move to a different establishment.</p>","East Surrey","Mr Sam Gyimah","119037","2017-12-20T11:47:15.417Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805368/answer","Biography information for Mr Sam Gyimah","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805368/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805368/answer",,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-12-12","Prison Accommodation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many category B prisoners are being held in category D prisons.","false","Biography information for Richard Burgon","Leeds East","Richard Burgon","119040"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805428","Ministry of Defence","false","2017-12-20","<p>Our Armed Forces are among the most extraordinarily talented and hard-working people in our society. We recognise the vital role that their families play, and that operational capability relies on recognising the Service person as part of a wider family unit. This is why we launched the first ever UK Armed Forces Families’ Strategy in 2016, which focuses and coordinates activity to support Service families. Priorities for this work include childcare, partner employment and accommodation, which have consistently remained areas of interest for both the Service Families’ Federations and the Department. In delivering the strategy we work closely with a number of external stakeholders to provide support to spouses and partners, for instance to those who are looking to gain employment, as we recognise that the demands of Service life can impact on the careers of family members.</p><p><br> Welfare support is provided to families via the single Service welfare organisations; additionally there are a significant number of other organisations that can be accessed via welfare referrals. The Covenant Fund has assigned £4 million to projects that support ‘Families in Stress’, enabling specialist organisations such as Relate to provide immediate or local support to families experiencing episodes of significant strain. To date the Fund has awarded eleven grants, totalling almost £2 million, to specialist and expert charities.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to keeping the range of welfare support under continual review and launching the Families’ Strategy, we have expanded the Defence People Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2017-2022 to incorporate all Defence People, including the families of Service personnel. We have also embarked on a partnership with the Royal Foundation to deal with issues of stigma and the treatment of mental health problems across the defence community. We are developing options for the Future Accommodation Model which recognise the 21<sup>st</sup> century family and we are developing flexible engagements for those who wish to vary their deployability to better fit their Service career around family life, all of which aims to contribute to increased family stability.</p><p> </p><p>A key component of the Families’ Strategy is to ensure that Service families are considered in people policy development, supporting the principles outlined in the Family Test. This is achieved through consideration of the Service family as part of each relevant submission or policy discussion, and through regular engagement with the single Services and the three Families’ Federations who represent the needs and views of Service families. The Department also monitors the development and implementation of policy to assess the impact on families. In the period since August 2014 none of the legislation implemented by the Ministry of Defence has required the application of the Family Test.</p>","Bournemouth East","Mr Tobias Ellwood","119131","2017-12-20T15:19:18.417Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805428/answer","Biography information for Mr Tobias Ellwood","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805428/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805428/answer",,,,,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2017-12-12","Ministry of Defence: Families","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the Answer of 30 November 2017 to Question HL3576, what steps his Department is taking to strengthen families.","false","Biography information for Fiona Bruce","Congleton","Fiona Bruce","119099"

DCMS is running a number of programmes that contribute to strengthening families. These include the Early Years Social Action Fund and Community Organisers Programme.</p><p> </p><p>The £1 million Early Years Social Action Fund is a joint partnership between Nesta and the Office for Civil Society and will focus on supporting families in need.. The fund aims to help more children aged four and under, achieve their developmental milestones through social action. The fund is backing projects where social action will build the confidence and knowledge of parents and primary carers, to support their children to achieve their developmental milestones ahead of their fifth birthday.</p><p> </p><p>Community Organisers act as local leaders, bringing people together to take action on the things they all care about. The original programme (2011-15) trained 6,500 individuals who built relationships and inspired local communities to deliver positive social change. Communities were supported to kick start over 2,000 community projects and our evaluation has shown us that 84% of the projects focused on connecting people together, including neighbours, residents, families and vulnerable people. In 2017 we launched the Community Organisers Expansion Programme which aims to further increase the number of Community Organisers trained to 10,000 by 2020.</p><p> </p><p>DCMS also has responsibility for Libraries, which change lives for the better.

As a locally accountable service, they are well-placed to respond to local needs and issues.</p><p> </p><p>Libraries can have a critical role in helping people to realise their potential, and especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Libraries provide vital support to families in developing children’s language and reading skills and confidence from early years onwards They also run numerous activities like book groups, code clubs, discussion groups and events for children and families. Libraries are places where communities and individuals can develop, share ideas and learn together, and libraries are actively looking at how they could offer more and different family learning opportunities. Alongside a report ( The Experiential Library: the future of family learning) The Society of Chief Librarians has created a toolkit to help libraries deliver family learning and is running events to help library services to share experiences to deliver this effectively.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, Sport England is supporting families through its Families Fund, a new investment of up to £40m into projects which offer new opportunities for families with children to get active and play sport together.</p>","Chatham and Aylesford","Tracey Crouch",,"2018-02-05T16:39:53.463Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805433/answer","Biography information for Tracey Crouch","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805433/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805433/answer",,,,,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2017-12-12","Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport: Families","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to the Answer of 30 November 2017 to Question HL3576, what steps her Department is taking to strengthen families.","false","Biography information for Fiona Bruce","Congleton","Fiona Bruce","119104"

The FNP is a programme of intensive home visiting by specially trained nurses which aims to support young mothers expecting their first child to improve outcomes.</p><p> </p><p>The Friends and Family Test (FFT) is a feedback tool used to improve services for patients. Since its launch in 2013, the FFT has been rolled out in phases to most National Health Service-funded services in England, giving all patients the opportunity to leave feedback on their care and treatment. The FFT has produced well over 30 million pieces of feedback so far – and the total rises by over a million a month – making it the biggest source of patient opinion in the world.</p><p> </p><p>We want better support for families with children and young people who are at risk of developing mental health problems. A Green Paper on children and young people’s mental health published on 4 December 2017 seeks to build on the progress already made. This ranges from setting up the first ever waiting times for mental health to supporting the recommendations of the 2015 Future in Mind strategy, through investing £1.4 billion to bring together all services working with children and young people to improve mental health services.</p><p> </p><p>All of NHS England’s work programmes have input from family/carer experts by experience and true collaborative partnership working with stakeholders where families are strongly represented. The Transforming Care Programme recognises that when children and young people have a learning disability, autism or both and behaviours that challenge and/or a mental health condition, the impact on the family as a whole can be significant. One of the key principles of our Transforming Care Service Model is that families are provided with the right support to help children and young people live in the community. In March 2017, NHS England introduced a Care, Education, and treatment review policy for children reflecting the vital role the parents and extended family play in the lives of people including children and young people with learning disabilities, autism or both. In September, NHS England published guidance to supplement the service model which was specific to children and young people “with learning disabilities, autism or both”.

We recognise the vital role that their families play, and that operational capability relies on recognising the Service person as part of a wider family unit. This is why we launched the first ever UK Armed Forces Families’ Strategy in 2016, which focuses and coordinates activity to support Service families. Priorities for this work include childcare, partner employment and accommodation, which have consistently remained areas of interest for both the Service Families’ Federations and the Department. In delivering the strategy we work closely with a number of external stakeholders to provide support to spouses and partners, for instance to those who are looking to gain employment, as we recognise that the demands of Service life can impact on the careers of family members.</p><p><br> Welfare support is provided to families via the single Service welfare organisations; additionally there are a significant number of other organisations that can be accessed via welfare referrals. The Covenant Fund has assigned £4 million to projects that support ‘Families in Stress’, enabling specialist organisations such as Relate to provide immediate or local support to families experiencing episodes of significant strain. To date the Fund has awarded eleven grants, totalling almost £2 million, to specialist and expert charities.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to keeping the range of welfare support under continual review and launching the Families’ Strategy, we have expanded the Defence People Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2017-2022 to incorporate all Defence People, including the families of Service personnel. We have also embarked on a partnership with the Royal Foundation to deal with issues of stigma and the treatment of mental health problems across the defence community. We are developing options for the Future Accommodation Model which recognise the 21<sup>st</sup> century family and we are developing flexible engagements for those who wish to vary their deployability to better fit their Service career around family life, all of which aims to contribute to increased family stability.</p><p> </p><p>A key component of the Families’ Strategy is to ensure that Service families are considered in people policy development, supporting the principles outlined in the Family Test. This is achieved through consideration of the Service family as part of each relevant submission or policy discussion, and through regular engagement with the single Services and the three Families’ Federations who represent the needs and views of Service families. The Department also monitors the development and implementation of policy to assess the impact on families. In the period since August 2014 none of the legislation implemented by the Ministry of Defence has required the application of the Family Test.</p>","Bournemouth East","Mr Tobias Ellwood","119099","2017-12-20T15:19:18.467Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805460/answer","Biography information for Mr Tobias Ellwood","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805460/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/805460/answer",,,,,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2017-12-12","Ministry of Defence: Families","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, to which legislation his Department has applied the Family Test, published in August 2014.","false","Biography information for Fiona Bruce","Congleton","Fiona Bruce","119131"
