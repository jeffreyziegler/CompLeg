The Department is coordinating work with the higher education sector to improve support for students as they move to university.</p><p>The priority given to 0-25 mental health services under the Long Term Plan has the potential to support this work. In particular, it can allow greater continuity of support for vulnerable children for whom other support already extends beyond 18, and for university students.</p><p>Local decision making is important to ensure this change supports the effective use of resources. The additional £1.4 billion made available to develop capacity and capability across the system from 2015-20 has already started to result in increased provision. The funding is linked to local transformation plans, drawn up by clinical commissioning groups with other local partners, which are intended to cover the all provision from prevention to specialist services.</p><p>The introduction of new mental health support teams linked to schools and colleges will be an important part of developing collaboration between education and health services.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041779","Department for Education","false","2019-01-21","<p>The government is committed to supporting young carers - to improve their health and wellbeing, and to protect them from excessive or inappropriate caring responsibilities. Since April 2015, all young carers are entitled to an assessment of their needs for support, under Section 17 of the Children Act (1989).</p><p>The ‘carers action plan’, a two-year programme of tailored work to support unpaid carers of all ages, aims to improve the identification of young carers; improving their educational opportunities and outcomes; providing support to young carers, particularly to vulnerable children; and improving access to services. The plan can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carers-action-plan-2018-to-2020" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carers-action-plan-2018-to-2020</a>.</p><p>In December 2016 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published the guidelines ‘End of life care for infants, children and young people with life-limiting conditions: planning and management’. The guidance emphasises the need to be aware that siblings will need support to cope with: their brother's or sister's condition and death, and the effects of their parents' or carers' grieving. This may include social, practical, psychological and spiritual support. The guidance can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng61" target="_blank">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng61</a>.</p><p>The Department for Education provides schools with £2.4 billion each year in additional funding through the pupil premium to support disadvantaged pupils; each eligible pupil attracts £1,320 to primary schools and £935 to secondary schools. Eligibility for the pupil premium is based largely on current or past claims for free school meals. Some research with young carers aged 14 to 16 suggested that around 60% already attract the pupil premium through their eligibility for free school meals.</p><p>We expect schools to make effective use of their pupil premium and do not tell them how to use it - schools know their pupils best and will spend the grant to meet pupil needs, which may include needs arising from a caring role. Schools are held to account for their pupil premium use through school inspection and information in performance tables, and most schools are required to publish details about their pupil premium strategy and its impact.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","208947","2019-01-21T11:21:26.257Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041779/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041779/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041779/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-01-15","Carers: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what funding the Government provides to support the siblings of children with palliative care needs who meet the definition of being young carers.","false","Biography information for Darren Jones","Bristol North West","Darren Jones","208948"

It is estimated that 0.1 per cent of adults (105,459) were victims of a religiously motivated hate crime in the 12 months prior to interview. The 2015/16 to 2017/18 CSEW showed that 0.8% of Muslim adults were the victim of religiously motivated hate crime, which was the highest percentage for a faith group where data is available.</p><p>The full breakdown from the CSEW is as follows:</p><p>Christian - (61,804) 0.0%</p><p>Buddhist - (489) 0.%</p><p>Hindu 0.5 - (1,326) 0.5%</p><p>Muslim - (3,480) 0.8%</p><p>Other - (1,553) 0.2%</p><p>No religion - (36,518) 0.0%</p><p>Statistics for police recorded crime, also published in October 2018, show that hate crimes motivated by religion have increased by 40% from 2016/17 to 2017/18, representing the largest percentage increase of all hate crime strands (comprising race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender). The 2017/18 police statistics were the first to reflect the mandatory break down of hate crime reporting by perceived religion, and provided a breakdown based on the targeted religion of victims of religiously motivated hate crimes .

Pacesetters include councils, a school and the learning disability charity Mencap, who have themselves hired a number of apprentices with learning difficulties or disabilities.</p><p>The Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network has been developed to provide insight and guidance on best practice in how to make sure that apprenticeships are undertaken by people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and all members make a commitment themselves to increasing diversity when they join. The network aims to inspire and influence the behaviour of other employers to attract, recruit and support more people from underrepresented groups into apprenticeships. This includes people with disabilities, people who identify as LGBT+, women in science, technology, engineering and maths and members of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. For example, Health Education England, working with members including Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, have a supported apprenticeship scheme focussing particularly on learners with autism. The National Autistic Society has been invited to attend the network’s next meeting.</p><p>Our funding system is intended to encourage the take-up and likely completion of apprenticeships by particular groups, including people with learning difficulties or disabilities. The system is also intended to recognise where additional support is necessary, through extra funding where the costs of supporting an apprentice are higher, and making sure that these costs are met by government and not by the employer.</p><p>Our communications and guidance products aim to encourage employers to hire apprentices with a learning difficulty or disability and to demonstrate to people with learning difficulties or disabilities, such as autism, that apprenticeships are an option for them.</p><p>We have integrated the Department for Work and Pensions’ Disability Confident campaign into the apprenticeship recruitment service so that the Disability Confident logo is displayed on apprenticeship vacancies for campaign-registered employers.</p><p> </p>","Guildford","Anne Milton",,"2019-01-21T17:17:44.943Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041260/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041260/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041260/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-01-14","Apprentices: Autism","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps her Department is taking to help employers to ensure that apprenticeships provide an effective route into permanent employment for adults diagnosed with autism.","false","Biography information for Thangam Debbonaire","Bristol West","Thangam Debbonaire","208304"
