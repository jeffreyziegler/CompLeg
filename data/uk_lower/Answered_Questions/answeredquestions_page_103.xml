For example:</p><p>- The financial benchmarking service, which allows schools to compare their performance and use of resources with other, similar schools, and also comparisons between academy trusts.</p><p>- Recommended deals that are helping schools to save money on the things they buy regularly, such as printers and photocopiers.</p><p>- A new deal to support schools with getting value for money when hiring supply teachers and other agency workers.</p><p>- Regional Schools Buying Hubs pilots in the North West and South West, providing hands-on support and advice to schools on complex procurement.</p><p>- A free teacher vacancy listing website to support recruitment needs and drive down recruitment costs is currently in pilot phase.</p><p>- Encouraging schools to integrate their curriculum and financial planning to inform decision making on the deployment of teaching staff.</p><p>- School Resource Management Advisers (SRMAs).
