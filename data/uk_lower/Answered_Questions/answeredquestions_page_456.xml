"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167973","Department for Business, Innovation and Skills","false","2014-12-17","<p>Government policy focuses on delivering growth; this in turn partly depends on longer term improvements to productivity. As such, much of the Government’s economic policy is about raising productivity, including but not limited to:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Tax cuts</strong>: Government is actively working to reduce the tax burden where possible to help give businesses the confidence to invest and grow. Initiatives announced at this year’s Autumn Statement include a doubling of the Small Business Rate Relief for a further year, and a continued cap on the annual increase in business rates at 2% from April 2015 to March 2016. More widely the UK now has the lowest headline corporate tax rate in the G7 and 4th lowest in the G20. Budget 2013 announced further measures to reduce the main corporate tax rate to 20% by 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Deregulation</strong>: Government departments are working together to simplify and reduce the regulatory burden for UK businesses through the Red Tape Challenge, One In, One Out , and One In, Two Out policies. This will create a regulatory environment in which businesses have the confidence to invest and grow. This work is already showing significant signs of success; excluding EU regulation, the estimated annual net cost of regulation to UK business has fallen by £1.5bn since 2011.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Ensuring employers have access to workers with the right skills plays a crucial role in enhancing the UK’s productivity. This Government has driven up participation in education, employment or training for 16-24 year olds since 2011. Apprenticeship participation has risen by 77% from 2009/10 to 2012/13, and there have been over 2 million Apprentices started since 2010.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government is giving employers more direct control over the design and delivery of training solutions to address skills shortages and improve business performance through the Employer Ownership Pilot (EOP) and its successor Employer Ownership Fund (EOF). The Government is completing round 2 of EOP which will be worth £238m and has announced targeted activity for the auto supply chain and engineering under EOF.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: High quality infrastructure is essential for supporting productivity growth. Delivering the right infrastructure at a local, regional and national level, across the UK, is therefore key to the government’s long-term economic plan. Since 2010, this Government has completed 55 major roads and local transport projects, completed major improvements to Kings Cross station as well as 400 other stations, opened Heathrow Terminal 2 and introduced £22 billion of private sector investment in water assets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Infrastructure Plan for 2014 outlines a £466 billion plan for the UK’s infrastructure, of which £189 billion is future investment. This includes £15 billion of road improvements, £38bn investment in rail and £46 billion investment in the gas and electricity network.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Science and Innovation</strong>: The government funds and supports innovation in science, technology and engineering to help the UK’s high-tech industries to thrive. This has already seen £600m of government funding committed to the development and commercialisation of eight great technologies, a further £106m investment in new Centres for Doctoral Training, which will train more than 750 new students, and £42m in the creation of the Alan Turing Institute – a world-class research institute specialising in Big Data science.

In both cases, the expressions of interest received after each prospectus were followed by due diligence and a contract agreement process.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167984","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2015-02-25","<p>Get Britain Building is a three-year scheme to provide development finance and support to unlock stalled sites. The scheme is on track to deliver, whilst managing the often challenging issues which hindered or stalled the sites in the first place (such as lack of finance, delays in planning conditions and other legal obligations, protracted sub-contractor negotiations, asbestos findings, site re-plans due to easements and utility diversions).</p><p> </p><p>From 2012-13 to September 2014, there have been 12,293 dwellings started, against the target of 12,000. The scheme is primarily aimed at unlocking stalled market housing, and is not an affordable housing programme as such; however, there have been 1,397 affordable starts which have been unlocked as part of wider schemes.</p><p> </p><p>Completions lag behind starts due to the time it takes to build out a site (especially given the challenging nature of some of the sites, as outlined above), but 4,890 dwellings had been completed to September 2014, and this figure will continue rising.</p><p> </p><p>More detailed figures are at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-statistics" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-statistics</a></p><p> </p><p>The hon. Member will no doubt wish to criticise and knock the scheme, but I would simply observe that we are cleaning up the mess left by the Labour Government’s housing crash.</p><p> </p><p>We estimate that the Get Britain Building programme is supporting between 1 to 2 jobs per unit, which suggests that up to 24,586 jobs have been supported so far.</p><p> </p><p>As I noted in my answers of 30 October 2014, Question 207630 and 23 January 2015, Question 219688, this is part of a package of measures to get stalled sites building.

Our new English curriculum places a renewed focus on the requirement for pupils to learn to read through systematic synthetic phonics, as evidence shows this is the most effective approach to early reading.

The Department believes that good headteachers are best placed to support the needs of their pupils.</p><p> </p><p>To boost the quality of phonics teaching, we have provided £23.7 million in match funding to over 14,000 schools, enabling them to buy systematic synthetic phonics products and training. We have also introduced a phonics screening check. The first three years of the check have enabled teachers to identify nearly 568,000 six-year-olds who needed extra support.</p><p> </p><p>For pupils who do not reach the expected level in reading by the end of primary school, we have introduced the Year 7 Catch-up Premium. This funding – £500 per pupil – enables secondary schools to deliver additional support for those pupils that most need it.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has also committed £8.8 billion of pupil premium funding for schools in England for the period between 2011-12 and 2015-16.

Prisons are encouraged to provide a range of physical activities that suit the particular population balance within resources/facilities available.</p><p> </p><p>It is also important to note that the design for the new Secure College Pathfinder includes enhanced sports facilities, including a running track, indoor gym hall and gym classroom. The range of facilities reflects the importance we place on physical education, sport and outdoor activities as part of an environment which is suitable for young people and an integral part of a sound and challenging education.</p><p> </p><p>Specific data on the number of hours a prisoner engages in physical activity is not available as this varies by individual prison and prisoner depending on the IEP level the prisoner is on, the behaviour of the individual, the availability of constructive activities and supervisory staff.</p><p> </p><p>NOMS recognises the importance physical activity plays in the overall well-being of prisoners and the effect PE can have on supporting other programmes designed to reduce offending behaviour.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-12-09T17:50:19.303Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/168068/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/168068/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/168068/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-12-04","Prisons: Sports","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what estimate he has made of the average number of hours per week offenders in (a) youth custody institutions and (b) adult prisons were physically active in each year since 2010.","false","Biography information for Dan Jarvis","Barnsley Central","Dan Jarvis","217230"

Some argued that the way to achieve the goal of a world without nuclear weapons was to ban weapons now, or to fix a timetable for their elimination. This approach fails to take account of the stability and security which nuclear weapons can help to secure. None of us would gain from a loss of that stability. The United Kingdom believes that the UN Disarmament Machinery and the Non-Proliferation Treaty provide the right forum for working towards a world without nuclear weapons. The UK Ambassador restated our concern at the humanitarian consequences which could result from the use of nuclear weapons. That is why the UK works extremely hard to prevent the use of nuclear weapons, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to keep our own nuclear weapons safe and secure. We are also committed to working towards a world without nuclear weapons. We shall, however, retain a credible, continuous and submarine-based deterrent for as long as the global security situation makes it necessary.

More evidence is available on the benefits of contour tree planting to mitigate pollutants such as nutrients and sediments, while pathogens, which impact bathing water quality, have been less studied. However, it is believed that woodland creation could help to reduce pathogen delivery to watercourses as a result of soil structure and hydrological benefits (e.g. improved soil infiltration, drier and better structured soils and reduced surface runoff).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Forestry Commission published a technical report in 2011 (<em>Woodland for water: Woodland measures for meeting Water Framework Directive objectives</em>), which set out the benefits of tree planting for water quality and flooding. The review highlighted how woodland creation could help to improve water quality by reducing nutrient, sediment and pesticide losses to water, as well as deliver other water and wider ecosystem benefits. This led to the development and use of national, regional and catchment ‘opportunity maps’ to direct planting to where woodland would be most effective within England.
