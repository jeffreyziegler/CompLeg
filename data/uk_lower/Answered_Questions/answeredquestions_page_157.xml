Sexual and Reproductive Health Profiles have been developed by Public Health England (PHE) to support local authorities, public health leads and other interested parties to monitor the sexual and reproductive health of their population and the contribution of local public health related systems. The Department closely monitors the range of indicators and outcomes at national level. Progress continues to be made: for example, in 2016, more people than ever were tested for sexually transmitted infections and the number of people infected fell, the under-18 conception rate in 2016 was 18.9 conceptions per thousand women aged 15 to 17 years; this is the lowest rate recorded since comparable statistics were first produced in 1969, declining by 10% since 2015 and 45% since 2010. The United Kingdom is one of the first countries in Europe to witness a substantive decline in HIV diagnoses. In 2016, 5,164 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in the UK (3,938 men and 1,226 women), representing an 18% decline from the 6,286 diagnoses reported in 2015. The decrease was most apparent in gay and bisexual men.

The report found that a greater proportion of epilepsy related deaths occur in areas of higher levels of deprivation. The rate of deaths associated with epilepsy in areas ranked as the most deprived in England is almost three times larger than in the least deprived; 13 deaths per 100,000 population compared to five deaths per 100,000 population. A copy of the report can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions</a></p><p> </p><p>Wider research has shown that epilepsy prevalence varies with social deprivation, but this is not well understood, and it is not clear whether this inequality in mortality is the consequence of the increased prevalence seen in deprived areas, of poor care, or both. However, deprivation is a well-known determinant of poor general health, and although there is insufficient evidence to describe the relationship as causal, it underlines the health inequalities link in relation to epilepsy related deaths.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is acting broadly to reduce health inequalities by addressing the social causes of ill health, promoting healthier lifestyles for all and tackling differences in outcomes of NHS services, all underpinned by legal duties. Through the Mandate the Government has asked NHS England to ensure service commissioning focuses on measurable reductions in inequalities in access to health services, in people’s experience of the health system, and across a specified range of health outcomes which contribute to reducing inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. National and local outcomes frameworks feature indicators to measure improvements across a range of areas, including inequalities, and the Mandate asks NHS England to do more in increasing the transparency on services and outcomes that these frameworks provide.</p><p> </p><p>At a national level, NHS England is the organisation responsible for securing and supporting high quality outcomes for people with epilepsy, and the vast majority of services for people with the condition are planned and commissioned by local clinical commissioning groups. Action is led locally to ensure the solutions put in place reflect the needs of individual communities.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England’s Rightcare programme provides practical support to local commissioners to tackle unwarranted variation, including in services for neurological conditions like epilepsy.

The report found that a greater proportion of epilepsy related deaths occur in areas of higher levels of deprivation. The rate of deaths associated with epilepsy in areas ranked as the most deprived in England is almost three times larger than in the least deprived; 13 deaths per 100,000 population compared to five deaths per 100,000 population. A copy of the report can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions</a></p><p> </p><p>Wider research has shown that epilepsy prevalence varies with social deprivation, but this is not well understood, and it is not clear whether this inequality in mortality is the consequence of the increased prevalence seen in deprived areas, of poor care, or both. However, deprivation is a well-known determinant of poor general health, and although there is insufficient evidence to describe the relationship as causal, it underlines the health inequalities link in relation to epilepsy related deaths.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is acting broadly to reduce health inequalities by addressing the social causes of ill health, promoting healthier lifestyles for all and tackling differences in outcomes of NHS services, all underpinned by legal duties. Through the Mandate the Government has asked NHS England to ensure service commissioning focuses on measurable reductions in inequalities in access to health services, in people’s experience of the health system, and across a specified range of health outcomes which contribute to reducing inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. National and local outcomes frameworks feature indicators to measure improvements across a range of areas, including inequalities, and the Mandate asks NHS England to do more in increasing the transparency on services and outcomes that these frameworks provide.</p><p> </p><p>At a national level, NHS England is the organisation responsible for securing and supporting high quality outcomes for people with epilepsy, and the vast majority of services for people with the condition are planned and commissioned by local clinical commissioning groups. Action is led locally to ensure the solutions put in place reflect the needs of individual communities.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England’s Rightcare programme provides practical support to local commissioners to tackle unwarranted variation, including in services for neurological conditions like epilepsy. NHS England is also working with the Neurological Alliance to support a new Neurology Advisory Group, led by Professor Adrian Williams, to align work across the system to improve neurological care. In addition to developing the neurology mortality report, PHE’s NIN provides a broad range of data on disease, services and outcomes, including for epilepsy, to support local commissioners to benchmark services and drive improvement.

Students on special educational needs (SEN) Support are entitled to a termly review of the support provided. Those who have Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans have a right to a review of their plan by the local authority at least annually.</p><p> </p><p>Schools have a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to make reasonable adjustments for students who are disabled, and to ensure that disabled students are not at a substantial disadvantage compared with their peers. This duty is anticipatory – it requires thought to be given in advance to what disabled students may require and what adjustments might be needed to prevent that disadvantage.</p><p>Students’ and parents’ views of services are an important part of the Ofsted CQC SEND inspections, which started in May 2016 and will see every local area inspected by 2021. Inspections look at the effectiveness of services, including education providers, in identifying and meeting needs and improving outcomes.</p><p> </p><p>It is important that education staff are well placed to support students with autism and specific learning difficulties. The department has funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2011 to deliver autism awareness training for early years, school and post-16 education staff. To date, the AET has provided training for more than 150,000 education staff. Training is available for all those who work in educational settings, not just teachers. The AET has also published national autism standards for educational settings and a competency framework for those working with children and young people with autism. A two-year extension to the contract with the AET was recently confirmed, worth £1.45 million.</p><p>In addition to work with the AET, the department works to ensure that all schools meet the needs of students with SEN and disabilities, including those with autism and specific learning difficulties, through Initial Teacher Training and the Teachers’ Standards. Each school, including Academies and Free Schools, must have a SEN co-ordinator (SENCO) who must hold qualified teacher status, and usually they must undertake the Masters level National Award in SEN co-ordination within three years of being appointed.</p><p> </p><p>The department is also funding the Education and Training Foundation in 2018-19 to improve the capacity of the Further Education sector to support students with SEND.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882608","Department for Education","false","2018-04-23","<p>The department continually reviews and improve systems and processes to oversee academies. We have strengthened our processes for monitoring the overall performance of MATs and ensuring growth is sustainable and delivers improvement. We have also improved support available, for example, through funding professional development programmes for MAT trustees[1] and funding Academy Ambassadors to match high calibre business leaders with academy trusts. Academy Ambassadors work closely with academy trusts and Regional Schools Commissioners to identify trust boards where additional business expertise would improve the governance of the trust and any skills or background that would be particularly desirable in light of the opportunities and challenges the trust is facing.</p><p> </p><p>The department has a robust system of financial accountability. Processes are founded on a clear framework communicated and regulated by the Education Skills and Funding Agency (ESFA), with effective oversight and compliance based on proportionate risk assessment, and robust intervention when things go wrong. ESFA scrutinises a broad range of academy trust data and intelligence to identify risk, including audited accounts and a number of annual financial returns.</p><p> </p><p>All academy trusts must publish details of their financial performance in annual accounts. To ensure strong external scrutiny, all academy trusts must have an annual external audit of their annual accounts by a registered statutory auditor and the department expect trusts to act on audit findings as an opportunity to strengthen their systems. The ESFA’s focus is much broader than intervention, working with the sector to continue building capacity and expertise in financial management and forecasting. To reinforce the importance of three year financial planning the ESFA are further strengthening budget forecasting, the ESFA CEO Eileen Milner wrote to academy trusts in March 2018 setting out the requirement for all academy trusts to submit three-year financial forecasts.</p><p> </p><p>Where concerns arise, ESFA works with trusts to prevent financial instability and enable them to recover their financial position and return to stable governance. Intervention is always proportionate, risk-based, and linked to non-compliance with requirements set out in the Academies Financial Handbook and academies’ funding agreements. The sector remains in a stable position, with just over 1% of academy trusts subject to an active Financial Notice to Improve.</p><p> </p><p>We constantly keep under review the financial control and reporting framework for academies and introduce any necessary enhancements through the Academies Financial Handbook and the Academies Accounts Direction, both of which are re-issued on an annual basis.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>[1] https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-governors-professional-development</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2018-04-23T16:55:36.177Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882608/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882608/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882608/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-04-13","Academies: Standards","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department has taken to improve the scrutiny of (a) finances and (b) academic performance at academies as a result of the collapse of the Wakefield City Academy Trust.","false","Biography information for Imran Hussain","Bradford East","Imran Hussain","135670"

The Government funds a number of programmes that improve the quality of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teaching in primary and secondary schools. These include the national network of Science Learning Partnerships, Project Enthuse bursaries, and the Stimulating Physics Network. The Department also funds Isaac Physics, which provides online support for A level physics students and their teachers.</p><p>The Department is following various avenues for raising awareness amongst children of the range of careers that science qualifications offer. This includes the STEM Ambassadors programme, a nationwide network of over 30,000 volunteers, drawn from a wide range of employers, who work with schools and non-school organisations across the UK.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2018-04-18T16:24:53.373Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882696/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882696/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/882696/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-04-13","Science: GCE A-level","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he is taking to increase the uptake of physics and chemistry at A-level.","false","Biography information for Mr Laurence Robertson","Tewkesbury","Mr Laurence Robertson","135758"

The Domestic Partnership Act passed in Bermuda in February 2018, removed the right to marry but replaced it with a provision for domestic partnerships with the same benefits as married couples. The Foreign Secretary has raised with the Premier of Bermuda his hope that the Domestic Partnership Act will be a stepping stone to putting same sex marriage on a statutory footing in the future.</p><p>The European Court of Human Rights has not, so far, interpreted the Convention to include a right to marry for same sex couples and has stopped short of finding a positive obligation generally to introduce protection equivalent to marriage. Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Montserrat and the Cayman Islands do not yet have in place legislation that provides for the recognition of same sex relationships whether by civil unions, civil partnerships or marriage. The new Governor of the Cayman Islands has publicly supported the introduction of civil unions and has urged the Premier and Leader of the Opposition to consider legislative change. There is a provision in the Cayman Islands' Constitution that provides that any person may apply to the Grand Court to determine compatibility with the Bill of Rights.</p><p>The European Convention on Human Rights applies to all the Overseas Territories. Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon raised the need to ensure that human rights obligations are upheld, in his meeting with the Premier of the Cayman Islands in October 2017, and with the Governments of all the Caribbean Overseas Territories at the Joint Ministerial Council in November 2017.
