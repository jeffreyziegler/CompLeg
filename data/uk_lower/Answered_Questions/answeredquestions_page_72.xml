The department supports schools to implement this requirement through a range of resources, such as those included on the Educate Against Hate website, as well as by working with networks of experts on the ground who provide direct support to schools on this. Every state-funded school, maintained and academy, must also teach religious education to all pupils up to the age of 18.</p><p> </p><p>Schools must comply with the requirements of the Equality Act and must also have a behaviour policy which includes measures to prevent bullying.

This includes funding the Anne Frank Trust to develop their ‘Free to Be’ debate programme, which encourages young people to think about the importance of tackling prejudice, discrimination and bullying.

We also fund the Holocaust Education Trust’s ‘Lessons from Auschwitz’ programme, which enables teachers and sixth form students to visit Auschwitz.</p><p>Schools can also address intolerance and bullying as part of non-statutory personal, social, health and economic education. We are also making relationships education compulsory in all primary schools and relationships and sex education compulsory in all secondary schools. We have completed a public consultation on draft guidance which is clear that pupils will be taught about the importance of building respectful relationships including, for example, understanding the impact of bullying and how stereotypes can be damaging.</p><p>Subject to making the regulations, schools will be required to teach these new subjects from September 2020, but they will be encouraged and supported to start teaching them from September 2019 on a voluntary basis.</p>","Guildford","Anne Milton",,"2019-02-13T16:22:42.943Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056712/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056712/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056712/answer","Guildford","Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056712/answer/previousversion/101439","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056712/answer/previousversion/101439",,,"60","Education","Education","2019-02-07","Schools: Antisemitism","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking within schools to tackle antisemitism.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","218172"

Since 2011, the MRC has funded seven research projects totalling £2.62 million, following a call for proposals to help increase the understanding of the mechanisms of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). CFS/ME research remains an area of high strategic importance for the MRC. Applications are encouraged in response to MRC’s Science Boards and Panels under a Cross-Board highlight notice, in place since 2003 and updated in 2011.</p><p> </p><p>On 20 September 2017, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced its decision to undertake a full update of the guideline, ‘Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy): Diagnosis and management of CFS/ME in adults and children’, following a review of the latest available evidence on the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME and a public consultation. New guidance is expected in October 2020. More information on this decision can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/news/article/nice-to-begin-review-of-its-guidance-on-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cfs-me" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/news/article/nice-to-begin-review-of-its-guidance-on-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cfs-me</a></p><p> </p><p>In terms of training, the General Medical Council sets out the knowledge, skills and behaviours that new United Kingdom medical graduates must be able to demonstrate and Royal Medical Colleges, such as the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) set the standards for postgraduate medical education in general practice. General practice is where most patients with CFS/ME are likely to be managed, and the condition is identified as a key area of clinical knowledge in the RCGP Applied Knowledge Test (AKT) content guide. The AKT is a summative assessment of the knowledge base that underpins general practice in the United Kingdom within the context of the NHS and is a key part of GPs’ qualifying exams.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, regarding concerns about the wellbeing of children; we recognise that chronic medical conditions, such as ME, can put a strain on the child and their family. Whilst the Department for Education would want to avoid action that would add to the strain, it is right that children’s services should be prepared to assess the needs of children who may be at risk. It is important that the assessment of a child is conducted on a multi-agency basis, and takes account of any medical condition the child may have.</p><p> </p><p>In July 2018, the Department for Education published an updated version of its statutory safeguarding guidance, ‘Working Together to Safeguard Children’.

DR schemes are contrived avoidance arrangements that pay loans in place of ordinary remuneration, with the sole purpose of avoiding income tax and National Insurance contributions.</p><p> </p><p>It is the view of HMRC and the Courts that these types of arrangements have never been effective and tax was always due. HMRC has consistently challenged their use and publicised the risks of trying to avoid tax. They have opened and settled thousands of enquiries into the use of DR schemes, and successfully litigated a number of cases in the courts. The most well-known judgement was the unanimous Supreme Court decision in favour of HMRC against Rangers Football Club.</p><p>HMRC is working hard to help individuals get out of tax avoidance for good and is encouraging anyone who is concerned about their ability to pay what they owe, to contact them as soon as possible to discuss their position. In November 2017, HMRC set up a dedicated helpline for those wanting to settle their avoidance scheme use, and discuss payment options. HMRC will work with all individuals to reach a manageable and sustainable payment plan wherever possible.</p><p> </p><p>Since the announcement of the 2019 loan charge at Budget 2016, HMRC has now agreed settlements on disguised remuneration schemes with employers and individuals totalling over £1 billion. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) liabilities fall on the employer in the first instance. The charge on DR loans does not change this principle and the employee will only be liable where the amount cannot reasonably be collected from the employer, such as where the employer is offshore or no longer exists. Around 85% of the settlement yield since 2016 is from employers, with less than 15% from individuals.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has also introduced a simplified process for those who choose to settle their use of DR avoidance schemes before the loan charge arises. DR scheme users who currently have an income of less than £50,000 and are no longer engaging in tax avoidance can automatically agree a payment plan of up to five years without the need to give HMRC any information about their income and assets. This arrangement has been extended to 7 years for scheme users who have an income of less than £30,000.</p>","Central Devon","Mel Stride",,"2019-02-14T17:25:02.813Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055782/answer","Biography information for Mel Stride","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055782/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055782/answer",,,,,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2019-02-06","Tax Avoidance","1","House of Commons","To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in relation to the Loan Charge 2019, whether Employment Benefit Trust schemes have always been considered defective by HMRC; and what the evidential basis is for the requirement to bring forward legislative proposals to enable HMRC to collect tax on loans issued since 1999.","false","Biography information for Mr Nigel Evans","Ribble Valley","Mr Nigel Evans","217479"

We have reduced pensioner poverty to close to historically low levels and the triple lock on the State Pension has helped lift the incomes of millions of pensioners. Since 2010, we have increased the annual level of the basic State Pension by £1,450. In 2018/19 we will spend £121.5 billion on benefits for pensioners and by 2023/24 this rises to £143.5 billion.</p><p> </p><p>In 2012, Parliament voted to modernise the welfare system to ensure that couples, where one person is of working age and the other person is over State Pension age, access support, where it is needed, through the working age benefit regime. This replaces the previous system whereby the household could access either Pension Credit and pension-age Housing Benefit, or working-age benefits.</p><p> </p><p>Pension Credit is designed to provide long-term support for pensioner households who are no longer economically active. It is not designed to support working age claimants. This change will ensure that the same work incentives apply to the younger partner as apply to other people of the same age, and taxpayer support is directed where it is needed most.</p><p> </p><p>The Government set out to Parliament last year that this change would be implemented once Universal Credit was available nationally for new claims. On 14th January 2019, the Government confirmed that this change will be introduced from 15th May 2019. The change was being brought into effect in Great Britain through a Commencement Order[1] under the Welfare Reform Act 2012.
