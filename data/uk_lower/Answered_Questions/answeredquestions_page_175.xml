Some of the examples of how we achieve this are as follows. We are the largest contributor to Education Cannot Wait, the first global movement aid fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. Through this, we target some of the world’s most vulnerable children, aiming to reach 3.4 million children through its first set of investments. We contribute funds to the No Lost Generation Initiative, a commitment by the international community to support children and youth affected by the Syria and Iraq crises, mainly in education and protection. In Somalia, we work with the UN and international NGOs to ensure the rights of children affected by conflict are addressed through family reunification, support to their nutrition needs and reducing the risks faced by displaced children.

By raising awareness and improving clinical practice we will save lives in the fight against this horrible illness. Better awareness has led to more cases of sepsis being detected across all age groups. We estimate that our cross system efforts since 2015 have saved over 1,000 lives but we know there is more to do and this is why a new action plan was launched in September 2017 to ensure the NHS is on the highest possible alert to tackle this silent killer.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Government office region</p></td><td><p>2012-13</p></td><td><p>2013-14</p></td><td><p>2014-15</p></td><td><p>2015-16</p></td><td><p>2016-17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>North East</p></td><td><p>4,743</p></td><td><p>5,259</p></td><td><p>6,324</p></td><td><p>8,630</p></td><td><p>11,588</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>North West</p></td><td><p>11,878</p></td><td><p>14,658</p></td><td><p>18,040</p></td><td><p>23,668</p></td><td><p>26,749</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yorkshire and Humber</p></td><td><p>8,299</p></td><td><p>9,749</p></td><td><p>10,972</p></td><td><p>13,380</p></td><td><p>15,188</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>East Midlands</p></td><td><p>8,086</p></td><td><p>9,203</p></td><td><p>11,261</p></td><td><p>12,625</p></td><td><p>14,181</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>West Midlands</p></td><td><p>8,636</p></td><td><p>10,281</p></td><td><p>12,052</p></td><td><p>13,996</p></td><td><p>15,761</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>East of England</p></td><td><p>9,598</p></td><td><p>11,154</p></td><td><p>13,908</p></td><td><p>17,214</p></td><td><p>20,208</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>London</p></td><td><p>12,382</p></td><td><p>15,110</p></td><td><p>16,682</p></td><td><p>19,053</p></td><td><p>22,052</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>South East</p></td><td><p>13,964</p></td><td><p>16,716</p></td><td><p>18,838</p></td><td><p>23,181</p></td><td><p>27,666</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>South West</p></td><td><p>8,547</p></td><td><p>9,870</p></td><td><p>11,754</p></td><td><p>12,995</p></td><td><p>15,016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Unknown/Outside of England</p></td><td><p>10,949</p></td><td><p>3,642</p></td><td><p>3,896</p></td><td><p>4,785</p></td><td><p>7,056</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total</p></td><td><p>97,082</p></td><td><p>105,642</p></td><td><p>123,727</p></td><td><p>149,527</p></td><td><p>175,465</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><ol><li>Source: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), NHS Digital.

For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely, apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information. It should be noted that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March, e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.</li></ol>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2018-02-20T16:12:18.907Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/839132/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/839132/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/839132/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-02-08","Sepsis","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many cases of sepsis there were in each region of England in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Jonathan Ashworth","Leicester South","Jonathan Ashworth","127691"
