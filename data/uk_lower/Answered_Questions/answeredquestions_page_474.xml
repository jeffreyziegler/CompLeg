The Summit also agreed a new “spearhead unit” within the NATO Response Force, which will be able to deploy at very short notice. At the Summit, the Prime Minister, my Rt. Hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr Cameron), announced that the UK offer would be a Battle Group and a Brigade HQ. In addition to this, the UK deployed RAF Typhoons to NATO’s standing peacetime Baltic Air Policing Mission in May 2014 and provided E3-D support and 3500 troops for exercises in Eastern Europe before the end of 2015. These actions demonstrate the UK‘s continuing commitment to our eastern Allies, including the Baltic States, as we safeguard the freedom and security of all Allies by political and military means.

Under the 1986 Act there is a statutory requirement for scrutiny by, in the first instance, the Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body at the Establishment where the work will be performed, and then an assessment is made by the Home Office Inspectorate. The Animals in Science Committee may also be asked for advice on specific applications.<br><br>The Inspector’s assessment of an application will include a rigorous harm / benefit analysis which requires access to all of the information in an <br>application. This will take into consideration discussions held with the applicant and knowledge of the establishment where the work will take place. <br>Inspectors use criteria such as the proposed scientific methodology, the resources available to the applicant and their track record with regard to <br>publications and animal use, to determine how likely the benefits are to be delivered.

The Public Guardian can also refer cases to health and care authorities, who can act under statutory safeguarding powers to protect an individual who may be at risk, and to the police if he suspects a criminal offence has been committed.</p><p>Anyone who suspects that someone acting under a registered power of attorney is abusing that position should report any suspicion of abuse immediately to the Office of the Public Guardian by:</p><p>Email <a href="mailto:OPG.Safeguardingunit@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk" target="_blank">OPG.Safeguardingunit@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk</a>. or</p><p>Telephone: 0300 456 0300</p><p>A power of attorney is a private arrangement where the donor chooses who they wish to appoint and therefore the Government feels that State intervention in this process should be limited.

There might also be an increase in the cost of registering a power to cover the Court cost, which may lead to people not making LPAs, and therefore not being able to make provision for the future.</p><p>Under sections 22 and 23 of the Mental Capacity Act, the Court of Protection has wide-ranging powers to decide on issues relating to the operation or validity of an LPA.</p>","Bermondsey and Old Southwark","Simon Hughes","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/92686/answer",,,,,"209849 ; 209850 ; 209861","2014-10-20T12:13:04.7405229Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/92686/answer","Biography information for Simon Hughes","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/92686/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-10-10","Powers of Attorney","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what safeguards are in place to prevent misuse of funds when a (a) single and (b) joint power of attorney is obtained.","false","Biography information for Jon Trickett","Hemsworth","Jon Trickett","209854"

However, I can assure the hon. Member that the Government is fully committed to ensuring that all young people, including those from the most disadvantaged families, can continue to participate in further education and training after they leave school. We are investing over £7 billion to fund a place at school or college for every 16- or 17-year-old who wants one. We recognise that some young people need additional help with the costs associated with attending further education or training, and we offer a range of financial support, which is set out here:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/education/student-finance" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/browse/education/student-finance</a></p><p>The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is a key part of our participation strategy to support young people in education and training. It allows schools and colleges to target financial support towards those who need it most. They are free to establish their own eligibility criteria for payments from the Bursary Fund, because they are best placed to identify those students experiencing the greatest financial disadvantages or course-related costs; and because they have the best knowledge of local circumstances and the individual barriers that can prevent young people from participating.</p><p>Feedback gained from institutions and students indicates that the scheme is achieving its aims. The majority of institutions surveyed think the Bursary Fund is having a positive impact on young people’s participation (77%) and engagement in learning (70%). Similarly, more than three-quarters (78%) think it is effective in targeting young people facing the greatest barriers to participation.</p><p>Students have also confirmed their support for the Bursary Fund with the majority of recipients surveyed saying it allows them to cope better (75%), and a third of those saying it is integral to being able to continue in education.</p><p>School and academy sixth forms already have to provide free meals to disadvantaged students who are over 16. From September 2014, free meals will also be available to disadvantaged students taking further education (FE) courses across the whole FE sector, which will provide further support for families. It will also help students with their studies as we know that they perform better when they have access to good-quality, regular meals.</p><p>The support I have outlined above is part of a range of measures implemented by the Department for Education that have contributed to achieving the lowest levels of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) since records began in 1994. This is important because the effects of being NEET are recognised as having a significant financial cost for the families of young people.</p>","Grantham and Stamford","Nick Boles","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/91956/answer",,,,,,"2014-10-14T15:08:12.8711065Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/91956/answer","Biography information for Nick Boles","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/91956/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-09-26","Education: Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what estimate she has made of the average cost to a family of supporting a young person aged 16 to 18 in full-time education or training.","false","Biography information for Rushanara Ali","Bethnal Green and Bow","Rushanara Ali","209382"

We continue to engage with the Cuban government to strengthen bilateral relations and promote reform. This includes support for recent economic changes such as a new foreign investment law, and by raising human rights concerns where appropriate.</p><p>The UK and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) have had formal bilateral relations since December 2000. Since then, the UK has concentrated on two main foreign policy areas: counter-proliferation and human rights. Our policy of “critical engagement” is intended to promote incremental change: it allows us directly to communicate issues of substantial concern, and focuses on exposing people in North Korea to international values and the benefits of engaging with the international community. Our Embassy in Pyongyang helps to improve our understanding of what is happening inside the country, as well as providing support for small-scale projects aimed at improving the lives of the most vulnerable in DPRK society.</p><p>The UK and Venezuela have a constructive and practical relationship and engage in cooperation in areas of mutual interest: our counternarcotics cooperation is vital in tackling illegal drugs trafficking; we are engaging closely ahead of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations; and our trade links support economic development in both countries, particularly in the oil sector. We have been following the political situation in Venezuela closely and were deeply saddened by the deaths that occurred in protests earlier this year. The British Government called on all sides to reduce tension and take steps to promote political reconciliation through genuine dialogue.</p><p>The UK has endeavoured over the past 23 years to build a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Russia, to support its integration into the international community and international rules-based system. By its illegal annexation of Crimea, and its aggressive destabilisation of south eastern Ukraine, the Russian leadership has rejected that offer of partnership and instead chosen a path of confrontation. We deeply regret this. Moscow needs to understand that military aggression, destabilisation of a sovereign neighbour, and flouting of international commitments have serious consequences. So whilst we need to maintain a relationship with Russia that enables dialogue and ongoing co-operation on high priority global issues, it cannot be business-as-usual. The UK hopes that the Russian leadership will take the necessary steps to help secure a lasting peace in eastern Ukraine that restores respect for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity and enables Russia to return to a constructive relationship with the rest of the world.</p><p>Following the attack on our Embassy in Iran on 29 November 2011, diplomatic relations with Iran were reduced to their lowest level possible, but were not completely severed. Over the past year, we have been seeking to improve UK/Iran relations on a step-by-step and reciprocal basis. Most recently, My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister met President Rouhani on 24 September in the margins of the UN General Assembly - the first such meeting since the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/92039","Ministry of Justice","false","2014-10-17","<p /> <p>The deployment of staff between prisons on detached duty is a regular and normal part of prison resourcing. It allows staff to be allocated from prisons with the capacity to provide them, to those where additional staffing is required. On average over the six month period (January to June 2014), less than 1% of Band 3 officers were provided on detached duty. A large proportion of the capacity is typically available from prisons that are in the process of closure or going through a re-role. This process temporarily releases a number of officers who are not supplied for specific occasions but are sent and received on a shift pattern throughout the week.</p><p> </p><p>The number of staff available for detached duty at any one time is a matter for operational judgement and takes account of overall staff numbers, levels of sickness, prisoner numbers and the regime and security requirements.</p><p> </p><p>The average weekly provision of band 3 prison officers, that were received as part of the nationally co-ordinated detached duty scheme, are shown in the tables below for April to June 2014. For information on the three months January to March I refer the Hon. Member to the reply given to him on 12 June 2014, Official Report, columns 316W to 318W. The nationally co-ordinated scheme relates to Band 3 Prison Officers only.
