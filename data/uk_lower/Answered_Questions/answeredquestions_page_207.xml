Data preceding 2010 is drawn from the Child Protection and Referrals 3 (CPR3) statistical return.</p><p> </p><p>The number of children subject of a child protection plan (CPP) has been rising over the recent years, a pattern that has continued through the collection of data from both sources. However, whilst it is likely there was an increase between 2008-09 and 2009-10, due to the differences in the data sources, it is not possible to confirm if the increase was solely down to an increase in the number of children subject to a CPP, or partially explained by the change in data source.</p><p> </p><p>Since 2010 there has been a consistent increase in the number of section 47 enquiries, from 89,300 to 185,450. These are the enquiries initiated to decide whether and what type of action is required to safeguard and promote the welfare of a child who is suspected of, or likely to be, suffering significant harm.</p><p> </p><p>There has also been an increase in the number of initial stage child protection conferences since 2010, from 43,900 to 76,930. These are the meetings which bring together family members (and the child, where appropriate), with advocates and professionals, to make decisions about the child’s safety, health and development. Over the same period, the number of children who are then subject to a CPP has also increased, but at a lower rate, from 39,100 to 51,080.</p><p> </p><p>In recording the reason a child becomes subject to a CPP, since 2010, there has been an increase in the proportion of plans recorded under the initial categories of neglect and emotional abuse. Conversely, the proportion of plans under the categories of physical abuse and multiple forms of abuse have fallen.</p><p> </p><p>Wherever local councils have reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm, they are under a duty to investigate. It is right that where local councils have concerns about a child, they undertake an assessment to determine what action is appropriate to take. As well as indicating some change in the categories of abuse under which social workers are recording CPPs, these trends indicate that local councils are undertaking more investigative action now than in 2010 – with an increasing number of children then going onto CPPs.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/789904/answer",,,,,,"2017-11-29T16:35:49.533Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/789904/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/789904/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2017-11-15","Children: Protection","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government in the light of their Children in need and child protection statistics, for 2006–07 and 2016–17, showing an increase in the number of children who were the subject of a child protection plan in place at year end from 27,900 to 51,080, what assessment they have made of the factors leading to that increase.","false","Biography information for Lord Porter of Spalding",,"Lord Porter of Spalding","HL3288"

On 16 November I chaired a meeting with the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) and several of their members to explore the issues and opportunities in this area. This was attended by the trade body UK Finance, finance providers, the British Business Bank, the Homes and Communities Agency and representatives from HM Treasury and the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p><p> </p><p>Smaller housebuilders have a vital role to play in increasing both the quantity and diversity of housing supply. The most recent FMB survey shows that access to finance ranks second in the list of their members’ concerns (after land availability and ahead of planning) with 54% of members reporting that a lack of finance constrained their ability to build more homes. The Government is working with private-sector funders to support the sector in a number of ways. For example, the British Business Bank has recently (31 October) agreed an ENABLE guarantee with United Trust Bank. This deal is expected to unlock new investment of at least £500m by increasing the bank’s capacity to lend.</p><p> </p><p>The Homes and Communities Agency updated the meeting on progress with the Home Building Fund, which is on track to exceed its target of 25,000 new housing starts by advancing finance to smaller housebuilders on projects that do not meet the criteria for bank lending. There was also an update on the Housing Growth Partnership, a £100m fund set up in collaboration between the Government and Lloyds Banking Group, which invests directly alongside smaller housebuilders offering investments in the range of £0.5 million to £5 million for each project.</p><p> </p><p>These three examples of a loan guarantee, direct lending and equity investment illustrate themes that were agreed by all those attending the meeting: designing finance products that work for smaller housebuilders; maintaining the diversity of finance providers as well as types of finance; and collaboration between the public and private sectors.</p>","Stourbridge","Margot James","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/790238/answer",,,,,,"2017-11-23T11:51:06.607Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/790238/answer","Biography information for Margot James","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/790238/answer",,,,,"201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2017-11-15","Housing: Construction","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, pursuant to the Answer of 14 November 2017 to Question 111705, what discussions he has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the level of financial support for small and medium-sized enterprise homebuilders.","false","Biography information for Bill Esterson","Sefton Central","Bill Esterson","113372"

A new contract for family services was awarded across the female estate, excluding HMP Styal who elected to undertake a separate regional procurement exercise for family services, in October 2017. The new contract allows women’s prisons to work closely with a single professional family services provider to develop innovative services including those to support children visiting imprisoned mothers. There are statutory minimum prison visit entitlements and standards that prisons must meet for visiting families, including children. Prison Rules also require Governors to encourage and promote family ties. Women’s prisons are working to provide other support, beyond the statutory minimum, for improved family links. This includes family days, child-centred visits, homework clubs and specific relationship and parenting skills programmes. Family days can involve contributions from education providers, voluntary and third-sector agencies to support organised activities with the prisoners and their children. If they require it, families of female offenders can seek financial support for visits. The assisted prison visits scheme promotes family ties by contributing to the costs of prison visits by providing help with travel expenses to prisoners’ close relatives, a partner or a friend (if classed as a sole visitor) who meet the qualifying rules on income. Children (under 18 years old) are included, providing that their responsible guardian is in receipt of a qualifying low income benefit on behalf of the child and is able to escort the child to the prison.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",,"Lord Keen of Elie","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/788886/answer",,,,,,"2017-11-24T12:26:29.393Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/788886/answer","Biography information for Lord Keen of Elie","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/788886/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-11-14","Prisoners: Mothers","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what provision is made for children aged under 18 whose mothers have been imprisoned to visit their mothers.","false","Biography information for Baroness Fall",,"Baroness Fall","HL3195"
