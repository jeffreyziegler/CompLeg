We committed in the Victims Strategy published last year to review the process for informing victims of offenders’ sentences and what they mean and we are currently consulting on proposals for revising the code, which will be followed by a consultation on a draft revised code.</p><p> </p><p>The statutory National Probation Service Victim Contact Scheme is available to victims of violent and sexual offences, where the offender receives a sentence of 12 months or more. The Scheme provides victims with information and advice about the criminal justice process – including explaining the sentence to them and ensuring that they are informed of the offender’s release.</p><p> </p><p>In such cases, victims also have the statutory right to request conditions that can be attached to the offender's release licence. These can include a no contact condition, and an exclusion zone covering areas where the victim lives, works, or travels too frequently. The offender risks being recalled to prison should they breach any of their licence conditions.</p><p> </p><p>Offenders who have committed an eligible sexual or violent offence and sentenced to 12 months or more imprisonment will be managed under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Under MAPPA, the Prison, Probation and Police Services are required to work together to assess and manage the risks presented by such offenders. Thus, the MAPPA plan for managing the risk to such offenders must include measures to protect previous victims from further harm.</p><p> </p><p>Additionally, Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs) develop strategies to help and protect domestic abuse victims at high risk of murder or serious harm. Agencies including the Police, providers of probation services, health and child protection, as well as Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, share information and develop actions to protect the victim.</p><p> </p><p>In respect of appealing sentencing decisions, the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme enables anyone, including victims, the ability to ask the Attorney General to consider referring sentences for certain offences which he believes to be unduly lenient, to the Court of Appeal. The offences covered by the scheme are indictable only offences that are heard in the Crown Court, and certain triable either way offences when heard in the Crown Court. The scheme has a statutory 28-day time limit for referrals to be made. The scheme ensures there is a route for victims, their families, and the public, to question sentences imposed by the court for certain cases.</p><p> </p><p>If a case is referred, it will be a matter for the Court of Appeal to determine whether the sentence should remain as it is, be increased, or whether guidance should be issued for future cases.</p><p> </p>",,"Lord Keen of Elie","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144105/answer",,,,,,"2019-09-09T16:34:20.913Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144105/answer","Biography information for Lord Keen of Elie","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144105/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-09-03","Domestic Abuse: Sentencing","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to ensure that victims of domestic violence, following the sentencing of an offender, receive (1) the precise sentence outcome, (2) accurate and relevant information about the possible impact of a sentence, and (3) the date of an offenders bail and prison release, to ensure that safeguarding mechanisms can be put in place; and what plans they have to enable victims of such violence to appeal sentencing decisions.","false","Biography information for Baroness Brady",,"Baroness Brady","HL17593"

Ministers will correspond directly with the Member.</del></p><p><ins class="ministerial">Under the Geneva Conventions, States Parties must enact legislation to provide effective penal sanctions for those that commit, or order to be committed, grave breaches of the Conventions. States Parties must also search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of the Conventions, and ensure that they may be prosecuted before their courts, regardless of their nationality, or extradited, as appropriate. For the UK, the domestic criminal framework has been in place since the Geneva Conventions Act 1957. The UK works closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross and in particular with the British Red Cross to promote compliance with the Geneva Conventions and International Humanitarian Law (IHL).</ins></p><p><ins class="ministerial">When there are allegations of violations of the Geneva Conventions around the world, we have actively influenced decisions in the international arena to take action against perpetrators and to hold them to account. Our leading role in establishing and supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia are examples where grave breaches of the Conventions were proven and persons held accountable. The UK also supports the work of the International Criminal Court, which investigates and prosecutes individuals within its jurisdiction alleged to have committed the gravest crimes of concern to the international community.</ins></p><p><ins class="ministerial">More recently The UK has repeatedly called on the Syrian regime to abide by the Conventions and has taken a leading role to hold Syria to account. Since 2016, we have committed almost £1 million to the UN International Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to support the preparation of legal cases for serious crimes committed in the Syrian conflict. Following UK-led lobbying, on 1 August the UN Secretary General announced a new Board of Inquiry to investigate attacks on civilian infrastructure during the recent violence in Northwest Syria.</ins></p><p><ins class="ministerial">The Geneva Conventions are cornerstones of IHL but contemporary conflict brings challenges for IHL in a number of areas, such as new technologies and the classification of conflicts. To examine these challenges and to mark 70 years of the Conventions, the UK with the strong support of the British Red Cross, will hold an expert conference in October 2019.</ins></p>",,"Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144117/answer",,,,,,"2019-09-09T16:30:40.493Z","2019-10-01T10:59:32.703Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144117/answer","Biography information for Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144117/answer",,"Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144117/answer/previousversion/133905","Biography information for Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2019-09-03","Geneva Conventions","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of how violations of the Geneva Convention should be addressed; and whether any such assessment includes provision for the handling of erring Parties.","false","Biography information for Baroness Cox",,"Baroness Cox","HL17605"

A provider may subsequently seek to challenge the decision through judicial review.</p><p> </p><p>While the OfS took on some of the responsibilities of the Higher Education Funding Council for England following its closure, the OfS was set up as a new organisation with a new remit and responsibilities. The OfS regulatory framework and its guidance to providers sets out how applications for registration are assessed. The department is unable to comment on individual cases related to the OfS registration process. Neither the department nor our ministers can intervene in judicial reviews of the decisions of the OfS.</p><p> </p><p>The OfS considers the impact on both current and prospective students before taking registration decisions. A decision to refuse is not taken lightly, but HERA is clear that a provider which does not meet the OfS initial conditions of registration must be refused. Circumstances for current students will vary at different providers. However, the OfS will always seek to work with the provider to ensure that students are supported to complete their studies – either at their current provider where existing students can continue to access student support for the purposes of teach out, or at a new provider. Higher education providers should have systems and policies in place to offer appropriate mental health support and signposting to specialist help where necessary.</p>",,"Baroness Berridge","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144151/answer",,,,,"HL17637 ; HL17638","2019-09-09T16:50:13.04Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144151/answer","Biography information for Baroness Berridge","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144151/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-09-03","Higher Education: Registration","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what provisions and alternative finance arrangements are being put in place to support students who have been affected by the Office for Student's decision to refuse registration of their educational institutions; and what assessment they have made of the impact of such refusals on student mental health.","false","Biography information for Lord Hunt of Kings Heath",,"Lord Hunt of Kings Heath","HL17639"

The problem is alignment between weekly and monthly cycles. Each month the UC housing element is a constant figure but claimants with weekly tenancy agreements will be required to make either four or five rent payments within this period. If the claimant always pays their rent on time, in five payment months they are effectively making payment for part of the following month. That month will always be a four rent payment month, so the combination of the advance payment and the ‘overpayment’ of housing support during that month will get the claimant back on track.</p><p>Where a landlord charges rent weekly on a Monday, because of the way the calendar falls every 5 or 6 years, they will seek 53 rent payments in a year, with the 53rd payment in part covering the tenancy for the first few days of the following year. The effect of this is that, over the course of the next housing association rental year, a tenant’s UC payments will accurately reflect their liability, irrespective of the 53 payment weeks.</p><p>There is a separate issue with respect to the way the calculation in the Universal Credit regulations converts a weekly liability into a monthly allowance. The conversion is achieved by multiplying the weekly rent by 52 and then dividing by 12. This effectively means one day’s rent a year (two days in a leap years) are not covered by UC. We are currently considering whether this formulation around weekly rents, and potentially other weekly amounts in the UC calculation, should be amended.</p>","Colchester","Will Quince","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144346/answer",,,,,,"2019-09-09T12:45:52.383Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144346/answer","Biography information for Will Quince","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1144346/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2019-09-03","Universal Credit: Payments","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether her Department plans to recalculate universal credit payments to take account of recipients who are required to make 53 rent payments in a year.","false","Biography information for Graham P Jones","Hyndburn","Graham P Jones","286189"
