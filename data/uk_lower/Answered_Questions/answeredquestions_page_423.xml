The CQC highlighted that staff attitudes were not always helpful, particularly where people were repeatedly presenting in crisis with self-harm, and that this has implications for risks of self-harm when people are not seen quickly or compassionately enough to stop crises from escalating.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have increased investment in mental health. Spending on mental health was estimated to increase by £302 million in 2014/15, with total mental health spending rising from £11.362 billion in 2013/14 to £11.664 billion planned in 2014/15, an increase of 0.6% in real terms.

Latest statistics are published in the statistical first release 'Outcomes for children looked after by local authorities': <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/outcomes-for-children-looked-after-by-local-authorities" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/outcomes-for-children-looked-after-by-local-authorities</a>. It is not possible to attribute these improvements to single factors such as data collection improvements.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The department, working with its key users and interested parties, is regularly making improvements to the annual looked after children data collection from local authorities. Through our work to provide timely and relevant transparency information, the department is striving to help drive local and national improvement in the outcomes for looked after children. For example, in 2014, for the first time, information was collected on the activity and accommodation of care leavers aged 19, 20 and 21 (previously it was just 19-year-olds), which enables a fuller understanding of the numbers of young people who are not in education, employment or training when they leave care. In 2016, in order to help understand the causes of placement instability, the department will begin to collect data on the reason for placement moves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve the quality of care. The department has taken steps to streamline and strengthen the assessment and approval for foster carers and improve their recruitment and retention. The department has also taken steps to encourage social workers to give foster carers a more active role in day-to-day decisions. New qualifications requirements have been introduced to improve the level of skills for care workers and children’s homes. In April 2015, new quality standards regulations were introduced in order to improve the experience of children in residential care. These new quality standards can be found online here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/355577/Guide_to_the_children_s_homes_regulations.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/355577/Guide_to_the_children_s_homes_regulations.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The department has invested £36 million over the last four years in developing, testing and embedding evidence based interventions for looked-after children and those on the edge of care or custody. Long-term foster care as a distinct placement type was introduced in April 2015 to ensure that long-term arrangements are planned, stable and made in the best interests of the child.

Launched in June 2014, the AMR initiative will coordinate the work of medical researchers, biologists, engineers, vets, economists, social scientists, mathematicians and even designers, in a multi-pronged approach to address all aspects of the multi-faceted problem, drawing together a range of scientific expertise from the UK and abroad.</p><p>In addition, the MRC established the AMR Funders’ Forum to encourage a coordinated approach to funding research. It brings together the Research Councils with health departments, government bodies and charities that either provide support for AMR research or have an interest in AMR.

Good mental health is one of the four positive outcomes for all children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) that are at the heart of the recent SEND reforms.

In April 2012 the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) gave its support for a pilot to assess the value of using human papilloma virus (HPV) as primary screening for cervical disease, rather than the currently used cytology test. The pilot is establishing the feasibility of using HPV as the primary screen for cervical disease in order to achieve better outcomes for women, while minimising over-treatment and anxiety, and whether it is practical to roll out nationally. The pilot sites, which began in May 2013, are: Liverpool, Manchester, Northwick Park (Harrow), Bristol, Sheffield and Norwich. An absence of HPV means that the woman’s risk of developing cervical cancer is very low. Strategies in which HPV was used as the first test (primary screen) were found to be both cost and life years saving. Cancer Research UK has estimated that, when fully implemented, HPV as primary screening could prevent an additional 600 cancers a year<sup>1</sup> . The UK NSC will open a public consultation shortly on whether HPV as primary screening for cervical disease should replace the currently used cytology test.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer (ACCS) met earlier this year and were given a presentation on whether self-sampling would be a feasible method in cervical screening. The ACCS acknowledged that various United Kingdom studies demonstrated an increase in uptake amongst non-attendees when self-sampling was offered. The ACCS agreed that self-sampling was a feasible strategy for HPV testing. However, further work would need to be undertaken before this could be piloted.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department funds the Policy Research Unit in Cancer Awareness, Screening and Early Diagnosis led by the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London.

This includes two weeks officers spend in their prison, an induction week and a week of prison based learning. The training provides new officers with a foundation level of training in all core skill areas including interpersonal skills, mental health awareness, equality, violence reduction and safer custody, alongside the more traditional security awareness and practical skills needed to be a prison officer.</p><p> </p><p>In recognition of the complexity of the role of a prison officer, NOMS plans to increase initial training to twelve weeks. Newly recruited officers will spend 10 weeks at a NOMS learning centre and 2 weeks at their designated prison. This revised course will have an expanded content in relation to safer custody and mental health issues, and there will be a bespoke supporting qualification aimed to prepare new entrant officers to deliver in a rehabilitative culture. There will be more emphasis on building stronger staff-prisoner relationships, with prison officers acting as motivating role models and positively reinforcing values, attitudes and behaviours in order to change their lives.</p><p> </p><p>NOMS attaches great importance to the continuing professional development of prison officers, and the range of learning and development opportunities available to staff supports this.

Israeli restrictions damage the economy and living standards of ordinary people in Gaza. Israel’s lifting of certain restrictions has resulted in some limited improvements in living standards in Gaza compared to the situation in the immediate aftermath of last summer’s conflict. The water supply has been doubled, more agricultural produce is leaving Gaza for export to Israel or transfer to the West Bank, and the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism is facilitating repairs.
