The UK has made no formal assessment of the impact of other countries’ additional measures to restrict trade in ivory. However, as a further step in delivering the Government’s manifesto commitment to press for a total ban on ivory sales, on 21 September the Secretary of State announced plans for a ban on sales of items containing ivory dated between 1947 and the present day, putting UK rules on ivory sales among the world’s toughest. We will consult on plans for the ban early next year. This will complement the existing UK approach not to permit the trade of raw ivory tusks.</p><p> </p><p>The Government also successfully lobbied for the EU-wide adoption of the existing UK ban on sales of raw ivory tusks, which was advocated through the EU Council Conclusions on an EU Action Plan on Wildlife Trafficking and adopted in June. This urged EU Member States not to issue export or re-export documents under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) for raw, pre-Convention ivory (pre-1990) and to consider further measures to put a halt to commercial trade in ivory from elephants.</p><p> </p><p>At the CITES Conference that took place from 24 September to 5 October the UK was involved in negotiations that successfully secured a strong agreement calling for the closure of domestic ivory markets where they contribute to poaching or illegal trade.

The only way to secure an investigation by the ICC would be for the UN Security Council (UNSC) to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC. This would require a UNSC resolution. Russia and China vetoed a UNSC resolution which proposed referring all those responsible for war-crimes and crimes against humanity, regardless of affiliation, to the ICC in May 2014.

This service specification has been developed by specialised clinicians, commissioners, expert patients and public health representatives to describe core and developmental service standards.</p><p>The full service specification can be found at:</p><p><a href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/a02-cncr-panc.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/a02-cncr-panc.pdf</a></p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published updated guideline, <em>Suspected cancer: recognition and referral</em>, in June 2015, to ensure that it reflects latest evidence and can continue to support general practitioners (GPs) to identify patients, including children and young people and urgently refer them as appropriate. NICE noted that 5,000 more lives could be saved each year in England if GPs followed the new guideline, which encourage GPs to think of cancer sooner and lower the referral threshold.</p>","Warrington South","David Mowat",,"2016-10-17T16:17:50.467Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/595738/answer","Biography information for David Mowat","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/595738/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/595738/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-10-07","Pancreatic Cancer: Mortality Rates","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he is taking to reduce mortality rates for people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.","false","Biography information for Carol Monaghan","Glasgow North West","Carol Monaghan","47270"

The guidelines advise that:</p><p>- “injectable opioid treatment may be suitable for a small minority of patients who have failed in optimised oral treatment.”;</p><p>- “clinicians providing injectable opioid treatment should encourage patients not to regard it as a lifelong treatment option and should regularly review their patients and the continuing necessity for this unusual and expensive treatment”; and</p><p>- The use of diamorphine “alone does not constitute drug treatment…it should be seen as on element or pathway within wider packages of planned and integrated drug treatment”.</p><p>The guidelines are currently being reviewed by an Expert Working Group, to take into account developments in the evidence base.
