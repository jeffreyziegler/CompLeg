In 2016/17 over 150,000 pupils in England entered a Design and Technology (D&amp;T) GCSE at the end of Key Stage 4, which is over 25% of all pupils.[1]</p><p> </p><p>Subject experts identified a number of issues with the previous suite of D&amp;T GCSEs. They advised that the GCSEs were out of date, did not reflect current industry practice, and lacked sufficient science, technology, engineering and mathematics content. These issues could have had an effect on take up. One issue was that there were six separate GCSEs focusing on different materials (such as resistant materials and textiles) or particular aspects of D&amp;T (such as product design and systems and control). These did not allow pupils to gain a broad knowledge of the design process, materials, techniques and equipment that are core to the subject. The Department has reformed the D&amp;T GCSE to address these issues. There is now just one GCSE title which emphasises the iterative design processes that is at the core of contemporary practice and includes more about cutting edge technology and processes. The new GCSE now effectively provides pupils with the knowledge they need to progress to further study and careers, including in high-tech industries.</p><p> </p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/revised-gcse-and-equivalent-results-in-england-2016-to-2017" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/revised-gcse-and-equivalent-results-in-england-2016-to-2017</a>.</p><p> </p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2018-06-19T15:50:00.177Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/921939/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/921939/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/921939/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-06-11","Design and Technology: GCSE","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what information he holds on the reasons for the decline in the number of entries to Design and Technology GCSE since 2010.","false","Biography information for Robert Halfon","Harlow","Robert Halfon","152125"

As part of their Better Care Fund plans, all areas are expected to implement the High Impact Change model to support system-wide improvement in discharging patients. This model includes a ‘home first’ approach which supports timely discharge and the delivery of health and care closer to home.</p><p> </p><p>We are also increasing capacity in the community so that more people can receive care in their own homes. To date, the NHS has boosted clinical capacity and capability of NHS 111, which now takes 16 million calls each year, with more than 50% of callers receiving clinical input in April this year. The NHS has also expanded ‘Hear and Treat’ and ‘See and Treat’ ambulance services so that they now cover 3.5 million people, with the provision of telephone advice and treatment of people in their homes saving needless trips to hospital.</p><p> </p><p>We want people to be able to live in their own home for as long as possible. The Department funds the Disabled Facilities Grant to support older and disabled people on low-incomes to adapt their homes to make them suitable for their needs.
