We are investing £450 million to achieve early diagnosis of cancer through better public awareness, better screening and better access to key diagnostic tests.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer (2005) are available to help general practitioners (GPs) assess when it is appropriate to refer patients for suspected cancer, including prostate cancer. NICE is in the process of updating the guidelines to ensure that these reflect latest evidence and can continue to support GPs to identify patients with suspected cancer symptoms and urgently refer them as appropriate. NICE’s anticipated publication date for the revised guidelines is May 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At a local level, it is for individual clinical commissioning groups to promote and enhance the diagnostic capability to deliver better outcomes. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments that may be used for prostate cancer are commissioned at the moment by NHS England. NHS England’s prostate cancer service specification clearly defines what it expects to be in place for providers to offer evidence-based, safe and effective prostate cancer services. This service specification has been developed by specialised clinicians, commissioners, expert patients and public health representatives to describe core and developmental service standards.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NICE published an updated clinical guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in January 2014. NICE has recommended docetaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide as treatment options for some types of prostate cancer, subject to certain clinical criteria and is currently appraising a number of other prostate cancer drugs. Patients have the right to drugs and treatments that have been recommended by NICE technology appraisal guidance for use in the National Health Service, where their doctor believes they are clinically appropriate. A number of drugs to treat prostate cancer are available through the Cancer Drugs Fund.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This Government is also investing in innovative radiotherapy treatments to improve outcomes for those with cancer. NHS England has also committed to make up to £6 million available over the next three years to support six trials by Cancer Research UK into the use of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). This will allow patients to receive SABR treatment now, where clinicians think they could benefit. At the same time doctors can fully assess the effectiveness of these treatments so that in future, if it proves to be effective, they will be available for all relevant patients on the NHS. Two of these six trials will be on prostate cancer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have also invested £23 million across 50 United Kingdom centres aimed at increasing the capacity of radiotherapy centres in England to deliver Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT). We committed to achieving the ambition of 24% of all radiotherapy to be delivered through more accurate IMRT, and we are now seeing 35% of all radical radiotherapy treatments delivered using this method compared to 5% in 2010.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA) began collecting data in April 2014 and is due to publish the first of four annual reports during November 2014. The NPCA is the first national clinical audit of the care that men receive following a diagnosis of prostate cancer. It is designed to collect information about the diagnosis, management and treatment of every patient newly diagnosed with prostate cancer in England and Wales, and their outcomes. The findings from the audit will contribute to changes in clinical practice ensuring that patients receive the best care possible and experience an improved quality of life.

The provisions include implementing a penalty for those landlords who rent property to immigrants without leave in the UK, denying free access to most secondary healthcare in the UK to illegal immigrants, requiring banks to check against a database of known immigration offenders before opening accounts, introducing new powers to check the immigration status of applicants before issuing a driving licence and revoking the driving licences of those migrants who have overstayed, and introducing new powers to clamp down <br>on those trying to gain immigration advantage by entering into a sham marriage or civil partnership. <br><br>We have also used the Immigration Act to streamline the process of enforcing the removal of illegal migrants when necessary.

The EYFS seeks to provide quality and consistency in all early years settings, so that every child makes good progress, attainment gaps are reduced and no child gets left behind. The EYFS specifies areas in which early years providers must support children to develop, including literacy and numeracy. It is the responsibility of early years providers to identify and meet the learning and development needs of the children attending their setting. The EYFS requires providers to carry out ongoing assessment of children’s development and needs and should address any learning and development needs in partnership with parents and/or carers, and any relevant professionals.</p><p> </p><p>The Department for Education is increasing the level of required English and maths qualifications for members of the early years workforce. This will ensure that all those working with young children have the right skills to support all children to achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy.</p><p> </p><p>1. We have published guidance on Teacher’s Standards (Early Years) which includes a requirement for Early Years Teachers to demonstrate a clear understanding of synthetic phonics and strategies for teaching early mathematics. The standards also require Early Years Teachers to plan and adapt education to cater for the needs of individual children, to make accurate assessments to inform children’s learning and development and to promote equality of opportunity and anti-discriminatory practice.</p><p> </p><p>2. Early Years Teachers must pass the same professional skills tests as trainee school teachers and must have GCSE English and maths at grade C or above on entry to training courses.</p><p> </p><p>3. NCTL published new, more robust, criteria for level 3 qualifications in July 2013 – the “Early Years Educator” criteria. They set out the minimum requirements for the knowledge, understanding and skills which learners must demonstrate during assessment for their qualification to be considered qualified at level 3. The criteria include a requirement for qualifications to include a focus on recognising and meeting the individual learning and development needs of children.</p><p> </p><p>4. From 1 August 2014, Government funding of Level 3 Early Years Educator training courses through the Skills Funding Agency will require trainees to have GCSEs in English and maths, at grade C or above, on entry. The EYFS has been amended to require staff holding a new Early Years Educator qualification to have achieved GCSEs in English/English Language and maths, at grade C or above, in order to count in the staff ratios at level 3. From September 2014, GCSE English and maths, at grade C or above, will be required on exit from a level 3 early years apprenticeship. This is an interim measure to support the sector in reaching the higher standards required. From August 2015, the GCSEs in English and maths, at grade C or above, will be required on entry to an early years apprenticeship.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department is also working with experts in the voluntary sector and charitable organisations to support work in these key areas.

The Licensing Act 2003 came into force in November 2005. Data on offences which are ‘alcohol related’ are drawn from the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which asks victims of violent incidents whether they perceived the offender to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence. By this measure, the number of violent incidents considered to be‘alcohol related’ has fallen from around 1.02 million incidents in 2005/06, to around 0.88 million incidents in 2012/13 (a fall of 14%). <br><br>The definition of binge drinking used by the NHS is drinking more than double the lower risk guidelines for alcohol in one session – more than 8 units for men and 6 units for women.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/100953","Department for Education","false","2014-11-04","<p>Recent research shows that young carers have significantly lower educational attainment at GCSE level than their peers, equivalent to nine grades lower overall. That’s the difference between nine Bs and nine Cs.</p><p> </p><p>That shows why it is so important that schools are able to identify and support pupils who are young carers. However a legislative approach compelling them to do so is not in keeping with our drive to reduce burdens on schools. It is important that headteachers and governors have the freedoms they need to meet their responsibilities for the welfare of their pupils in the way they consider is most appropriate.</p><p> </p><p>I am very grateful for the support of the National Governors’ Association in raising awareness about the needs of young carers and sharing resources with governing bodies. Whilst there is a lot of good practice in schools, there remains much to do to make this more widely available.</p><p> </p><p>That is why I welcome two exciting new developments led by the voluntary sector. The Big Lottery Fund are financing The Children’s Society’s “Young Carers in Focus” programme to launch a national award scheme that allows schools to be recognised for the quality of support for their young carers. The Queen’s Trust too are funding Carers Trust to develop and test best practice on young carer support in schools. Both of these initiatives will build on the work my Department has been doing with The Children’s Society and Carers Trust since 2011 to share existing tools and good practice. This includes development of an e-learning module for school staff to increase awareness in schools of young carers’ needs. We are planning to update this soon to reflect the new legislation but the current version is available on The Children’s Society’s website: <a href="http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/Young-Carers-Web-Pub-v13/player.html" target="_blank">http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/Young-Carers-Web-Pub-v13/player.html</a></p><p> </p><p>The Department of Health are also training school nurses to be champions for young carers. They will speak up on their behalf and help headteachers and governors decide how best to support them at school.</p><p> </p><p>At present we do not plan to extend the pupil premium eligibility criteria to cover young carers (or any other group). Our policy is to allocate pupil premium funding to those pupils who have experienced financial disadvantage but there is a significant cross-over between young carers and the current pupil premium target population. Research indicates that as many as 60 per cent of young carers could be eligible for free school meals, so already attract the pupil premium.</p><p> </p><p>We will continue to encourage schools to use the resources that are already freely available to them and to make links to their local young carers support group.</p><p> </p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Mr Edward Timpson",,"2014-11-04T17:03:12.6797048Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/100953/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/100953/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/100953/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-10-21","Carers: Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking to support young carers in school.","false","Biography information for Simon Wright","Norwich South","Simon Wright","905652"
