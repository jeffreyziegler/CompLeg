Benchmarks have now been agreed for most public sector Prison Service establishments which allow the reporting of staffing levels against benchmarks at prison level.

The first set of verified data using agreed benchmarks was for 30 June 2014.</p><p> </p><p>NOMS is aiming to recruit approx 1,700 Prison Officers in 2014/15, into post or onto merit lists.

As with all HR databases, extracts are taken at a fixed point in time to ensure consistency of reporting. Rounding to 10 accurately depicts the level of certainty with which information is held. However, it does mean that the level of shortfalls presented here is the difference of the benchmark to the rounded staff numbers and will therefore differ slightly from the unrounded figures which are used internally.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-11-05T17:31:00.3378328Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/102061/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/102061/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/102061/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-10-31","Prison Officers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prison officer vacancies at each grade there were in each prison in each month since January 2014.","false","Biography information for Sadiq Khan","Tooting","Sadiq Khan","212856"

It would likely have prevented his extradition at the stage he was surrendered and, quite possibly, altogether.&quot; (Official Report, Col 177, 9 July 2013)<br><br>The Government also looked closely at the manner in which Ireland had dealt with the issue of lengthily pre-trial detention, considering their ‘charge and try’ provision and the extent to which it has had an impact on Arrest Warrant cases (for instance, as shown by the judgment in Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform v Bailey (21 March 2012).<br><br>In framing the section, the Government also recognised that the legal systems of some other Member States (e.g. Sweden) require that the person be present in the jurisdiction in order for the decisions to charge and try to be taken. Full consideration was given to this position, with section 12A being clear that in cases where the decisions have not been taken, the person’s absence from the issuing State must be the sole reason for that failure if extradition is to take place. In all cases, if the issuing State is not trial-ready then extradition cannot take place.</p><p> </p>","Staffordshire Moorlands","Karen Bradley","212696 ; 212786","2014-11-10T16:00:48.6059661Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101945/answer","Biography information for Karen Bradley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101945/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101945/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-10-30","European Arrest Warrants","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what evidence her Department holds on extraditions of British nationals from the UK that took place over the period April 2009 to April 2014 under the European Arrest Warrant which led to the bringing into force of section 12A of the Extradition Act 2003.","false","Biography information for Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg","North East Somerset","Jacob Rees-Mogg","212701"

That is why we implemented a new “Victims’ Code” in December 2013, which gives victims of crime clearer entitlements from criminal justice agencies and better tailors services to individual need.</p><p>The Government appointed Baroness Newlove as Victims’ Commissioner on 21<sup>st</sup> December 2012.

The majority of services being funded will be commissioned locally by Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) whilst the MoJ continues to commission some services nationally:</p><p>Since 1<sup>st</sup> October 2014, PCCs have been responsible for commissioning the majority of victims’ services (including victim-initiated restorative justice) for their areas, as they are best placed to understand the needs of their local communities.

Most cases of mis-selling relate to purchases that were made between 2005 and 2010. Many purchasers and investors were advised to take out mortgages in Swiss Francs. As the Swiss Franc strengthened the cost of loans rose. Those affected complain that they were not properly advised that interest rates and exchange rates could rise which would affect the cost of their mortgage over time. We are also aware of allegations that lawyers and property professionals were working collectively and against the best interests of foreign buyers.</p><p>The British Government has no authority to intervene in matters concerning Cypriot domestic legislation. However, we continue to work with the Cypriot government to assist in finding resolutions to problems related to property purchases in Cyprus. This has included organising working visits to the UK for staff from the Cypriot Land Registry and the Financial Ombudsman. The High Commission is involved in assisting with public sector reform - specifically with the Ministry of Justice and local government – which will ultimately impact on the way property issues are dealt with.</p><p>Although we cannot intervene in individual cases, we do raise wider property problems by lobbying at high level. Both the Leader of the House of Commons and First Secretary of State, my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), and I have raised property issues experienced by British nationals with the Cypriot Foreign Minister, Ioannis Kasoulides. Most recently I raised the subject with Mr Kasoulides on 23 July and Cyprus property mis-selling was raised in the UK Parliament on 22 July.

A <br>child’s welfare is always the overriding consideration. <br><br>Responsibility for the care, protection and accommodation of all child trafficking victims rests with local authorities that have well-established <br>child support arrangements and a statutory duty under the Children Act 2004 to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children in need of protection, including trafficked children regardless of their nationality or immigration status. Under these arrangements, looked after children are provided with access to services to meet all their needs be they in relation to education, accommodation, psychological or health.<br><br>Information as to the location of victims of trafficking, including children, is not held centrally once their status as a victim has been confirmed. <br>This is because the National Crime Agency's UK Human Trafficking Centre has no further role in the process and support is provided by other partners, most notably local authorities in relation to children. The Review of the National Referral Mechanism recommendsthat the Government introduces improved arrangements for tracking victims following an NRM decision and the Government is currently considering its response to the review.<br><br>In January 2014 the Government announced proposals to trial specialist independent advocates for trafficked children. The trial, which began on 8 September 2014, will last for a period of 12 months across 23 local authorities in England. <br><br>The Modern Slavery Bill gives these advocates a statutory basis and the status they need to effectively support and represent the child. The Bill commits the Government to lay a report before Parliament setting out the steps the Government will take in relation to advocates for victims of child trafficking under these powers. Lessons learned from the trials will be detailed in the report, at which point we will be in a better position to assess what works best in supporting and protecting these vulnerable children.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Staffordshire Moorlands","Karen Bradley","212441","2014-11-13T17:27:30.7052778Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101584/answer","Biography information for Karen Bradley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101584/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101584/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-10-29","Human Trafficking: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the Answer of 16 October 2014 to question 209897, how many of the 88 minors who are non-UK nationals and were recorded as victims of sexual trafficking in the most recent figures still reside in the UK.","false","Biography information for Steve McCabe","Birmingham, Selly Oak","Steve McCabe","212426"

A <br>child’s welfare is always the overriding consideration. <br><br>Responsibility for the care, protection and accommodation of all child trafficking victims rests with local authorities that have well-established <br>child support arrangements and a statutory duty under the Children Act 2004 to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children in need of protection, including trafficked children regardless of their nationality or immigration status. Under these arrangements, looked after children are provided with access to services to meet all their needs be they in relation to education, accommodation, psychological or health.<br><br>Information as to the location of victims of trafficking, including children, is not held centrally once their status as a victim has been confirmed. <br>This is because the National Crime Agency's UK Human Trafficking Centre has no further role in the process and support is provided by other partners, most notably local authorities in relation to children. The Review of the National Referral Mechanism recommendsthat the Government introduces improved arrangements for tracking victims following an NRM decision and the Government is currently considering its response to the review.<br><br>In January 2014 the Government announced proposals to trial specialist independent advocates for trafficked children. The trial, which began on 8 September 2014, will last for a period of 12 months across 23 local authorities in England. <br><br>The Modern Slavery Bill gives these advocates a statutory basis and the status they need to effectively support and represent the child. The Bill commits the Government to lay a report before Parliament setting out the steps the Government will take in relation to advocates for victims of child trafficking under these powers.

Proportionally, more women than men are serving short sentences so they will benefit particularly from this element of the reforms.</p>",,"Lord Faulks",,"2014-11-17T14:18:29.543Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101679/answer","Biography information for Lord Faulks","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101679/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/101679/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-10-29","Prisoners: Females","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many women were in prisons in England on 30 June in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively.","false","Biography information for Baroness Corston",,"Baroness Corston","HL2501"
