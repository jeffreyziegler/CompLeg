The British Antarctic Survey has led on a range of relevant scientific activities, including with international partners, to determine the abundance of krill, the factors that influence it's distribution, and the crucial role that krill plays in the Antarctic ecosystem. Work also includes studies to explore the overlap between fishing vessels and krill-eating seabirds and marine mammals, and the risks to these predators. The UK has proposed to CCAMLR that krill fishing activities should be moved offshore to avoid any potential overlap with the foraging areas of breeding wildlife. The UK has therefore welcomed the recent announcement by the Association of Responsible Krill Harvesting Operators (ARK) to voluntarily implement such measures.
