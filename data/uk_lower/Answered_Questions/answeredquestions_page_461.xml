Three-year rolling averages are generally used for monitoring purposes, in preference to single year rates, in order to avoid undue attention to year on year fluctuations instead of the underlying trend.</p><p> </p><p><br> Suicide rates in England are low compared to other European countries and have steadily reduced, with the lowest number ever recorded in 2007, but with a small rise since then. However, around 4,500 people took their own life in 2012 so suicide continues to be a major public health issue, particularly at a time of uncertainty.<br> <br> Our suicide prevention strategy, <em>Preventing suicide in England: A cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives</em> published in September 2012 already recognises men, particularly young and middle-aged men, as being the highest risk group for suicide.<br> <br> This message was reinforced in the first annual report on the Strategy, published in January 2014, which acknowledged that ‘men aged 35-54 years are now the group with the highest suicide rate. Understanding and addressing the factors associated with suicide in men, or working to limit their negative impact, will help to reduce population suicide risks’.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Further, at the time of the first annual report Professor Louis Appleby, Director of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness, wrote to all Directors of Public Health and Health and Wellbeing Board leads to draw the report to their attention.</p><p> </p><p><br> We published <em>Preventing suicide in England: Assessment of impact on equalities</em> alongside the suicide prevention strategy. The assessment acknowledges the duty of the public sector to advance equality and reduce inequality which was established by the Equality Act 2010. Recognition of the implications for the people sharing protected characteristics in the Equality Act 2010 was an integral part of the process of developing the suicide prevention strategy.</p><p> </p><p><br> We also published an Impact Assessment alongside the consultation on the suicide prevention strategy in July 2011. This assessment recommends that the financial benefits of the strategy for the ‘main affected groups’, will include savings from averted emergency treatment and the involvement of police and coroner at around £2 million for a ten-year period, at an opportunity cost of around £4 million. There are also large savings from reduction in fatalities - valuation of life – at around £7 billion. Although the Impact Assessment does not apportion any of these savings to specific impact groups, the strategy’s focus on ‘high-risk’ groups would specifically include the highest risk group, men in the 35-54 year age bracket.</p><p> </p>",,"Earl Howe","HL2969 ; HL2970 ; HL2971 ; HL2972","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156550/answer",,,,,,,,,,"2014-12-03T15:42:47.493Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156550/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156550/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-11-19","Suicide","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of the financial impact on families and the overall costs to the Exchequer of suicide; and what proportion of that impact is attributable to suicide by men.","false","Biography information for Lord Boateng",,"Lord Boateng","HL2973"

The programme objectives are to design and test new service pathways to cancer diagnosis which are based on sound medical evidence, make efficient use of resources and take full account of patients' views. The programme ends in June 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department’s Policy Research Programme funds the Policy Research Unit in Cancer Awareness, Screening and Early Diagnosis at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London. The unit carries out research to inform the development of policies that promote diagnosis of cancers at an earlier stage than that prevailing at the moment. These might include policies to enhance access to screening and diagnostic facilities, technical innovations in screening and diagnosis, policies to improve public awareness of cancer and cancer symptoms, and to encourage prompt seeking of medical advice for symptoms. The unit is addressing this need with a programme of research carried out in all areas of England in co-operation with screening services, primary and secondary care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We take the issue of ensuring rapid access to innovative therapies, including those for cancer, very seriously. This is why we have launched an external review of the pathways for the development, assessment and adoption of innovative medicines and medical technology. This review will consider how to speed up access for National Health Service patients to cost-effective new diagnostics, medicines and devices. It will set out both short and long-term options for action by Government and relevant bodies (including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and NHS England), and mark a major contribution to the policy debate.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p>","Mid Norfolk","George Freeman",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156582/answer",,,,,,,,,,"2014-11-26T17:24:19.887Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156582/answer","Biography information for George Freeman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156582/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-11-19","Cancer","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will commission research on (a) innovative pathways to diagnose cancer earlier and (b) encouraging the use of such pathways in the NHS.","false","Biography information for Mrs Sharon Hodgson","Washington and Sunderland West","Mrs Sharon Hodgson","215202"

These impact assessments are conducted on a case by case basis and they take into account the type of educational establishment, age range and size, the proximity to the proposed UTC and the school or college’s published exam results and Ofsted rating (which might affect their popularity).

Weighted assumptions were applied to the overall energy investment figures in the 2013 pipeline to reflect this.</p><p> </p><p>At the summer refresh, to provide as much clarity as possible for industry and investors, it was decided only to name energy projects where a final investment decision or other firm commitment had been made to a project as opposed to the previous approach which was largely based on those projects that had applied for connections. The remainder of the money which is anticipated to be spent in generation was then included in a balancing line. This reflects the fact that the government makes no judgment on the outcome of the competitive process between developers. This change in presentational structure did not affect the underlying modelling assumptions regarding the amount of anticipated investment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The flood section of the pipeline in the December 2013 publication contained a large number of very small projects. At the summer refresh, the smaller schemes were grouped in to the Regional Flood and Coastal Committee programmes, with only the larger schemes being listed out individually. Further details on the full programme of works is available via the Environment Agency website. As with the changes to the energy section of the pipeline, this is for ease of reference and does not reflect any change to the overall level of planned floods investment.</p><p> </p><p>An update of the pipeline will be published alongside the National Infrastructure Plan this December</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey","Danny Alexander",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156178/answer",,,,,,,,,,"2014-11-21T13:19:43.327Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156178/answer","Biography information for Danny Alexander","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156178/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2014-11-18","Infrastructure","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, what the reason is for the difference in the number of projects and programmes listed in the infrastructure pipeline data published by his Department in 2013 and 2014.","false","Biography information for Dan Jarvis","Barnsley Central","Dan Jarvis","215093"

They also suffer poor mental health and far higher levels of acute and chronic illness than the general population. Improving their health outcomes – and the outcomes of other vulnerable groups – is a challenge but it is the best way to improve public health. We are addressing these issues through the Inclusion Health programme. The programme has published advice and guidance to help the health system understand better the needs of these groups, commission services in a way that reflect these needs, and remove barriers to care.
