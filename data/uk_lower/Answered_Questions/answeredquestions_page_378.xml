In my meeting with the Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, I encouraged him to take forward the proposed dialogue with renewed urgency. In my meeting with the Rwandan Foreign Minister, I underlined the need for constructive engagement to solve the Burundi crisis. I was clear with the Burundian Foreign Minister that President Nkurunziza must take up President Museveni’s offer of mediation and engage in talks with all parties. This follows a number of telephone calls I have made to the Burundian Foreign Minister following the inflammatory comments made by the President and President of the Senate. This engagement is the latest example of the lead role that the UK has played in building a single, consistent, international community response to the security situation in Burundi. In January we set up a group of key international partners, who have since worked together to develop a common strategy and encouraged President Nkurunziza to engage with the international community and respect the principles of the Arusha Agreement. In June the UK appointed a Special Envoy to the Great Lakes, Danae Dholakia, who is active in delivering our messages on Burundi. We have supported the East Africa Community in delivering a regional solution. And we have encouraged the African Union efforts to play a strong role in organising an inclusive dialogue outside of Burundi. This would do much to help to pave the way for delivery of a sustainable solution to the crisis. We continue to work with the African Union to mobilise the financial and political resources to support the mediation process. It was under the UK’s Presidency of the UN Security Council that Resolution 2248 was agreed. This Resolution demonstrates the unity of the international community in its approach to the crisis. We continue to work with our colleagues around the world on contingency options. In addition, the Department for International Development is providing £14.25 million to support the relief efforts for refugees fleeing to the region. The Department for International Development is further providing £3.9 million for the refugee response in Rwanda through the United Nations and non-governmental organisations. This has been used to fund refugee transport, medical care, shelters and food rations. Finally, the UK strongly supported a sanctions regime for Burundi. Four individuals have been listed so far. The European Union and African Union are giving consideration to further sanctions against individuals.","Rochford and Southend East","James Duddridge","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/438185/answer",,,,,,"2015-12-22T12:00:56.227Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/438185/answer","Biography information for James Duddridge","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/438185/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2015-12-14","Burundi: Security","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what steps he has taken to contribute towards stabilising the security situation in Burundi.","false","Biography information for Lord Mann","Bassetlaw","John Mann","19981"

Of these, our greatest area of focus has been the conflict-affected east of the country, which receives one third of our budget and hosts our only sub-national office in Goma. DFID programme design also takes into account need, geographic and logistical constraints, conflict, political issues, and presence of other donors. Whilst we increasingly focussed on the six provinces, we deliberately preserved some flexibility. Some activities, for example addressing humanitarian crises, do not observe provincial borders.</p><br /><p>The regional picture in the DRC became more complex in September 2015 as the country’s 11 provinces were divided into 26, in a process called decoupage.

Defra is in the final stages of concluding a quota realignment exercise which, when complete, will represent a 14% uplift in the amount of quota the inshore fleet currently receives. Quota units which were under-utilised by Producer Organisations (POs) in 2012 were identified for re-allocation. Three quarters of the Fisheries Quota Allocations relating to underutilised quota from POs has now been permanently realigned to the inshore fleet, with the balance to be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>The Government has also taken steps to support England’s inshore fleet under the landing obligation, or discard ban. The demersal landing obligation comes into force on 1 January 2016, following the successful introduction of a discard ban for pelagic fisheries in 2015. The introduction of the demersal landing obligation will be phased in for all quota fisheries between 2016 and 2019. The discard plans for 2016 introduce landing obligations for clearly defined fisheries, including haddock, whiting, sole, <em>Nephrops</em>, hake and plaice.</p><p>As a result of vessels no longer being able to discard, an uplift in quota will be awarded to fishermen so they can land formerly discarded fish. The allocation of quota uplift is a devolved matter, and Minister Eustice announced the Government’s policy for allocating quota uplift for the English fleet in October this year.</p><p>In 2016, the non-sector pools will receive the first 100 tonnes of any quota uplift received and then 10% of any remainder, before the rest is issued to the POs on behalf of their members. Defra consulted on the implementation of the demersal landing obligation and responses indicate that the inshore fleets have high discard rates as a result of low quotas. The Government considers this quota uplift to go some way to helping small-scale fishermen adapt to the first year of the demersal discard ban.</p><p>As the landing obligation represents the largest change in fisheries management for a generation, it is important that we continue to support all our vessels as they adapt to this significant change. We must therefore take stock of all that is going on in fisheries management before any further decisions are made with regard to quota reallocation in the future.</p>",,"Lord Gardiner of Kimble","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/437023/answer",,,,,,"2015-12-22T16:57:51.717Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/437023/answer","Biography information for Lord Gardiner of Kimble","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/437023/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2015-12-10","Fisheries: Quotas","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they have to review the UK's fishing quota, in particular with regard to whether small-scale fishermen receive a fair share of that quota.","false","Biography information for Baroness Parminter",,"Baroness Parminter","HL4489"

However, GDP surpassed its pre-recession level in Q2 2013 and the UK’s economic recovery is now well established. Since 2010, on average, the UK has been the joint fastest growing economy in the G7 and the labour market has continued to make strong progress.</p><br /><p>According to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), excluding full-time students under the age of 25, the employment rate of people aged 16-49 fell from 76.9% in the three months to May 2008 to a post-recession low of 74.0% in the three months to March 2010. Since mid-2011, the employment rate for this group has increased over time and the latest data shows that it reached a record high of 77.7% in the three months to October 2015.</p><br /><p>While the recession had less of an impact on the employment rate of people aged 50-64, their current employment has also reached a record high for this group, of 70.0%.</p><br /><p>The analysis in Resolution Foundation’s report you mention looked at real median weekly earnings of various cohorts over time. While not strictly cohort analysis, more recent cross-sectional data from the ONS’s Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) shows that the increase in nominal median gross weekly pay between April 2014 and April 2015 varied across age groups as follows[1]:</p><ul><li>16-17 year olds: 8.2%[2]</li><li>18-21 year olds: 4.0%</li><li>22-29 year olds: 3.2%</li><li>30-39 year olds: 1.1%</li><li>40-49 year olds: 2.6%</li><li>50-59 year olds: 2.5%</li><li>60+ year olds: 1.9%</li></ul><p>CPI inflation over the same period was -0.1% in the year to April 2015.</p><br /><p>Pay, and ultimately living standards are strongly linked to productivity. That is why the Government is working hard to boost productivity, and therefore wages, with the ambitious measures outlined in our Productivity Plan. Our higher pay, lower tax, lower welfare society is the route to raising living standards for everyone in the UK.</p><br /><p>[1] Employees on adult rates of pay whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence</p><p>[2] Figures for 16-17 year olds include employees not on adult rates of pay</p>","Grantham and Stamford","Nick Boles","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/437072/answer",,,,,,"2015-12-22T22:11:09.627Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/437072/answer","Biography information for Nick Boles","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/437072/answer",,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2015-12-10","Average Earnings","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, what the implications are for his Department's policy of the analysis undertaken by the Resolution Foundation set out in its report, The Pinch, published on 10 December 2015, of (a) the effects of the financial events of the last 10 years on those aged 16 to 44 relative to those aged 55 to 64 and (b) the changes in that period in levels of real median weekly earnings across different cohorts of the population.","false","Biography information for Philip Boswell","Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill","Phil Boswell","19607"

In secondary science, children are taught about the content of a healthy human diet, such as carbohydrates, fats and oils, proteins, vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre and water, and why each is needed. They also learn about the consequences of imbalances in the diet, including obesity.</p><p>In design and technology lessons (key stages 1 to 3), children are taught about food, nutrition and healthy eating and how to cook a repertoire of dishes. Pupils in primary schools are taught about healthy eating and the importance of a good, balanced diet.

This makes clear that this might include pastoral support, counselling or peer mediation, engaging parents and in some cases offering separate on-site educational provision to provide respite for the bullied individual so they are able to continue to attend school. In extreme cases, where a child has developed complex needs as a result of bullying, which cannot be met in mainstream education, then alternative provision may need to be arranged.

These organisations train teachers and pupils in schools to prevent bullying and deal with its impact when it occurs so that bullied children do not suffer continuing distress.

These include familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) (which leads to premature cardiac disease and reduction in life expectancy), and conditions which increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.</p><p>The responsibility for commissioning FH services lies with local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). Provision of services will take into account the needs of the population overall.</p><p>NICE has published a guideline on the identification and management of FH which includes recommendations that children at risk because they have a parent with FH should have diagnostic tests before the age of 10. The national clinical director (NCD) for heart disease at NHS England is working to promote cascade testing for the relatives of people who have hypercholesterolaemia. NHS England’s NCD has also worked closely with the British Heart Foundation in their appointment of FH Nurses to undertake genetic testing, and with the other major charity in this field - HEART-UK.</p><p>NHS England is working closely with Public Health England (PHE) to identify the barriers to FH testing (and cholesterol management in general) with the support of the British Heart Foundation and a great deal is now being done to raise the profile of this condition, break down the barriers to genetic testing and provide better management of the condition.</p><p>With regards to those conditions which may raise the risk of sudden cardiac death, the National Screening Committee concluded that a national screening programme was not appropriate. However, children who are taken on by football clubs for formal youth training do undergo cardiac screening as do a number of professional sports participants.</p><p>A recent review concluded that childhood obesity not only increases cardiovascular risk in adulthood, but it is also associated with cardiovascular damage during childhood.</p><br /><p>To identify and support children classified as obese and therefore at risk of cardiovascular disease, PHE oversees delivery of England’s National Child Measurement programme (NCMP). NCMP provides robust local and national data on child weight status to inform health service planning and engage families through the provision of feedback of results to parents. Local authorities are provided with guidance to support the delivery of the NCMP programme and encouraged to sign post parents to local weight management services where possible.</p><br /><p>The programme covers children in Reception (ages 4-5 years) and Year 6 (ages 10-11 years), and is now a mandated public health function of local authorities.</p><br /><p>There is also strong evidence for a positive association between physical activity and cardio-metabolic health among school aged children, with higher levels of physical activity associated with higher levels of cardiovascular and metabolic health.</p><p>PHE is working to support children to adhere to healthy eating guidelines and meet the Chief Medical Officer’s physical activity guidelines through a number of approaches including through its flagship Change4Life programme and the development and implementation of the framework, ‘Everybody Active, Everyday’ at national and local level.
