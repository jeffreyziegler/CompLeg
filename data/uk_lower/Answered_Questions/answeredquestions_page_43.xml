The strategy works with a range of partners across England and Wales in the advice, voluntary and pro bono sectors to provide practical support for litigants in person. This includes online and self-help resources, as well as access to free or affordable legal advice and representation, where possible. For example, the Support Strategy continues to work with with the North East Law Centre in Newcastle Upon-Tyne to extend its reach and receive referrals from across the region, including from non-specialist services such as GP surgeries, and increase awareness of the expert advice available to litigants in person in the area.</p><p> </p><p>In February 2019, we published the Legal Support Action Plan which included a commitment to enhancing support for litigants in person. This will be achieved by increasing the funding provided to the Litigants in Person Support Strategy to £3m a year, for the next two years.

Hub schools are taking a leading role in improving the teaching of early reading through systematic synthetic phonics, early language development, and reading for pleasure.</p><p>There is a substantial body of evidence that shows that systematic phonics is the most effective method for teaching early reading. Reflecting this, the Department introduced the light touch phonics screening check for year 1 pupils in 2012. Phonics performance is improving: in 2018, there were 163,000 more six-year-olds on track to become fluent readers compared to 2012. This represented 82% of pupils meeting the expected standard in the phonics screening check, compared to just 58% when the check was introduced in 2012.</p><p>The Department have appointed Myland Community Primary school as an English Hub in Colchester, and Elmhurst Primary School in Newham. Both of these hubs will work with schools in Essex to improve the teaching of early reading.</p><p> </p><p>In 2016, new tests and frameworks for teacher assessment were brought in at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2, following the introduction of a new, more challenging National Curriculum that set higher expected standards for reading, writing and mathematics. These changes mean that the expected standard from 2016 is higher and not comparable with the expected levels used in previous years' statistics. It is not possible to make direct comparisons between the results before and after the changes in 2016.</p><p> </p><p>The number and percentage of state-funded pupils, at the end of Key Stage 1, 2 and 4, who did not achieve the expected level of literacy[1] in Witham, Essex and England are in the attached tables. Figures relate to academic years 2013/14 to 2017/18. The Department does not produce statistics for Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, or the UK as a whole, and therefore these figures relate to England only.</p><p> </p><p>[1] There is not a definitive definition of ‘expected level of literacy’ for each key stage. Figures have been provided for achievement in English, or English subjects, in the headline or additional measures that were used for that key stage, in each academic year.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb","252537","2019-05-16T14:43:04.433Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125640/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125640/answer","252537_252538_Literacy_Attainment_KS1_KS2_KS4.xls","252537_252538_Literacy_Attainment_KS1_KS2_KS4.xls","252537_252538_Tables","252537_252538_Tables","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125640/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-05-09","Pupils: Literacy","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, how many pupils at the end of (a) Key Stage 1, (b) Key Stage 2 and (c) Key Stage 4 did not meet the expected level of literacy in (i) Witham constituency, (ii) Essex, and (iii) the UK in the last five years for which data is available.","false","Biography information for Priti Patel","Witham","Priti Patel","252538"

Information for children taken into care is shown in the attached tabled.</p><p>The government wants every child to be in a stable, loving home that is right for them. One of the key principles of the legislation which underpins the UK’s child protection system, is that children are best looked after within their families. However, that is not always possible and, as a last resort, local authorities can apply to the courts for a care or supervision order where the child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm. In making their decisions, the courts must be satisfied that the threshold for significant harm has been met and that taking the child from his or her family’s care will be in the child’s best interests.</p><p> </p><p>Where a child cannot live at home, we must make sure they are safe and receive the highest quality care, which is why we are working hard to improve the social care support for children across England through our reform programme, Putting Children First. We have also established the Children’s Social Care What Works Centre, whose initial research priority focuses on ‘what works in safely reducing the need for children to enter care’.</p><p> </p><p>In the Autumn Budget, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an additional £410 million for adult and children’s social care in 2019-20. A further £84 million is also being invested over the next 5 years through the Strengthening Families, Protecting Children programme. This programme will support up to 20 local authorities with high or rising demand for children’s social care services to improve the support offered to vulnerable children and their families. Through this, we aim to enable more children to stay at home thriving in stable family environments, and safely reduce the number of children entering care.</p><p> </p><p>Across the government, we are also tackling the problems that cause children to be in need in the first place. This includes better supporting those with alcohol-dependent parents, the introduction of landmark legislation for those affected by domestic abuse, preventing young people being drawn into serious violence, and unprecedented investment in early years education and support for children and young people’s mental health.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","252574","2019-05-14T15:46:32.12Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125713/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125713/answer","252568_252574_Children_In_Care_Table.doc","252568_252574_Children_In_Care_Table.doc","252568_252574_Table","252568_252574_Table","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125713/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-05-09","Children in Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what recent assessment he has made of the (a) number of and (b) reasons for children being taken into care.","false","Biography information for Tim Farron","Westmorland and Lonsdale","Tim Farron","252568"

Information for children taken into care is shown in the attached tabled.</p><p>The government wants every child to be in a stable, loving home that is right for them. One of the key principles of the legislation which underpins the UK’s child protection system, is that children are best looked after within their families. However, that is not always possible and, as a last resort, local authorities can apply to the courts for a care or supervision order where the child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm. In making their decisions, the courts must be satisfied that the threshold for significant harm has been met and that taking the child from his or her family’s care will be in the child’s best interests.</p><p> </p><p>Where a child cannot live at home, we must make sure they are safe and receive the highest quality care, which is why we are working hard to improve the social care support for children across England through our reform programme, Putting Children First. We have also established the Children’s Social Care What Works Centre, whose initial research priority focuses on ‘what works in safely reducing the need for children to enter care’.</p><p> </p><p>In the Autumn Budget, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an additional £410 million for adult and children’s social care in 2019-20. A further £84 million is also being invested over the next 5 years through the Strengthening Families, Protecting Children programme. This programme will support up to 20 local authorities with high or rising demand for children’s social care services to improve the support offered to vulnerable children and their families. Through this, we aim to enable more children to stay at home thriving in stable family environments, and safely reduce the number of children entering care.</p><p> </p><p>Across the government, we are also tackling the problems that cause children to be in need in the first place. This includes better supporting those with alcohol-dependent parents, the introduction of landmark legislation for those affected by domestic abuse, preventing young people being drawn into serious violence, and unprecedented investment in early years education and support for children and young people’s mental health.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","252568","2019-05-14T15:46:32.167Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125743/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125743/answer","252568_252574_Children_In_Care_Table.doc","252568_252574_Children_In_Care_Table.doc","252568_252574_Table","252568_252574_Table","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125743/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-05-09","Children in Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he has taken to reduce the number of children being taken into care; and what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of measures implemented by his Department to support that aim.","false","Biography information for Tim Farron","Westmorland and Lonsdale","Tim Farron","252574"

Departmental resources have been dedicated to achieving these aims and recommendations set out in the PCS. For example, the department has established a Virtual Freight Team, bringing together expertise in road, rail, aviation, and maritime to ensure consistent cross-modal communication and understanding on freight matters. Other initiatives are also underway, such as the £10 million funding from the department for a new access road at Newhaven Port. This work, as well as other ongoing work on port connectivity with industry, will continue as we seek to maximise the value of ports to the UK economy.</p><p> </p><p>Maritime 2050 sets out a long-term vision for the UK maritime sector. 184 recommendations are made in the strategy, with each identified as either short term (1- 5 years), medium term (5-15 years), or long term (more than 15 years). These recommendations are for both Government and industry to deliver together. The Government has already begun acting on these recommendations, for example in announcing £100,000 worth of funding for careers roadshows for girls, to be delivered by the 1851 trust. More funding announcements are to be made over the coming months.

The United Nations High Commission for Refugees, as well as other humanitarian charities, advise that no new adoption applications should be considered in the period after a disaster or fleeing from war. It is not uncommon for children in these circumstances to be temporarily separated from their parents or other family members who may be looking for them. Efforts to reunite children with relatives or extended family should therefore be given priority.</p><p>Foster parents are recruited by fostering services which include local authorities or independent fostering agencies. The decision to let someone foster a child, including UASC, is a very important one to get right. Anyone who wants to become a foster parent must undergo a full assessment and be approved by a fostering service before any child can be placed in their care. Regulations set out in detail the requirements of the approval process, including the information that must be collected in the assessment and the requirement for a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. In 2013 Department for Education streamlined and strengthened the assessment and approval process for foster carers, introducing a two-stage process to ensure efficiency and transparency.</p><p>Existing foster parents may also be able to provide suitable homes for unaccompanied children and over the past two years the Department for Education has funded over 2000 training places for existing foster parents and support workers who wish to care for UASC, with places being prioritised for local authorities participating in the National Transfer Scheme.</p>",,"Baroness Williams of Trafford",,"2019-05-23T15:45:23.327Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125840/answer","Biography information for Baroness Williams of Trafford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125840/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1125840/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-05-09","Asylum: Children","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government, further to the Written Statement by Baroness Williams of Trafford on 8 May (HLWS1504), whether they expect local authorities will offer extra placements to Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children (UASC); and whether offers from individual British families to adopt or to foster UASC will be taken up.","false","Biography information for Lord Hylton",,"Lord Hylton","HL15630"

Additional funding is provided through the 16 to 19 funding formula, including over £500 million across England in 2018-19 to support disadvantaged students and therefore improving social mobility.

The funding has been allocated between the Combined Authorities and the Greater London Authority, and will be used to develop new services and support them in engaging with existing service provision.</p><p>As recommended by the UKSA, we have included CHAIN (Combined Homelessness and Information Network) statistics within the Rough Sleeping Statistics release. Overall, 7 per cent of people seen sleeping rough by outreach workers across London during 2017/18 had served in the armed forces at some point in their lives. 3 per cent of these were UK nationals - around 135 people. Although CHAIN offers more information on the flows and characteristics of people rough sleeping, data quality is influenced by the number of outreach workers active on any one night. Therefore a local authority which does not have a commissioned outreach team may appear to have fewer rough sleepers than an adjacent borough which does have an active outreach service.</p><p>MHCLG is actively encouraging local authorities with significant numbers of rough sleepers to improve their year-round data. We are working collaboratively with local authorities to develop improved homelessness data and outcomes that can measure progress in reducing rough sleeping and homelessness.</p><p>In April 2018, we introduced a new data capture tool called H-CLIC. H-CLIC captures information on all those who engage with local authority homelessness services and will collect information on the support needs of a household, including support need resulting from being in the armed forces.</p><p>We are also establishing local data pilots which will seek to improve the evidence on rough sleeping in some areas.
