Employers will have access to a larger pool of training providers to deliver the training that meets their needs and supports growth. We are achieving this by giving small and medium-sized employers in England access to the full benefits of our award-winning online apprenticeship service, on the same basis as levy-payers.</p><p>To make sure there is a well-managed gradual transition for smaller employers away from the current system and onto the apprenticeship service, we are extending contracts with providers for training apprentices with non-levy payers until April 2020.</p><p> </p><p>The recent settlement will determine budgets for the 2020-21 financial year only.

That’s a record high and up £10 billion in real terms since 2010.</p><p> </p><p>For instance, in terms of the support we provide, the UC50 questionnaire incorporates a 'light touch' evidence gathering process for cancer patients, and makes clear that Clinical Nurse Specialists and consultants can provide information on the form, therefore making the claim and assessment process simpler for people with cancer. This ensures the Department can make accurate and timely payments of Universal Credit.</p><p> </p><p>Staff delivering Universal Credit undergo a comprehensive learning journey designed to equip them with the tools, skills and behaviours required to provide a high quality service to all claimants, including those who have cancer and other serious health conditions. Colleagues receive on-going learning in their roles and have access to Universal Credit guidance which is refreshed at regular intervals.</p><p> </p><p>It is important to ensure those affected by cancer receive the most appropriate support and we have worked closely with many representative organisations to improve the WCA process for those affected. From January 2013, the categories of cancer treatments under which a claimant can be treated as having limited capability for work-related activity (LCWRA) have been expanded to include individuals who are awaiting, receiving, or recovering from treatment by way of chemotherapy irrespective of route, and radiotherapy.
