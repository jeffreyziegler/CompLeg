"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/228638","Ministry of Justice","false","2015-03-25","<p>Sexual offences committed against children are abhorrent and the independent courts rightly reflect that when sentencing offenders for such offences.</p><p> </p><p>Overall custodial sentence lengths for sexual offences have increased significantly since 2010. The average custodial sentence for all sexual offences increased from 49 months in 2010 to 59.1 months in 2013. Between 2003 and 2013 the average custodial sentence length rose by 19.1 months. These increases are the result of longer sentences for the most serious sexual offences following the implementation of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the creation of Extended Determinate Sentences in 2012.</p><p> </p><p>The most serious sexual offences against children carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, including rape, assault by penetration and paying for the sexual services of a child under the age of 13. This Government has taken steps to further strengthen the law by legislating in the Criminal Justice &amp; Courts Act 2015 to end automatic early release for anyone receiving a custodial sentence for rape of a child under 13.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to legislation, in December 2013 the Sentencing Council issued a revised guideline on sentencing for sexual offences, which came into force in England and Wales in April 2014. The guideline makes it clear that the court’s starting-point, when considering a sentence for any serious sex offences against children, is a substantial custodial sentence. The guideline takes an expanded approach to how courts assess offenders and victims.</p>The figures in the table below have been calculated from a list of statutory sexual offences against children. This includes offences where the victim is described as under 13, under 16, aged 13-17 or aged 16-17. Statistical data on all sexual offences are published annually and are available for the period 2010-2013.
