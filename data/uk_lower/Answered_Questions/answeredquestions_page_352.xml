Given the significant contribution GA animals make to modern scientific progress, the breeding of such animals has increased significantly over the last 20 years. In 2014, 1.94 million GA animals were bred which accounted for around half of all scientific procedures on living animals.</p><p>The breeding of GA animals is complex in which significant numbers of animals need to be bred in order that those with the desired genetic alteration can be selected. The biological inevitability therefore is that surplus animals, for example those without the desired genetic alteration, will be bred and not further used. Nevertheless, under ASPA, the Home Office is committed to ensuring that no animals should be bred unnecessarily and therefore we are taking steps to ensure that GA breeding colonies are managed as efficiently as possible.</p><p>ASPA requires licensees to apply the principles of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) at all times, including in the context of the production and use of GA animals. The framework was created in consultation with GA breeding experts as well as animal welfare and animal protection groups. It provides background information, lines of enquiry and examples of acceptable findings, as well as the underlying performance standards and potential performance outcomes that establishments may wish to measure in order to benchmark their progress.</p><p>The framework is currently being rolled out in a number of establishments and we aim to publish it on our website over the coming months. This approach places the UK as a leader in managing the complex breeding and use of GA animals and we are aware of other countries which are keen to adopt our model once published.</p>","Staffordshire Moorlands","Karen Bradley",,"2016-03-14T16:26:30.267Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/458923/answer","Biography information for Karen Bradley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/458923/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/458923/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2016-03-09","Animal Experiments","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what progress she has made on reducing the number of genetically modified animals bred for experiments but killed as surplus to requirements.","false","Biography information for Kelvin Hopkins","Luton North","Kelvin Hopkins","30465"

The Government's Life Chances Strategy will address cultural disenfranchisement directly - ensuring there is real engagement by arts organisations with those who might believe that culture is not for them, meaning that many more children can have the doors opened to their wonderful cultural inheritance.</p><p>The Government has already invested £171 million between 2012-15 in 123 Music Education Hubs to ensure that children aged 5-18 have the opportunity to sing or learn a musical instrument, and a further £75 million of funding was made available for 2015/16. A new, fairer funding system ensures hubs can target money towards pupils who need it most. We have also introduced the In Harmony programme which inspires and transforms the lives of children through community-based orchestral music-making in areas of exceptional deprivation. Both of these programmes offer opportunities for children and young people in the local area to attend after school sessions to learn music. In addition, we have helped create 14 pilot music rehearsal spaces for young people across urban and rural areas of England experiencing multiple deprivation.</p><p>Analysis from the most recent Taking Part Survey shows that in 2014/15, 16.7% of respondents aged 5 -10 years from the upper socio-economic group took part in music lessons outside school compared with 6.6% of those from a lower socio-economic group.

One of the best ways is as part of a ‘whole-school’ approach, in which pastoral and behavioural support systems recognise the role that all staff have a part to play in supporting and maintaining the positive emotional wellbeing for all pupils. This can include effective teaching about mental health through the Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) curriculum and involvement of specialists in schools who can provide more specific support where needed.</p><p> </p><p>We have funded guidance and age-appropriate lesson plans on teaching mental health in PSHE.

As one of the most prominent activists in Honduras, Berta Cáceres worked tirelessly over many years to promote the rights of indigenous communities. My Noble Friend, The Rt Hon Baroness Anelay of St Johns, Foreign and Commonwealth Minister of State for Human Rights, condemned the murder in the clearest terms on 04 March and also called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. These points and a wider call for a commitment to human rights and those who defend them, were set out in an EU statement which the UK has strongly supported. Since initial events, the EU delegation in Honduras has been in contact with the main stakeholders and will continue to follow up. The Honduran authorities are now taking forward an investigation into what happened. While it is too early to comment on its outcome, we welcome their swift action to initiate an investigation. Cáceres’ death – and the injuries sustained by Gustavo Castro Soto, a human rights defender who was also a victim in the attack – are clear evidence of the risks activists face in Honduras every day. We continue to call on the Honduran Government to take steps to improve the security situation, and we raise our human rights concerns with them regularly – as the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr Swire) did during a visit to the UK by a Honduran parliamentary delegation in September 2015. These issues are discussed with the Honduran authorities during frequent visits to the country by Carolyn Davidson, Our Ambassador to Honduras, resident in Guatemala, and we seek to improve the situation on the ground through a range of Embassy-sponsored projects, including with Oxfam and the Tribunal for Women Against Femicide.

Evidence presented to and discussions in the Taskforce underlined the complexity and severity of the current set of challenges facing child and adolescent mental health services, including investment and funding arrangements. The work of the Taskforce resulted in the publication of the Government report, Future in Mind, which established a clear and powerful consensus about system-wide transformation to improve CYPMH.</p><p>This Government is committed to delivering this. An additional £1.4 billion has been made available over the course of this parliament to support this transformation programme, which includes investment in a range of mental health services for children and young people services, including psychiatric services. This includes £150 million to improve eating disorders and £75 million for perinatal mental health services.</p><p>Most of the additional funding is going direct to local areas to invest in transforming their services, but we need to balance this with investment nationally for workforce and system development, which sets the foundations for transformation.

This is from the date of the first construction completions in 2000-01 to the date of the very last payment in 2049-50. The revenue payment figures include not just the financing costs (debt repayment and interest) for initial construction but also the costs of all the other services such as building maintenance and support services (cleaning, catering, portering etc) provided over the lifetime of the contract.

Given the lack of any consensus the Government has no current plans to make changes to the Civil Partnership Act 2004.</p><p> </p><p>On 29 January 2016 the High Court dismissed a legal challenge to the lack of availability of civil partnerships to opposite sex couples.
