The UK is chairing a group of over 90 countries who are working together in 2016 to develop the Multilateral Instrument, which will simultaneously update the global network of over 3000 bilateral treaties to implement some of the changes resulting from the BEPS project. The group includes emerging economies and developing countries as well as OECD members. The vice-chairs of the group of representatives from China, Morocco and the Philippines, highlighting the importance of the multilateral instrument to developing countries and their central involvement in its design.</p><p> </p><p>As a result of our G8 Presidency, more than 90 countries have agreed to automatically exchange taxpayer financial account information. These global agreements will provide a step change in the ability of countries to tackle tax evasion as participating countries will be automatically sending and receiving information about the offshore financial accounts of taxpayers.</p><p> </p><p>All countries will be able to benefit from these changes to the international tax system, but some will require additional support if they are to do so. International organisations are therefore producing practical toolkits to help developing countries implement BEPS standards and the Government is funding international organisations to assist developing countries in obtaining technical assistance on issues such as transfer pricing. The Government funds the Global Forum and World Bank to support developing countries in implementing exchange of information systems and last year the Government announced a partnership with the Ghana revenue authority to pilot the new standard on automatic exchange of information. The Government also funds tax capacity building in the vast majority of its priority developing countries bilaterally and multilaterally, as well as through peer-to-peer technical assistance from HMRC.</p><p> </p>","South West Hertfordshire","Mr David Gauke",,"2016-04-18T16:59:09.99Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511292/answer","Biography information for Mr David Gauke","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511292/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511292/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2016-04-12","Developing Countries: Taxation","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, what discussions he has had with his Cabinet colleagues on the effect of tax avoidance and evasion on developing countries as part of his preparations for the forthcoming UK Anti-Corruption Summit.","false","Biography information for Imran Hussain","Bradford East","Imran Hussain","33610"

Amongst those additional requirements is a broader definition of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).</p><p> </p><p>Those subject to the directive are required to:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Identify and verify the identity of their customer ('customer due diligence') and of the beneficial owner (person(s) who ultimately owns or controls the customer on whose behalf a transaction is being carried out, e.g. in the case of a company, the owner of a sufficient percentage of the shares or votes), and to monitor their business relationship with the customer,</p><p> </p><p>Report suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing to the public authorities</p><p> </p><p>Ensure that personnel are properly trained and that appropriate internal preventive policies and procedures are set up.</p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is not a financial institution nor does it fall into the non-financial sector organisations identified by the Directive, and it is not a provider of goods where payments are made in cash in excess of €15,000.</p><p> </p><p>The responsibility of implementing the requirements of the Directive is for the financial sector and the non-financial sectors identified by the Directive and not the MOD.</p><p> </p><p>The new Directive gives additional guidance in dealing with those risks and issues relating to corrupt activities. As with all legislation it cannot differentiate between those nations, sectors and institutions that are more or in the UK's case, less corrupt. What this Directive attempts to do is give those organisations and sectors at risk of money laundering and terrorist finances the ability to make their own judgements as to what they deem as a high risk person (PEP) or transaction. Whilst ambassadors, chargés d'affaires and high-ranking officers in the Armed Forces are included in the Directive as PEP's, the financial institutions in particular will assess their individual risk. In some countries the military are involved and in some cases run the political and governing systems, this makes them a significant corruption risk. The UK, its ambassadors, chargés d'affaires and high-ranking officers carry a lesser risk than some others; it is therefore unlikely that the extended Directive will affect them. But the interpretation of the Directive is for the financial and certain non-financial sectors to interpret.</p><p> </p><p>The MOD takes its responsibility to prevent, detect, deter and investigate fraud (including corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing) very seriously and has undertaken detailed risk assessments to identify its risks, where needed implementing additional preventative and detective controls and undertakes due diligence on its suppliers.</p><p> </p><p>Transparency International publishes a Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index based on 77 indicators which assesses the existence, effectiveness and enforcement of a nation's ability to manage the risk of corruption including money laundering.</p><p> </p><p>The UK MOD scored an 'A' (very low corruption risk) in the 2015 index, the only country to achieve this in the G20 and NATO as well as being one of only two in the world to achieve this.</p><p> </p><p>Transparency International attributed the 'A' to the UK MOD having strong anti-corruption systems underpinned by effective independent oversight mechanisms.</p><p> </p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster",,"2016-04-18T15:39:02.923Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511336/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511336/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511336/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-04-12","Money Laundering: EU Law","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, if he will identify for the purpose of Article 3(9)(F) of the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive which ranks in the armed services will be classed as high-ranking.","false","Biography information for Sir Charles Walker","Broxbourne","Mr Charles Walker","33498"

It is committed to delivering the vision set out in <em>Future in mind</em>, the previous Government’s report on the work of the <em>Children and Young People’s Mental Health and Wellbeing Taskforce</em>. This report established a clear and powerful consensus about change across the whole system, including health, social care and education. To support this transformation programme the Government is committed to making an additional £1.4 billion available over the course of this Parliament.</p><p> </p><p>As a first step in this transformation programme all clinical commissioning groups working with their partners, have developed Local Transformation Plans to transform their offer for children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing. These plans cover the full spectrum of mental health issues: from prevention and improving access, to support and care for existing and emerging mental health problems, as well as transitions between services. <br> <br> Whilst the intention is to prevent mental health problems from arising in the first place, improving access for those who have developed problems as early as possible is essential. By 2020, at least 70,000 more children and young people each year will have access to high quality mental health care when they need it. This will require systems for rapid identification of children in need of specialised services, and improved links between different agencies so that children and young people are referred to the most appropriate service. £28 million is being spent on extending and expanding the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme so that by 2018 all children and young people across England will have access to evidence-based and appropriate interventions. The Government has also invested nearly £3 million into the Mental Health Services and Schools Links Pilots to jointly train designated leads in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and schools to improve access to mental health services for children and young people. This should reduce the number of children being turned away from services and lead to the ‘no wrong door’ approach that is integral to the transformation programme.</p><p> </p>",,"Lord Prior of Brampton",,"2016-04-26T13:04:43.573Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511547/answer","Biography information for Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511547/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/511547/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-04-12","Mental Health Services: Children","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what action they propose to take to prevent mental health services from turning away children who seek help.","false","Biography information for Lord Ouseley",,"Lord Ouseley","HL7589"

As a result of this work, and after substantial operational, technical and commercial negotiations with a range of leading aerospace companies, it became apparent that repair of all the existing Viking and Vigilant fleets was not economically sustainable. In particular, there was no reliable contractor able to take on a large scale refurbishment of the Vigilant fleet.</p><p>The reduced glider fleet will operate at fewer, but larger, regional Volunteer Gliding Squadrons. Where Cadets have to travel longer distances investment is being increased to provide good quality residential accommodation. There will also be an uplift in Tutor aircraft, for powered flying from 45 to 70, and the formation of two additional Air Experience Flights, as well as the provision of 25 part task trainers.</p><p>The Air Cadet Organisation are developing their courses, which centre on a common syllabus focusing every single flight on training rather than providing a passenger experience, be that in the air with gliding and powered flight or through synthetic training on part-task trainers funded by the RAF Charitable Trust. The redesigned courses provide a Cadet flying training structure like that used by our future RAF Typhoon and Lightning II pilots. Cadets will learn basic flying skills from an early point in their Air Cadet careers starting with ground school lessons and realistic synthetic training on part task trainers, building flying experience. This smart use and integration of synthetic flying during the early stages alongside powered and glider flying means that the Air Cadet of the future will once more have aviation opportunities unmatched by any other National Cadet Force worldwide.</p>","Canterbury","Mr Julian Brazier",,"2016-04-19T16:54:19.82Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/510030/answer","Biography information for Sir Julian Brazier","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/510030/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/510030/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-04-11","Air Force: Gliding","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what assessment he has made of the effect of the (a) reduction in the number of gliders available for Air Cadet forces, (b) reduction in the number of gliding induction courses and (c) closure of 14 volunteer gliding squadrons on the operations and activities of air cadet squadrons across the UK.","false","Biography information for Charlotte Leslie","Bristol North West","Charlotte Leslie","33368"
