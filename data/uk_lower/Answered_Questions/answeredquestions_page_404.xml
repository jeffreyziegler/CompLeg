So, whilst a Category A prisoner cannot have ROTL and Category B prisoners can take it only in exceptional circumstances, lower category prisoners who are eligible to be considered for ROTL are held in category B and in some category A prisons. The key test is whether the prisoner in question is eligible to be considered, has a legitimate purpose for temporary releases linked to the sentence plan, and passes the rigorous risk assessment required.</p><p>Since 2013 when the process was revised there has been a 39% drop in the number of temporary release failures.

However, the report notes the phenomenon of âsecret contractingâ involving Somali natural resources and national assets. The rise of this phenomenon is particularly concerning. The British Government works in close partnership with the Somali authorities and other international partners, such as the World Bank, to improve the overall transparency and accountability of public financial management in Somalia. We recognise that much has been done over the last two years to improve the very poor financial management systems that the Federal Government of Somalia inherited in 2012. We welcome in particular the introduction of an automated financial management information system and the establishment of a âFinancial Governance Committee (FGC)â, a forum which has enabled the International Financial Institutions to give advice on reform of asset management, public sector procurement, and public financial management. The FGC also reviews government contracts, which has resulted in the termination and renegotiation of some major contracts.

It does not measure the type of institution attended, the level of course studied, whether the student graduated or how long it has been between finishing the course and departing from the UK.
