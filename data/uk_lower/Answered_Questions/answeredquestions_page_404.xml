However, the report notes the phenomenon of “secret contracting” involving Somali natural resources and national assets. The rise of this phenomenon is particularly concerning. The British Government works in close partnership with the Somali authorities and other international partners, such as the World Bank, to improve the overall transparency and accountability of public financial management in Somalia. We recognise that much has been done over the last two years to improve the very poor financial management systems that the Federal Government of Somalia inherited in 2012. We welcome in particular the introduction of an automated financial management information system and the establishment of a “Financial Governance Committee (FGC)”, a forum which has enabled the International Financial Institutions to give advice on reform of asset management, public sector procurement, and public financial management. The FGC also reviews government contracts, which has resulted in the termination and renegotiation of some major contracts.
