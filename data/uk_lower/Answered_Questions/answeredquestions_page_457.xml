This group has worked towards developing a better working culture, encouraging staff to tackle or raise a concern as soon as possible and dispelling any perception that concerns will not be taken seriously and acted upon. We will continue to reinforce the message that managers are required to treat seriously all concerns raised; to be initially neutral; and to take action as appropriate. Advice on our Intranet has been streamlined, made more user-friendly, and is accessible to all staff. There is also a ‘Respect Toolkit’ offering further guidance on BHD issues, and we are developing the role of our global network of ‘First Response Officers’ who can help support and advise individuals over BHD related concerns. These actions are not specific to staff with disabilities but cover all staff raising concerns about BHD. The 2014 staff survey results are currently being analysed and we will again act on the outcomes of that analysis. <br><br>The FCO’s Human Resources Directorate has a dedicated Disability Support Team. This team is responsible for providing advice and support to disabled colleagues and their line managers, and for raising disability awareness and confidence across our organisation.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167315","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2015-03-26","<p><strong><em>Decentralisation</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The Coalition Government decentralised housing, regeneration and economic development to the Mayor of London from April 2012. This enables him to shape programmes and direct funding to meet London’s needs.</p><p> </p><p>As part of the transfer of housing and regeneration functions we provided a capital grant of around £2.6 billion to the Greater London Authority up to 2014-15 to fund the housing and regeneration programmes inherited from the Homes and Communities Agency, the London Development Agency and for the development of the Olympic Park.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Budget measures</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Our commitment to support London was set out in the recent Budget, where the Government set out the following proposals for London:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£1 million to allow the London Land Commission to create a comprehensive database of public sector and brownfield land.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£7 million to the Greater London Authority to support the development of the Croydon Growth Zone. This could unlock over 4,000 homes and 10,000 jobs.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£97 million of funding and a ring-fenced local 50% share of business rate growth to support the London Borough of Barnet and the Greater London Authority’s plans for the regeneration of Brent Cross. This will unlock approximately 7,500 homes of which at least 15% will be affordable.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Consult on giving greater powers over planning on sightlines and wharves to the Mayor of London, allowing the Mayor to accelerate provision of new homes by reducing planning delays.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Affordable housing investment</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Government funding for new affordable housing in London is as follows: 2010-11: £1.1 billion (outturn), 2011-12: £712 million (outturn), 2012-13: £400 million (budget), 2013-14: £392 million (budget); 2014-15: £516 million (budget). However, this understates the total expenditure on new affordable housing in this Parliament. Across England, our affordable housing programme in 2011-15 is delivering £19.5 billion of public and private investment in affordable housing; about a quarter of which is being provided in London.</p><p> </p><p>This investment continues to contribute to the provision of new affordable homes for Londoners, of which 51,300 had already been delivered in London between April 2010 and the end of September 2014.</p><p> </p><p>A further £1.07 billion has been allocated from the 2015-18 Affordable Homes Programme, to deliver another 32,000 new affordable homes in London. In addition a further £180 million has been allocated from the Affordable Homes Guarantee Programme to deliver 8,700 homes. The Greater London Authority has so far announced initial grant allocations of £404 million to deliver 18,000 new homes and are now inviting further bids on a continuous market engagement basis. Again, the grant funding understates the total anticipated expenditure on affordable housing. We will deliver a total of 275,000 new affordable homes across England in 2015-20, with £38 billion of public and private investment. London’s allocation for 2018-20 has not been finalised.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Building more rented accommodation</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The London Housing Bank is a new housing fund intended as a springboard to home ownership for aspirational working households on lower incomes. Through London Housing Bank, we are providing the Greater London Authority with £200 million of low-cost loan funding to deliver 3,000 – 4,000 new homes by March 2018.</p><p> </p><p>The Greater London Authority has already announced the first allocations of funding from the London Housing Bank, which will help deliver intermediate rental homes. These schemes include: Peabody Homes in Thamesmead; Isis part of the wider Hale Wharf regeneration site; and Quintain part of the continued regeneration of Wembley Park.</p><p> </p><p>Under our £1 billion Build to Rent fund we have contracted 4 schemes in London worth over £63 million and delivering 671 homes for private rent.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Improving social housing</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We have awarded Decent Homes Backlog Funding of £821 million to 14 London Boroughs. This funding has so far made 42,110 homes decent. Gap funding granted to stock transfer landlords of £24 million has helped ensure that less than 0.9% of their stock failed the Decent Homes Standard at the end of March 2014.</p><p> </p><p>A further £145 million has been awarded to 9 London Boroughs to tackle their remaining Decent Homes Backlog. This will help to ensure that no more than 10% of stock in each local authority is non-decent by April 2016.</p><p> </p><p>We have also taken steps to protect leaseholders from excessive works charges imposed by local authorities.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Reducing empty housing</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We have provided the Greater London Authority with £29 million to bring 1,600 empty homes back into use as affordable housing. Our full package of reforms to tackle empty housing is outlined in the written answer of 17 March 2015, Question 227326.</p><p> </p><p>London Boroughs have been allocated a total of £720 million of New Homes Bonus funding for 2011-2016, recognising over 140,000 additions to stock, and over 15,000 long-term empty properties returned to use. Almost 50,000 of these also received the premium for affordable homes.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Supporting self-build and custom build</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>In July 2012 we launched the Custom Build Homes Loan Fund and we delegated £5 million to the Greater London Authority to administer schemes in London. Bids exceeding this were submitted to the Greater London Authority and £4.8 million was allocated. We have exempted self-builders from Community Infrastructure Levy and Section 106 tariffs.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Promoting home ownership schemes</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Since the start of the Help to Buy scheme in March 2012, over 5,300 families across London have brought a home using the support of a Government loan or guarantee, of which over 4,200 sales were to first-time buyers. This includes 2,430 under the Equity Loan sales scheme (of which 2,304 were to first-time buyers), 2,175 under the Mortgage Guarantee sales (of which 1,955 to first-time buyers) and 721 Newbuy sales (data is not available for the number of first-time buyers).</p><p> </p><p>We have reinvigorated the Right to Buy, with a proportion of the sales receipts being used to build new housing. This increases housing supply, moves people up the housing ladder and gets people off waiting lists.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Supporting locally-led regeneration schemes</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We, with the Mayor, are investing each investing £200 million to create 20 new Housing Zones which will deliver 50,000 homes in London. The Mayor announced the first eleven Housing Zones in London in February 2015.</p><p> </p><p>We are working with the Greater London Authority and Transport for London to unlock 11,000 homes at Barking Riverside.</p><p> </p><p>We have invested around £125 million through Get Britain Building for twenty two schemes which has resulted in starts for 3,000 homes. The schemes include:</p><p> </p><p>Brentford Locks West – Get Britain Building funding enabled the first phase of this mixed use scheme by Isis Waterside Development to be delivered, bringing forward the first three blocks which deliver a total of 150 homes.</p><p> </p><p>Grahame Park, Brent – Get Britain Building funding unlocked a phase of this major regeneration scheme that had stalled. The first block of homes was completed in March 2014 with the final homes due to complete in March 2015.</p><p> </p><p>Lewisham Gateway - Get Britain Building funding will deliver 193 units and indirectly support the delivery of an additional 701 homes.</p><p> </p><p>We have shortlisted four housing estates in London for a share of a £150 million Government loan fund for Estate Regeneration. These schemes are in Grahame Park, in Barnet; Blackwall Reach and New Union Wharf, in Tower Hamlets and Aylesbury Estate, in Southwark. They would provide more than 8,000 new homes, of which more than 3,000 would be additional homes</p><p> </p><p>The Government announced in 2012 a UK Guarantee which would allow the Mayor of London to borrow £1 billion at a new preferential rate from the Public Works Loan Board to support the Northern Line Extension. We have aslo recently made regulations allowing the retention of 100% of business rates growth in the area from which to fund the borrowing. The extension is critical to the realisation of the £8 billion Battersea Power Station redevelopment, as well as the wider regeneration of the Vauxhall and Nine Elms area.</p><p> </p><p>Surplus Public Sector Land capable of delivering almost 28,000 homes has been sold in London. This was critical towards helping us achieve our wider ambition to dispose of land for 100,000 homes across England by the end of March 2015.</p><p> </p><p>We have supported a number of other regeneration projects in London. These include:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£141 million capital grant to the Greater London Authority for Olympicopolis – this project aims to develop a new education and cultural quarter on the Olympic Park.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£10 million capital funding for the London Enterprise Fund to support the regeneration of Croydon and Tottenham (2011-12).</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Royal Albert Docks Enterprise Zone - we awarded a grant of £12 million from the ‘Building Foundations for Growth’ fund which is designed to accelerate progress on the zones to maximise long-term job creation. This supports the Mayor’s priority for growth in East London and building on past 30 years of regeneration in the wider area. Regeneration of the Royals will support the convergence of East London with the wider city area.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Tackling homelessness and rough sleeping</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We have supported the Mayor in tackling homelessness in London through:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£34 million grant to tackle rough sleeping across London;</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Developing a pioneering £5 million Social Impact Bond to improve the outcomes for a large group of persistent rough sleepers in London;</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Providing £3.8 million from the Homelessness Transition Fund for the No Second Night Out scheme to help new rough sleepers off the street quickly in London; and</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Allocating £2.8 million of Single Homelessness funding in 2011/12 to take forward a package of measures to prevent and tackle single homelessness, including rough sleeping.</li></ul><p> </p><p>In addition we have provided £167 million Homelessness Prevention Grant to local authorities in London to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.</p><p> </p><p>There is more to do, but I hope this illustrates the decision action taken by this Government to build more affordable homes and help people move on and up the housing ladder.</p>","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis","219222","2015-03-26T15:20:07.953Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167315/answer","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167315/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167315/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-12-02","Housing: Greater London","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what assessment his Department has made of the effect of housing costs in London on the ability of employers to recruit staff; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Ms Diane Abbott","Hackney North and Stoke Newington","Ms Diane Abbott","216724"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167370","Department for Transport","false","2014-12-09","<p>The Highways Agency has systems installed across the motorway network which measure the speed and volume of traffic flows using inductive loops buried in the carriageway or roadside radar. When the number of vehicles rises above certain predefined thresholds and/or if the speed of traffic drops below a set level, progressively slower speeds are set on the motorway signs and signals. In some locations these are advisory speed limits and act as a safety measure to gradually reduce the speed of traffic to avoid sudden braking and bunching, which is a notable cause of accidents. It also helps to protect the back of any queue that may have formed. On ‘Smart Motorways’ the systems trigger mandatory speed limits that provide the safety benefits already mentioned but also maintain traffic flows and thus reduce overall journey times.</p><p> </p><p>Even though the safety and congestion benefits of this system have been proven, there are circumstances where the systems can be triggered to show reduced speeds even when traffic flows appear light. For example, a slow moving abnormal load or heavy equipment on an inclined section of motorway.

The earlier diagnosis money is designed to support improved direct general practitioner (GP) access to four key diagnostic tests to support the diagnosis of brain tumours, bowel, lung, and ovarian cancers; and increased testing and treatment costs in secondary care. GPs are able to access these tests directly in cases where the two-week urgent referral pathway is not appropriate but a patient’s symptoms require further investigation. The intention is that more people presenting with relevant symptoms will be tested and at an earlier stage.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2012, the Department published ‘Direct access to diagnostic tests for cancer: best practice referral pathways for general practitioners’ to provide criteria for accessing these diagnostic tests.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The earlier diagnosis money also supports centrally led Be Clear on Cancer (BCOC) symptom awareness campaigns to raise the public’s awareness of cancer symptoms and encourage people with persistent symptoms to go to the doctor. Since 2011 the Department and Public Health England (since 2013) in partnership with NHS England (including NHS Improving Quality) and other stakeholders have run national BCOC campaigns for bladder and kidney, bowel, breast and lung cancers; regional campaigns for ovarian, oesophagogastric cancers, and local pilot campaigns to raise awareness of four symptoms of unexplained bleeding, lump, pain, and weight loss; and awareness of skin and prostate cancers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As part of the BCOC campaign process, the Department, Public Health England, and NHS England have worked with Cancer Research UK and other partners to develop briefing sheets to support GPs and other healthcare professionals during the campaigns.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>More generally, to increase awareness of cancer amongst GPs, the Department supported British Medical Journal (BMJ) Learning to develop and launch an on-line learning tool for GPs in 2012. The tool offers accredited professional development and includes four modules - tackling late diagnosis; risk assessment tools; cancer pathway and the role of primary care; and diagnosing osteosarcoma and brain tumours in children with an additional section on communication skills. The tool can be accessed at:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://learning.bmj.com/learning/home.html" target="_blank">http://learning.bmj.com/learning/home.html</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2013, Macmillan Cancer Support, partly funded by the Department, piloted an electronic cancer decision support (CDS) tool for GPs to use in their routine practice. It is designed to help GPs recognise the symptoms of cancer and identify patients that they might not otherwise refer urgently for suspected cancer. The CDS covers lung, colorectal, oesophagogastric, ovarian and pancreatic cancers and a new symptom checker for melanoma. Following the pilot, Macmillan Cancer Support is able to offer the tool to GPs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to this, since 2005, the Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has supported GPs to identify patients with the symptoms of suspected cancer and urgently refer them as appropriate.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167522","Home Office","false","2014-12-09","<p>This Government has overhauled Tier 4 of the Points-Based System with a package of measures to tackle the widespread abuse that was occurring when we inherited it in May 2010, while still attracting genuine students. <br><br>We have cracked down on bogus colleges by making the Tier 4 sponsorship system more rigorous, and this has led to the removal of nearly 800 colleges from the Tier 4 sponsor register since 2011. In order to recruit international <br>students, education institutions must demonstrate education quality, by undergoing an assessment of their education standards by an independent inspectorate, and a good track record of immigration compliance. Sponsors must <br>make basic checks on students to ensure that they are genuine students. We have incentivised them to do this by reducing to 10% the permitted visa refusal rate from 1 November 2014. If more than 1 in 10 of a sponsor’s prospective <br>students are refused a visa, they will lose their Tier 4 licence. <br><br>We have made it more difficult for non-genuine students to abuse the system. They must demonstrate that they are a genuine student in a credibility interview, meet tougher English language and maintenance requirements and have <br>a proven academic track record. We have introduced a maximum time limit on the period of study in the UK and if a student wants to undertake further study, they must show that this is academic progress. We have also restricted the <br>right to work while studying for students at universities and publicly funded further education colleges, and removed them altogether for students at private colleges, where abuse was greatest. <br><br>We have ensured that the UK’s university sector remains attractive to international students - they can use their own method to determine their student’s English language proficiency, their students can work whilst studying <br>here, postgraduates can bring dependants and graduates can stay on and work if they can secure a graduate level job. We have doubled the number of places on the Graduate Entrepreneur scheme to 2,000, and created a new visa for graduates wishing to undertake a corporate internship, or professional training related to their degree. We also allow all students who have completed a PhD to stay in the UK for an additional year to work, gain experience in their chosen field, or set up as an entrepreneur. <br><br>The latest statistics show that this approach is working – applications for study visas for university students have increased by 2% in the year ending September 2014, with a 4% increase for those with an offer from a Russell Group <br>university. Whilst applications for study visas for further education – where the abuse was greatest – have fallen by 13% over the same period.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire",,"2014-12-09T14:58:48.313Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167522/answer","Biography information for James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167522/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167522/answer","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167522/answer/previousversion/31899","Biography information for James Brokenshire","1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-12-02","Entry Clearances: Overseas Students","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what changes relating to overseas students her Department has made to the points-based immigration system since May 2010.","false","Biography information for Paul Blomfield","Sheffield Central","Paul Blomfield","216746"

Between April 2013 and June 2014 there have been 59,961 referrals as a result of the introduction of this CQUIN goal;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- the Dementia Care &amp; Support Compact, the care sector’s own response to the Prime Minister’s Challenge on Dementia, sets out a commitment to support the delivery of the challenge and improve care and support for people with dementia, their carers and families;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Health Education England (HEE), Skills for Care and Skills for Health launched the pilot for the new Care Certificate on 28 April 2014. Taking place across a range of health and social care settings, the pilots are testing a set of standards designed to help employers to assess not only workers’ skills, but also the knowledge, behaviours and values that are required to deliver compassionate and quality care. The pilots are nearing completion. Subject to evaluation, we plan to introduce the Care Certificate by 1 April 2015;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- the Government’s refreshed Mandate to HEE, published on 1 May 2014, builds on the existing ambition to have 100,000 National Health Service staff receive Tier 1 training on dementia by setting an ambition for a further 250,000 NHS staff to receive Tier 1 training on dementia by March 2015, with the tools and training opportunities being made available to all staff by the end of 2018;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- 72 communities across England have signed up to the national Dementia Friendly Communities recognition process, with an increased ambition to reach 75 by March 2015;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- on 7 May 2014, Public Health England and the Alzheimer’s Society launched a major new campaign with the aim of securing one million people to become dementia friends by March 2015. The campaign is aimed at improving understanding and attitudes about dementia and towards people with the condition. There are currently over 579,000 Dementia Friends; and</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- we have made available £50 million capital funding for 2013-14 for the NHS and local authorities to work with providers to create better care environments to help people with dementia live well with the condition. The projects are now in the process of being evaluated and we will disseminate the key recommendations by the end of the year.</p><p> </p>",,"Earl Howe",,"2014-12-15T14:16:30.573Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166855/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166855/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166855/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-12-01","Dementia","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they have to ensure adequate care for dementia sufferers.","false","Biography information for Lord Taylor of Warwick",,"Lord Taylor of Warwick","HL3273"

Low income working parents can already benefit from support through the childcare element of working tax credit. Once Universal Credit is introduced this will rise to 85% of costs. From autumn 2015 almost 2 million families could benefit from a new tax free childcare scheme, worth up to £2,000 per child which will expand support for affordable childcare and stimulate demand. We are investing £50 million through a new Early Years Pupil Premium to support the early education of disadvantaged children.</p><p> </p><p>Our reforms to the role of local authorities have reduced unnecessary bureaucracy and improved consistency in accessing Government funding. All providers judged ‘good’ and ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and providers newly registered with Ofsted are guaranteed early education funding making it easier for existing providers to expand their business and new providers to enter the market.</p><p> </p><p>We have relaxed planning rules so that non-domestic early years childcare providers can deliver additional and high quality places to meet increasing demand allowing premises previously used for offices, hotels, non-residential institutions, and leisure and assembly purposes to be able to change use to nurseries. We are exploring local authorities’ use of their discretionary rate relief powers to support business rates costs falling to childcare providers.</p><p>We have brought forward legislation to enable providers to register multiple premises in a single registration process so, for example, a nursery chain can notify Ofsted of its intention to open a number of new settings in a single registration process.</p><p> </p><p>We have also brought forward legislation to remove the requirement for schools to register separately with Ofsted to take two-year-olds and are supporting partnership working between schools and private and voluntary providers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We know that high-quality childcare has a powerful impact on children’s outcomes, particularly the most disadvantaged children.

We have legislated to make the Care Quality Commission independent, and a new rigorous inspection regime for hospitals, primary care and adult social care has been introduced, resulting in a clear rating on the quality of care. We have also introduced a robust special measures regime for struggling hospitals, so that poor care is identified and rectified. In addition, we have legislated to place a new duty of candour and fit and person requirement for directors of NHS bodies, as well as to create a new offence of wilful neglect and ill treatment. This Government has also placed an unprecedented amount of data on the MyNHS website, so that the public can see how their local services perform.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Central Suffolk and North Ipswich","Dr Daniel Poulter",,"2014-12-04T16:19:54.917Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167059/answer","Biography information for Dr Dan Poulter","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167059/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167059/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-12-01","NHS: Standards","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what progress the Government has made on implementing proposals set out in his Department's publication Hard Truths: The Journey to Putting Patients First.","false","Biography information for Luciana Berger","Liverpool, Wavertree","Luciana Berger","216690"
