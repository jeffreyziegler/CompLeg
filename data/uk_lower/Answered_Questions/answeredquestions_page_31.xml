In the same period, 128 online test purchases had been attempted, with 32% (41) failing and selling to a person under 18.</p><p>The Government also continues to encourage police forces to undertake a series of co-ordinated national weeks of action to tackle knife crime under Operation Sceptre. The operation includes targeted stop and searches, weapon sweeps of hotspot areas, test purchases of knives from retailers, and educational events. The latest phase of the operation took place from 11-18 March, and overall 689 test purchase operations were carried out in retail premises. Of these, there were 559 passes. 130 (around 19%) resulted in the retail outlet failing the test purchase.</p><p>To go further in preventing the sale of knives to under-18s, the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 includes a provision that will stop knives from being sent to residential addresses after they are bought online, unless the seller has arrangements in place with the delivery company to ensure that the product would not be delivered into the hands of a person under 18.</p><p>The Government has also agreed a set of commitments with major retailers to prevent the underage sales of knives more generally in their stores and online. The agreement also covers staff training and displays and packaging. Tesco, eBay UK, Lidl UK, Amazon UK, Wilko, Argos, Asda, Poundland, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, John Lewis and Waitrose have all signed up to the principles. They have since been joined by Boots, the Co-op, B&amp;Q, Aldi, TKMaxx and Debenhams. We are working with retailers to strengthen the agreement in relation to displays and that work is continuing. Following on from this, Asda has stopped selling single knives in its stores from the end of April, a move supported by the Government.</p>","Louth and Horncastle","Victoria Atkins",,"2019-07-02T13:04:55.223Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1133620/answer","Biography information for Victoria Atkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1133620/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1133620/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-06-20","Knives: North West","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps he is taking to reduce the number of underage people in the North West of England purchasing knifes from (a) supermarkets, (b) home stores and (c) online.","false","Biography information for Sir Mark Hendrick","Preston","Sir Mark Hendrick","267187"

We currently have a limited understanding of the distribution of noise in UK seas and its impact on vulnerable species. To address this in relation to sources of continuous noise such as shipping, the UK has established a noise monitoring network, consisting of long term monitoring stations deployed in coastal waters. The information from this monitoring network will be matched with species distributions and used to inform future policy.</p><p> </p><p>In order to reduce impacts, developments such as offshore wind farms are required to have pre and post consent monitoring plans which are managed by the Marine Management Organisation. For example, a Marine Mammal Mitigation Plan lists the appropriate mitigation measures that should be utilised during offshore activities that are likely to produce underwater noise and vibration levels capable of potentially causing injury and disturbance to marine mammals. Government departments including Defra and BEIS are working together to look at how underwater noise can be managed more strategically to reduce harm.</p><p> </p><p>On land, the Government is committed to ensuring that noise is managed effectively in order to promote good health and quality of life. We have protections in place to avoid significant noise impacts through our planning system, our environmental permitting systems, in vehicle and product standards, and noise abatement legislation. Defra works with other Government departments whose policies could potentially impact on noise levels.</p><p> </p><p>National Planning Policy Guidance sets out requirements for noise to be considered for new developments with particular consideration given to development affecting designated sites. Our network of designated sites are afforded the highest level of protection. Planning authorities must consider the potential impact of activities and works on or near these sites before granting consent. Noise may also be considered for certain types of development requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment.</p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey",,"2019-06-25T15:35:21.57Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1133683/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1133683/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1133683/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-06-20","Noise: Pollution","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his Department is taking to minimize the effect of human-made noise pollution on animal habitats where it affects animals' ability to communicate.","false","Biography information for Paul Farrelly","Newcastle-under-Lyme","Paul Farrelly","267215"

At that meeting, Foreign Ministers instructed the Commonwealth Secretariat Board of Governors (of which the UK Commonwealth Envoy is a member) to agree recommendations in the light of that report by 30 November 2018. The Board fulfilled that instruction, unanimously agreeing a set of recommendations through a thorough, transparent and inclusive process. At the end of December 2019, the HLG produced a second report, focused on the Secretariat's collaboration with accredited Commonwealth organisations and other partners.

We are also working collaboratively with the Welsh Government and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to identify ways of breaking down these barriers and to ensure that every person leaving prison has somewhere to go. As part of this, we are investing up to £6.4 million over two years in a pilot scheme to help ex-offenders into accommodation from three prisons, namely Bristol, Pentonville and Leeds.

For those who fall on hard times it is only right that we give them all the support they need to put a roof over their head.</p><p>In April 2018, MHCLG introduced a new homelessness data collection called Homelessness Case Level Information Collection (H-CLIC). H-CLIC captures information on all those who engage with local authority homelessness services, including those eligible for temporary accommodation and collects information on the support needs of a household, including support need resulting from being in the armed forces. These show that during October to December 2018, of the 61,410 households owed a homelessness duty in England, 440 required additional support because they formerly served in the armed forces. There are no plans to expand this collection to cover all former armed service personnel to include those who don’t require additional support.</p><p>The majority of data collected by MHCLG from local authorities for households in temporary accommodation pre dates the reporting changes in the H-CLIC data collection introduced in April 2018. This means data on armed forces support needs of those in temporary accommodation is not available for MHCLG to collect.</p><p>The latest statistics are available here:</p><p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/804329/Statutory_Homelessness_Statistical_Release_October_to_December__2018.pdf" target="_blank">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/804329/Statutory_Homelessness_Statistical_Release_October_to_December__2018.pdf</a></p><p>The annual single night snapshot of people sleeping rough across all local areas in England provides some basic demographic information (age, gender, nationality).</p><p>The latest statistics are available here:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/rough-sleeping-in-england-autumn-2018" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/rough-sleeping-in-england-autumn-2018</a></p><p>The Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN) is a multi-agency database which records information about people seen rough sleeping by outreach teams in London across the year. Overall, 6 per cent of people seen sleeping rough by outreach workers across London during 2018/19 had served in the armed forces at some point in their lives. 2 per cent of these were UK nationals - around 115 people.

We are also establishing local data pilots which will seek to improve the data collected by a wide range of services which people who sleep rough access.</p><p>This Government is committed to reducing homelessness and rough sleeping. No one should ever have to sleep rough. That is why last summer we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy which sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now, but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all.
