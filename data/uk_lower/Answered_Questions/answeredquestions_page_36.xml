There is also a statutory entitlement for every pupil aged 14-16 to take D&amp;T and an arts subject, if they wish to do so.</p><p>Like maintained schools, academies must provide a broad and balanced curriculum. Ofsted’s new inspection arrangements, which will be introduced in September, place a renewed focus on schools ensuring all pupils receive a broad, balanced and ambitious curriculum.</p><p>The arts are an essential part of a broad and balanced education and high-quality arts education should not be the preserve of the elite, but the entitlement of every single child. Between 2016-20, we are spending almost £500 million on a range of arts and cultural education programmes.</p><p>At primary school, data from the Teacher Voice Omnibus 2016 survey revealed that the average amount of time spent teaching art and design and D&amp;T was broadly similar to the amount of time spent teaching history and geography.
