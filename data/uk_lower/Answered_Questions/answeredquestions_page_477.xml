Engagement meetings with local authorities across England were used to raise awareness of the many armed forces establishments located in isolated areas and the lack of choice military families have over the location of their Service accommodation which means that some families face transport difficulties and also struggle to maintain employment as a result of their mobility. <br><br>Similarly, DCLG published advice on provisions for locations where there is Defence housing in their Guidance on Travel Plans, Transport Assessments and Statements in decision-taking. This publication contains guidance for local authorities on the special consideration owed to service personnel and their families particularly in setting local transport strategies and plans that should consider the particular requirements of any Armed Forces families in their area.<br><br>The MOD will continue to monitor the issue through the Families Federations.</p>","Broxtowe","Anna Soubry",,"2014-09-15T15:13:51.2850229Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90978/answer","Biography information for Anna Soubry","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90978/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90978/answer","Broxtowe","Anna Soubry","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90978/answer/previousversion/19641","Biography information for Anna Soubry","11","Defence","Defence","2014-09-08","Armed Forces Covenant","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, with reference to the Armed Forces Covenant Annual Report 2013, page 67, what progress has been made on the review of public transport issues affecting service families living in remote areas; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Vernon Coaker","Gedling","Vernon Coaker","208502"

The Partner Employment Project (PEP), as part of the New Employment Model (NEM) programme, is focused on addressing the barriers that hinder spousal employment.<br><br>The PEP continues to support the delivery of two LIBOR-funded programmes which provide, respectively, employability and business start-up workshops: the LifeWorks for Families programme run by the Royal British Legion Industries (RBLI) and the ‘Supporting the Unsung Hero’ Business Start-Up programme run by the University of Wolverhampton. These two-year programmes started in October 2013 and I am pleased to say that over 200 spouses have already benefited. Demand is such that this year both programmes are delivering extra bespoke workshops in Germany and Cyprus. RBLI are also delivering a course in Belgium to support serving personnel serving in NATO, as well as developing a remotely accessed programme to enable them to reach more spouses flexibly. <br><br>Childcare provision is another key issue. Although not formally part of the PEP, a childcare study has been conducted by the MOD’s Director of Children and Young People which reviews what childcare support Service personnel currently access, identifies best practice, and considers how best to use the £20 million LIBOR funds allocated to the MOD to improve childcare infrastructure.

Public protection is foremost in the decision making process. Only prisoners whose risks are manageable in conditions of low security will be allocated to an open prison. Where necessary, offending behaviour work will be undertaken in closed conditions in order to reduce an offender's risk before transfer.</p><p> </p><p>Once allocated to open prison, prisoners continue to be monitored and are returned to closed prison immediately if there are any concerns about their suitability for low security conditions.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Placing a prisoner in open conditions serves two main purposes. Firstly, it facilitates the eventual resettlement of prisoners into the community, in conditions more similar to those that they will face in the community than closed conditions can provide. Open prisons provide resettlement benefits including opportunities for training and employment, to re-establish family ties and to enable housing needs to be met prior to the prisoner’s eventual release into the community.</p><p> </p><p>Secondly, it allows for risk to be assessed in order to inform release decisions and, should the prisoner secure release, to inform risk management plans for ongoing supervision in the community. Thus, for many prisoners who have spent a considerable amount of time in custody, this can assist in their successful reintegration in the community and help protect the public.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Keeping the public safe is our priority. That is why the current Government has taken action on both releases on temporary licence (ROTL) and absconds from prison. Last year, a fundamental review of ROTL policy and practice was commissioned and, in March 2014, a package of measures was announced to ensure that the public was properly protected. Some of those measures have been brought forward so that they begin to take effect immediately, particularly with more serious offenders where the review concluded that an enhanced risk assessment approach should be taken.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The public have understandable concerns about the failure of some prisoners to return from temporary release from open prison. Keeping the public safe is our priority and we will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders to undermine public confidence in the prison system. The number of temporary release failures remains very low—less than one failure in every 1,000 releases and about five in every 100,000 releases involving alleged offending—but we take each and every incident seriously. The Government has already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency.

Trade union activities and campaigning in local government, and indeed our Department, should be funded by members' subscriptions, not bankrolled by the taxpayer. Greater freedom from state dependency will help ensure that trade union bosses better reflect and respond to the wishes and views of the grassroots members who pay the bill.</p><p> </p><p>As the previous answer stated, our reforms to trade union facility time are estimated to save up to £400,000 a year of taxpayers’ money.</p><p> </p><p>In the age of direct debits, it is not appropriate or necessary for public resources to be used to support the collection and administration of trade union membership subscriptions. It is also unsatisfactory that trade unions like PCS continue to collect a political levy, but make no attempt to inform would-be members that the political levy exists, that it is optional or mention the right to opt out on their membership forms. This is a misleading and dubious marketing practice through omission.</p><p> </p><p>The decision by the last Labour Government to embed check-off in contracts has acted as an obstacle to ending this outdated practice. But I can confirm that my Department has ended the check off facility to new employees as the first step in phasing it out.</p><p> </p><p>We have also recently suspended check-off for all staff during the current industrial action by PCS. In turn, PCS have asked their union members to switch to Direct Debit noting in their literature “the process takes less than five minutes” and is “very simple”. This somewhat proves our point.</p>","Keighley","Kris Hopkins",,"2014-09-12T13:23:41.629817Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90630/answer","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90630/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90630/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-09-04","Trade Unions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, if he will publish the representations he has received on his proposal to end check-off for trade union subscriptions for staff working in his Department.","false","Biography information for Hilary Benn","Leeds Central","Hilary Benn","208160"

The MOD is also the largest deliverer of civilian apprenticeships across Government Departments.</p><p>The Government’s apprenticeship reform programme is aimed at ensuring apprenticeships in England become more rigorous and more responsive to the needs of employers. MOD officials do not sit on the programme boards, and this programme has not been the subject of Ministerial discussions between MOD and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). However, I can confirm that senior MOD officials are fully engaged with their BIS counterparts as we look to influence the implementation of this reform and to develop MOD policy in support of it.</p><p>It is in the MOD’s interests to ensure its supply chain contains personnel with the skills required to support defence interests. To that end the MOD seeks to reflect wider supply chain training requirements through bodies such as the Defence Growth Partnership (DGP).</p><p>MOD officials are engaged with BIS on the development of new Trailblazer apprenticeships to meet MOD and wider defence industry needs. In the context of the Aerospace Trailblazer Group the RAF has collaborated with major employers such as BAE and Airbus to produce apprenticeship standards for the manufacture of aircraft.

Schools have a duty to safeguard all children, particularly those in need of additional support which includes pupils with SEN. An attack may constitute a criminal offence and our anti-bullying advice to schools is clear that staff should seek assistance from the police if they feel an offence has been committed. In April 2014, the Department issued guidance which sets out what schools and colleges must do to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people under the age of 18.[1]</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government has made tackling all forms of bullying and harassment in schools a priority. It is never acceptable for any child to be bullied, victimised or harmed in any way. We have issued guidance for maintained and independent schools on preventing and tackling all forms of bullying.[2]</p><p> </p><p>In February and March we issued updated advice on tough but permissible sanctions to manage poor behaviour which includes bullying;[3] issued a leaflet about bullying which outlines in one place schools’ responsibilities to support bullied children;[4] and issued case studies on how good schools manage bullying.[5]</p><p> </p><p>Schools are not required by law to collect information on the number of students with SEN who have been verbally abused. However, all schools, are required by law, to have a behaviour policy with measures to address all forms of bullying. Schools have the freedom to develop their own approaches for monitoring bullying; for some, this may involve recording and monitoring specific incidents, while others prefer to survey pupils anonymously. Whatever method schools use, maintained schools are held to account by Ofsted for how well they deal with pupil behaviour and safety, which includes scrutiny of records and analysis of bullying including disability-related bullying. Independent schools are held to account by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) for their effectiveness in promoting good behaviour and guarding against harassment and bullying, including unacceptable behaviour, taking due account of any related difficulty or disability.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, we are providing £4 million of funding over two years from spring 2013 to four organisations- Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and The Anti-bullying Alliance (ABA) with the National Children’s Bureau (NCB)- \to develop effective initiatives that prevent and tackle all forms of bullying. The ABA/NCB project also trains schools to prevent and tackle bullying of students with a special educational need or disability.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90730","Department for Education","false","2014-09-10","<p>The Department for Education has not issued specific guidance for schools on what action to take when a student with special educational needs (SEN) is physically attacked by other pupils. Schools have a duty to safeguard all children, particularly those in need of additional support which includes pupils with SEN. An attack may constitute a criminal offence and our anti-bullying advice to schools is clear that staff should seek assistance from the police if they feel an offence has been committed. In April 2014, the Department issued guidance which sets out what schools and colleges must do to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people under the age of 18.[1]</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government has made tackling all forms of bullying and harassment in schools a priority. It is never acceptable for any child to be bullied, victimised or harmed in any way. We have issued guidance for maintained and independent schools on preventing and tackling all forms of bullying.[2]</p><p> </p><p>In February and March we issued updated advice on tough but permissible sanctions to manage poor behaviour which includes bullying;[3] issued a leaflet about bullying which outlines in one place schools’ responsibilities to support bullied children;[4] and issued case studies on how good schools manage bullying.[5]</p><p> </p><p>Schools are not required by law to collect information on the number of students with SEN who have been verbally abused. However, all schools, are required by law, to have a behaviour policy with measures to address all forms of bullying. Schools have the freedom to develop their own approaches for monitoring bullying; for some, this may involve recording and monitoring specific incidents, while others prefer to survey pupils anonymously. Whatever method schools use, maintained schools are held to account by Ofsted for how well they deal with pupil behaviour and safety, which includes scrutiny of records and analysis of bullying including disability-related bullying. Independent schools are held to account by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) for their effectiveness in promoting good behaviour and guarding against harassment and bullying, including unacceptable behaviour, taking due account of any related difficulty or disability.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, we are providing £4 million of funding over two years from spring 2013 to four organisations- Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and The Anti-bullying Alliance (ABA) with the National Children’s Bureau (NCB)- \to develop effective initiatives that prevent and tackle all forms of bullying. The ABA/NCB project also trains schools to prevent and tackle bullying of students with a special educational need or disability. It has published a guide to cyberbullying for SEND young people, which contains advice for schools on developing effective anti-bullying practice and we link to this report in our Departmental advice on bullying.</p><p> </p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-and-tackling-bullying" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-and-tackling-bullying</a></p><p>[3] <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-and-tackling-bullying" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-and-tackling-bullying</a></p><p>[5] <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/managing-behaviour-and-bullying-in-schools-case-studies" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/collections/managing-behaviour-and-bullying-in-schools-case-studies</a></p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Mr Edward Timpson","208159","2014-09-10T15:44:26.8205813Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90730/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90730/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90730/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-09-04","Schools: Crimes of Violence","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what guidance her Department issues to schools on what action to take when a student with special educational needs is physically attacked by other pupils on school property.","false","Biography information for Steve McCabe","Birmingham, Selly Oak","Steve McCabe","208192"
