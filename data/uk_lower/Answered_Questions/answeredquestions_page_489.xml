The findings of the COI formed the basis of the core text of the subsequent UN Human Rights Council resolution on the DPRK, adopted in March 2014, which the UK cosponsored.</p><p>In April, the same month, the UK took part in a public âArria-formula' briefing with other Security Council member states to consider DPRK human rights. In May, the UK raised DPRK human rights concerns during closed consultations between the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Security Council. In June, I visited Geneva, where I took part in an Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the DPRK, Mr Mazuki Darusman. I raised the importance of DPRK human rights with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon and stressed the importance of UN action. The next step will be to ensure there is an appropriate focus on DPRK human rights at this autumn's UN General Assembly (UNGA) session and that there is a strong DPRK resolution, strongly supported, in the UNGA Third Committee.</p>","East Devon","Mr Hugo Swire",,"2014-07-07T13:52:33.3968743Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64990/answer","Biography information for Sir Hugo Swire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64990/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/64990/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2014-07-01","North Korea","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, if the Government will bring the conclusions relating to the genocidal extermination of Christianity in the report commissioned by Human Liberty entitled crimes against humanity published in May 2014 to the attention of the UN Security Council, the North Korean Government and HM Embassy in Pyongyang.","false","Biography information for Jim Dobbin","Heywood and Middleton","Jim Dobbin","203385"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/65065","Ministry of Justice","false","2014-07-08","<p>Domestic violence is an appalling crime and we are committed to ensuring that it is tackled effectively and that victims can have confidence in the criminal justice system. The DPP recently announced that the highest ever conviction rate for domestic violence prosecutions, over 74%, and every police force is expected to have an action plan in place by September to improve further their response to domestic violence and abuse.</p><p> </p><p>Sentencing is entirely a matter for the courts taking into account all the circumstances of each case and following any relevant sentencing guidelines issued by the independent Sentencing Council. The Sentencing Council has a duty to monitor the operation and effect of its guidelines including giving consideration to the frequency with which courts depart from the guidelines, the effect of the guidelines in promoting consistency of sentencing, and the effect of the guidelines in promoting public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p><p> </p><p>Offending behaviour amounting to domestic violence is covered by a wide range of offences: there is no specific offence of domestic abuse. Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the courts, but those who perpetrate serious acts of violence and abuse are likely to face long custodial sentences. Where a court does not impose an immediate custodial sentence, the main court orders which may be imposed in such cases are community orders, suspended sentence orders, restraining orders and non-molestation orders. The overarching sentencing guideline on domestic violence identifies the principles relevant to the sentencing of cases involving violence or abuse that has occurred in a domestic context.</p><p> </p><p>In relation to breaches of community orders and suspended orders, the responsible officer makes an initial decision as to whether the offender has unreasonably failed to comply with the requirements of the order. If so, the legislation requires that the offender must either receive a warning or be returned to court for a breach hearing. Only one warning may be given in a 12 month period. If the court finds the offender in breach of a community order it must take action by: revoking the order and re-sentencing for the original offence, including possibly to custody; making the requirements of the order more onerous; or imposing a fine not exceeding Â£2,500. If the court finds an offender in breach of a suspended sentence order it must give effect to the custodial sentence unless it is satisfied that it would not be in the interests of justice to do so. If the custodial sentence is not given effect then the court must make the order more onerous or impose a fine not exceeding Â£2,500.</p><p> </p><p>A restraining order may be imposed on conviction or acquittal. Restraining</p><p>orders imposed on acquittal can be an added protection for victims in situations where the abuse may be beyond the balance of probabilities, but not beyond reasonable doubt â the standard of proof required for criminal convictions. A non-molestation order may be imposed during family proceedings. Failure to comply with these orders is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</p><p> </p><p>Sentencing guidelines also cover breaches of community orders and suspended sentence orders, and the breach of a protective order (restraining orders and non-molestation orders). The guideline on breach of protective orders emphasises that in all cases the order will have been made to protect an individual from harm, and action in response to breach should have as its primary aim the importance of ensuring that the order is complied with and that it achieves the protection that it was intended to achieve. Where violence is used to breach a protective order, custody is the starting point for the sentence. The guideline also states that non-violent conduct in breach may cross the custody threshold where a high degree of harm or anxiety has been caused to the victim.</p><p> </p>","Kenilworth and Southam","Jeremy Wright",,"2014-07-08T16:56:35.2356419Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/65065/answer","Biography information for Jeremy Wright","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/65065/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/65065/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-07-01","Domestic Abuse: Reoffenders","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment he has made of variations in the degree to which perpetrators of domestic abuse who breach court orders or fail to engage or complete offender programmes (a) face consistency in sentencing practice and enforcement and (b) consistently receive the penalty of being sent to prison when such breaches are brought back to court; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Caroline Lucas","Brighton, Pavilion","Caroline Lucas","203428"
