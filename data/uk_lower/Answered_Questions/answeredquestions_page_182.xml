For example, on the 9 October last year we announced a new partnership with the Royal Foundation, aimed at helping maintain and develop good mental fitness, thus changing the conversation around mental health into a positive and proactive one.</p><p>During working hours, there are a range of options available to Service personnel requiring mental healthcare or advice. These include contacting either their Service GP, unit medical centre, Service mental health unit, welfare, or through pastoral support. Personnel who are receiving treatment at one of the MOD's mental health facilities are also given advice on obtaining out-of-hours help. This includes contacting the local medical centre, the local NHS accident and emergency department, or one of the existing 24-hour mental health helplines. The various helplines available include the free 24-hour mental health helpline run by the charity Combat Stress (supported by the MOD), and MOD's Veterans UK free helpline (which out-of-hours provides links to the Combat Stress helpline and the Samaritans), as well as the Big White Wall, a 24-hour online community which provides safe, anonymous support to anyone struggling with mental health issues.

The purpose of the mandatory binding arbitration provision is to provide a remedy in the exceptional circumstance that those authorities are unable to reach agreement after discussing the matter for two years. It works by referring the matter to an independent arbitration panel. Each country selects a panel member and those members then select a third member. The decision of the panel is then binding on the two countries. This ensures that disputes do not continue unresolved. Unresolved disputes about the operation of the tax treaty could otherwise result in double taxation; and the fundamental object of a tax treaty is to ensure that such double taxation is eliminated.</p><p> </p><p>The new treaty does contain a number of provisions to combat tax avoidance and evasion. These include the latest OECD standards on the exchange of tax information and mutual assistance in the recovery of tax debts.

The removal in 2015 of the £5,000 cap for maximum fines that magistrate’s courts can impose, means that magistrates can hand down a potentially unlimited fine for a fly-tipping summary offence. In May 2016 we introduced fixed penalty notices of up to £400 for small-scale fly-tipping. This provides local authorities with an alternative to prosecutions and take a more proportionate enforcement response.</p><p> </p><p>In 2014 the Sentencing Council introduced new sentencing guidelines for environmental crimes, including fly-tipping. The guidelines were published to ensure a consistent approach to these offences is taken by courts in England and Wales. Requests for further guidance were received by the Sentencing Council from the National Fly Tipping Prevention Group, chaired by Defra, and the Environment Agency. This was due to concerns that the fines were not high enough to reflect the seriousness of the offences committed or to have a deterrent effect, and that there was an inconsistency in fine levels across the country. The guidelines encourage magistrates to make more use of the highest levels of fines for some of the more serious offences that come before the courts. It also helps sentencers more easily pitch a fine that is proportionate to the means of the offender.</p><p> </p><p>The Sentencing Council reviewed the effectiveness of the guidelines in 2016.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/828673","Home Office","false","2018-01-29","<p>The subsistence rates for victims of modern slavery are provided to cover the essential living needs of potential victims of modern slavery. When considering the level of these rates, the essential needs of potential victims were assessed to be comparable to the needs of asylum seekers. This is why the tested and established methodology that has been developed to measure the level of subsistence for asylum seekers will be adopted to measure the level of subsistence for potential victims of modern slavery. Within this policy, dependent children will receive a higher level of subsistence than they currently receive, and pregnant victims will receive an additional payment of £300. This will ensure that the most vulnerable individuals in NRM support will receive a greater level of finance. The policy for subsistence rates also includes the ability for individuals or their support providers to apply for further funding if there is a clear need for victims to receive more financial support to meet their essential living needs</p><p><br>Where it has been identified that victims of slavery have needs above those of asylum seekers, these needs are met within the victim care contract, for example travel costs for counselling and medical appointments. We are working closely with the Salvation Army and the Independent Anti Slavery Commissioner to ensure that the implementation of this change is as smooth as possible. <br> <br>Victims will continue to receive dedicated and expert support, which is tailored to their unique needs as victims of modern slavery. This includes access to legal aid, counselling, NHS medical and dental services. This will ensure there is a fair and consistent approach for all individuals receiving similar government support. Furthermore, more money is being made available to treble the period of “move on” support, which will help people leaving victim support with their transition to other arrangements.
