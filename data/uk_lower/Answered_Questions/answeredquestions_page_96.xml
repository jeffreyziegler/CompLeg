Veterans’ health is broadly aligned with that of the rest of the general population and most veterans’ health requirements are sufficiently met by existing NHS provision. However, several tailored initiatives are already in place to cater for specific veteran needs, including priority access to NHS secondary care in England, Scotland and Wales for Service related conditions, subject to the clinical need of all patients.</p><p> </p><p>Further measures to improve support to veterans include the recently announced Veterans Strategy: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategy-for-our-veterans" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategy-for-our-veterans</a>. By 2028 we will be doing more to ensure that each veteran is valued, contributing and supported. One of our aims is that all veterans enjoy a state of positive physical and mental health and wellbeing, enabling them to contribute to wider aspects of society. In order to achieve this outcome, we will focus our efforts on enabling consistency of medical outcomes for veterans, through a smooth transition of provision from in-Service to post-Service and sharing effective practices amongst clinical and healthcare communities; and providing bespoke treatment for those veterans who have specific health needs because of their service.</p>","Bournemouth East","Mr Tobias Ellwood","192114","2018-11-23T14:14:54.83Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1010183/answer","Biography information for Mr Tobias Ellwood","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1010183/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1010183/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2018-11-19","Afghanistan: Peacekeeping Operations","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, whether the Government plans to introduce further measures to support veterans of Operation Herrick.","false","Biography information for Adam Holloway","Gravesham","Adam Holloway","192773"

This was conducted via the Campaign Solutions framework co-ordinated by the Crown Commercial Service (CCS), which maintains a roster of 27 best-in-class advertising agencies capable of designing and delivering a major national campaign. More information on the framework can be found at: <a href="https://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm3774" target="_blank">https://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm3774</a>.</p><p>After an initial engagement meeting with all interested agencies, the brief for the apprenticeships campaign was issued to all 27 agencies on the roster. Three agencies were successful at the first stage and subsequently invited to present their proposals to a team of communications professionals including DfE’s Director of Communications and the Cabinet Office Head of Campaigns. Throughout this process, additional support was provided by professionals from the DfE Commercial Directorate and the CCS. A cross-government team, comprising specialists from the Cabinet Office and Government Communication Service, reviews all proposals for major public-sector communications campaigns to confirm that they represent industry best practice and value for money.</p><p>Ministers only meet government contractors once this process has been concluded and a winning bidder notified. M&amp;C Saatchi were notified on 8 June. I subsequently met with the senior account planner from M&amp;C Saatchi on 23 July as part of a regular ministerial apprenticeships ‘stocktake’ meeting.

Local authorities have a duty to monitor and assess air quality and to take action to reduce pollution where these breach statutory limits, and are best placed to determine local priorities.</p><p>Defra awarded a total of £2.4million to local authorities in England from the 2017/18 air quality grant fund; £3.7million was awarded in 2016/17, and £0.5million in 2015/6. £3million has been allocated for 2018/19.</p><p>Whilst all measures which reduce air pollution will reduce children’s exposure to these harmful pollutants, some projects have elements that are specifically targeted at children. For example:</p><ul><li><p>In 2016-17, the London Borough of Islington were awarded £50,000 to run a local school focused awareness and engagement campaign through the air quality grant.</p></li><li><p>In 2017/18, Spelthorne Borough Council were given £145,188 to run an awareness campaign in schools across Surrey.</p></li></ul><p>Details of further funding from the Air Quality Grant Programme, including funding specifically directed at children can be found on the Air Quality Grant Programme webpage here:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/air-quality-grant-programme" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/air-quality-grant-programme</a>.</p><p>The Government has also put in place a £3.5billion plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions, which includes £495million for councils to improve air quality. We have consulted on our new world leading Clean Air Strategy, which includes new and ambitious goals, legislation, investment and policies which will help us to clean up our air faster and more effectively.</p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey",,"2018-11-27T17:19:40.55Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1010259/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1010259/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1010259/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2018-11-19","Air Pollution: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to which schemes and projects with the specific purpose of reducing children’s exposure to air pollution his Department has allocated funding to local authorities from the air quality grant in (a) 2018- 19, (b) 2017-18, (c) 2016-17 and (d) 2015-16; and how much such funding was allocated to each of those schemes and projects in each of those years.","false","Biography information for Alex Cunningham","Stockton North","Alex Cunningham","192868"
