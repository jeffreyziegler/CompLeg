The Government response to each is as follows.</p><p>On point one in the report, the Government has been clear that the UK will not be part of the European Union relocation scheme. We remain of the view that relocation schemes within Europe risk creating perverse incentives for people to put their lives into the hands of traffickers. The Government is supporting efforts at hotspots through the deployment of resources to Italy and Greece through the European Asylum Support Office. We are fully committed to the efficient and timely operation of the Dublin Regulation and we are working closely with the Greek authorities, to identify, assess and transfer those with family connections to the UK under the Dublin family reunion process.</p><p> </p><p>On point two, through our £70 million contribution to the Mediterranean Migration Crisis response, we are funding the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration, and other agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations, and have strongly encouraged them to ensure close coordination with the authorities, to together achieve improved accommodation for refugees and migrants. Our funds are also helping to provide alternative shelter options for vulnerable migrants.</p><p> </p><p>On point three, DFID is delivering a £10 million Refugee Children’s Fund for Europe which prioritises unaccompanied and separated children. The fund provides safe places for at risk children, data management to trace children to their families, and services such as counselling and legal advice. A new Women and Girls’ Fund for Europe will provide specialised protection services, responding to the risk of exploitation, violence and trafficking, including for children.</p><p> </p><p>On point four, the Government believes that resettlement programmes are best operated at the national level. Under the Syrian Vulnerable Person’s Resettlement Scheme, we have committed to resettle 20,000 Syrians by the end of this Parliament. In addition to this through the Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement scheme we will resettle 3,000 individuals from the Middle East and North Africa region over the same period, focusing on children at risk.</p><p> </p>",,"Baroness Anelay of St Johns",,"2016-09-27T14:02:51.443Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582701/answer","Biography information for Baroness Anelay of St Johns","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582701/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582701/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-09-13","International Rescue Committee","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their response to the four points for urgent action in the International Rescue Committee situational brief of 5 September.","false","Biography information for Lord Hylton",,"Lord Hylton","HL1884"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582029","Department of Health","false","2016-09-15","<p>Improving awareness and early diagnosis of cancer is a priority for this Government, and was clearly highlighted in the report Achieving World-Class Cancer Outcomes (2015) by the Independent Cancer Taskforce. Earlier diagnosis makes it more likely that patients will receive effective treatments. We have committed to implementing recommendation 24 of the report that by 2020, everyone referred with a suspicion of cancer will receive either a definitive diagnosis or the all-clear within four weeks. This standard will be underpinned by investment of up to £300 million more in diagnostics each year by 2020.</p><p> </p><p>In order to continue to support general practitioners (GPs) to identify patients whose symptoms may indicate cancer and urgently refer them as appropriate, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published an updated suspected cancer referral guideline in June 2015. The guideline, ‘Suspected cancer: recognition and referral’ includes new recommendations for childhood cancers. NICE also addressed generally, non-site specific symptoms of concern in children and young people, recommending that GPs should take into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer.</p><p> </p><p>The Department’s National Institute for Health Research operates the UK Clinical Trials Gateway: <a href="http://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk" target="_blank">www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk</a>. This publicly available website pulls through information about clinical trials and other research from several different United Kingdom registers, including research on childhood cancers.</p><p> </p><p>Over the last four decades there have been major advances in the development of successful treatment strategies for childhood cancers, and much of this has been due to the use of standardised protocols in clinical trials and centralisation of care. NICE Improving Outcomes Guidance for Children and Young People serves to assist National Health Service trusts in planning, commissioning and organising services for children and young people with cancer. It recommends, among other things, that all care must be provided in age-appropriate facilities. The treatment children receive will depend on the type of cancer they have, and the most common treatments include surgery to remove the tumour, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy cancer cells, and stem cell and bone marrow transplants. In 2012, the Government provided £250 million to build two proton beam therapy centres in England (at University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester), the first of which will be fully operational in 2018.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is working closely with cancer charities to ensure children get the support they need during and after their treatment. Last year we announced everyone diagnosed with cancer in England will benefit from an individually tailored recovery package by 2020, a key recommendation by the independent Cancer Taskforce. The recovery package, developed by Macmillan Cancer Support, will signpost people to rehabilitation and financial support services to help with the costs of cancer.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p>","Warrington South","David Mowat",,"2016-09-15T12:34:34.43Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582029/answer","Biography information for David Mowat","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582029/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/582029/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-09-12","Cancer: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps his Department is taking to encourage a greater awareness of the (a) symptoms, (b) diagnosis, (c) research, (d) treatment and (e) support for the families of children affected by cancer.","false","Biography information for Richard Arkless","Dumfries and Galloway","Richard  Arkless","45983"

That is why the Government is clear that prevention must be at the heart of everything we do to reduce homelessness.

This includes protecting homelessness prevention funding for local authorities, which will amount to £315 million by 2019-20, to help them continue to provide quality advice and assistance to everyone who approaches them for help. Since 2010, local authorities have helped prevent or relieve over one million cases of homelessness.</p><p>Reducing homelessness is a complex issue. The causes are varied and driven by issues such as health, education, justice, welfare, and employment. That is why we have increased central investment to tackle homelessness over the next four years to £139 million, including a new £10 million Social Impact Bond to support rough sleepers with the most complex needs. This builds on the success of the world’s first homelessness Social Impact Bond, run by the Greater London Authority to turn round the lives around of 830 of London’s most entrenched rough sleepers. Over half have achieved accommodation, employment or reconnection outcomes.</p><p>In addition we have invested £15 million to improve outcomes for young people through the Fair Chance Fund. This funding is turning around the lives of around 1,900 18 to 25 year olds with complex and overlapping needs, by supporting them into accommodation, education, training and employment.</p><p>We also announced in the Budget an additional £100 million to deliver low cost ‘move on’ accommodation to enable people leaving hostels and refuges to make a sustainable recovery from a homelessness crisis, providing at least 2,000 places for vulnerable people to enable independent living.

The EYFS Profile results also show that more than 80% of children are reaching the expected communication and language skills by age five. A higher proportion of children eligible for free school meals are achieving a good level of development – 51% in 2015 compared to 45% in 2014.

We also support English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) provision, in addition to DCLG’s community-based programmes and investment in Syrian refugees’ English Language training through the Syrian resettlement programme.</p><p> </p><p>This provision is available for a wide range of learners including:</p><ul><li><p>Prisoners, through the Offender Learning and Skills Service;</p></li><li><p>Learners in the community, including through Family English, Maths and Language;</p></li><li><p>People who need ESOL;</p></li><li><p>Trainees as part of their traineeship;</p></li><li><p>Apprentices as part of their apprenticeship;</p></li><li><p>Jobseekers.</p></li></ul><p>To enable these learners to improve their literacy skills, we have embedded English at the heart of all our major programmes. This means:</p><ul><li><p>Learners who did not achieve a good GCSE pass in English by the age of 16 are now required to continue to study the subject post-16;</p></li><li><p>Since 2014/15, the English requirement for Intermediate Apprenticeships has been stronger, with all apprentices who have already achieved level 1 English having to work towards level 2;</p></li><li><p>Since 2014/15, young people undertaking a traineeship have been required to study English unless they already have level 2 qualifications in the subjects;</p></li></ul><p>We have reformed GCSEs to ensure they are more stretching and provide greater assurance of core literacy skills than the old GCSEs. In line with the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee recommendation, we recognise that some people are not ready to take GCSE so we are also improving the rigour and relevance of English Functional Skills qualifications, which are taken by many students and apprentices aged 16 and over. We have commissioned the Education and Training Foundation to revise the National Literacy (and Numeracy) Standards and reform Functional Skills with the new qualifications being delivered from September 2018.</p><p> </p><p>To ensure high quality provision is delivered, we have invested over £30m over the past 3 years to improve the quality of the English (and maths) workforce in further education, driving forward improvements in governance and leadership.</p><p> </p><p>To ensure prisoners have the opportunity to improve their literacy skills, Government accepted in principle the recommendations of the review led by Dame Sally Coates on prison education which will include developing a new curriculum for the teaching of basic literacy in prisons.</p><p> </p><p>Lastly, we are undertaking a range of research to better understand where Government investment in English has the greatest impact and delivers value for money. As recommended by the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee in their 14/15 report, Government is using behavioural insights to identify how to motivate adults to improve their English and encourage learners to keep studying once enrolled on a course. I am pleased to report that very positive trial results will be published shortly by the Behavioural Insights Team.
