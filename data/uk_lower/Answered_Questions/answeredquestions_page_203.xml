The assumptions of secularism are not a reliable guide to the way the world works, nor will they enable us to understand the place of faith in other people’s lives. Parishes and Chaplaincies of the Church of England serve people of all faiths and none. Their contribution and that of other denominations and faiths to the well-being of the nation is immense – schools, food banks, social support, childcare among many others – and is freely offered. But the role of faith in society is not just measured in terms of service delivery...The new Parliament, if it is to take religious freedom seriously, must treat as an essential task the improvement of religious literacy.”</p><p>The full text can be read here: <a href="https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchurchinparliament.org%2F2017%2F05%2F09%2Fgeneral-election-2017-archbishops-issue-election-letter%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ccaroline.spelman.mp%40parliament.uk%7Cf043429f8fd9451b370408d537460623%7C1ce6dd9eb3374088be5e8dbbec04b34a%7C0%7C0%7C636475696241825720&amp;sdata=OroVW92iBPZ0GqneZSZfTddQsmJ1FDDGslmLN1EJQnY%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">https://churchinparliament.org/2017/05/09/general-election-2017-archbishops-issue-election-letter/</a></p>","Meriden","Dame Caroline Spelman",,"2017-11-29T16:39:44.547Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/795294/answer","Biography information for Dame Caroline Spelman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/795294/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/795294/answer",,,,,"9","Church Commissioners","Church Commissioners","2017-11-27","Christianity","1","House of Commons","To ask the Honourable Member for Meridan, representing the Church Commissioners, what steps the Church of England is taking to support Christians in the UK who face difficulties in following their faith in the (a) workplace and the (b) public forum.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","115715"

Moreover, each local authority is now legally required to publish a register of local brownfield land by 31 December 2017. These new registers will bring many more sites to the attention of house-builders and investors. However, brownfield sites differ, and not all will be available or in the right place for sustainable redevelopment. It is therefore for each local authority, in consultation with local people, to decide what land to allocate for development, as part of the Local Plan process.</p><p>The Framework sets out strong protections for Green Belt, stating that inappropriate development should be refused permission except in special circumstances. Green Belt boundary may be altered only in exceptional circumstances, using the Plan process. In the Housing White Paper, <em>Fixing our broken housing market,</em> we proposed that a local authority should be able to alter a Green Belt boundary only when it can show that it has examined all other reasonable options for meeting its development needs. Besides brownfield, the options included under-used land; optimising the density of development; and exploring whether other authorities could help. We will announce our conclusions as soon as possible in 2018.</p><p>A local authority can consider any suitable land, but should have regard to all relevant policies in the Framework. For instance, the Framework also asks local authorities to direct development away from the best and most versatile agricultural land, and to recognise the character and beauty of the countryside.</p><p> </p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma",,"2017-11-30T16:22:09.573Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/795398/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/795398/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/795398/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2017-11-27","Green Belt","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what his policy is on the use of greenbelt land in local plans when there are insufficient brownfield sites.","false","Biography information for Holly Lynch","Halifax","Holly Lynch","115819"

The learning from this will inform any future development of the draft ACO contract. NHS England has committed to consulting on the draft ACO contract before any decision is made to issue it as a contract for wider use in the National Health Service, in accordance with its duties under regulation 18 of its Standing Rules (SI 2012/2996). The consultation conducted by NHS England under regulation 18 will offer an opportunity for scrutiny of the proposed ACO contract before it is published for general use.</p><p> </p><p>To enable the draft contract to be tested NHS England has requested the Secretary of State to make amendments to a number of regulations.
