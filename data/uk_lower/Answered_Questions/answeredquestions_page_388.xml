As part of this the UK promoted the development of a new global standard for reciprocal automatic exchange of financial account information in order to effectively tackle the global problem of tax evasion. Due in large part to the UK’s leadership, over 90 countries and jurisdictions have now committed to the new global standard – known as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) – and will begin automatically exchanging information under the standard by 2017 or 2018. The receipt of large amounts of information on offshore accounts under the CRS will mark a step change in HMRC’s ability to crack down on tax evasion.</p><br /><p>During our G8 Presidency, we also drove forward the international work on country-by-country reporting (CBCR), calling on the OECD to develop a template for CBCR reporting as part of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. The OECD template is aimed at providing tax authorities with information on the global allocation of profits and taxes paid and accrued by multinationals, as well as indicators of economic activity in each country. The UK was one of the first countries to commit to implementing the OECD template for CBCR with legislation in the Finance Act 2015.</p><br /><p>The final package of measures developed under the BEPS project was published by the OECD on 5 October 2015, and endorsed by G20 Finance Ministers at their meeting on 8 October and the G20 Leaders at their summit on 15-16 November.

Play is essential for children’s development, building their confidence as they learn to explore, to think about problems, and relate to others. Children learn by leading their own play, and by taking part in play which is guided by adults.”</p><br /><p>Early Years educators and Early Years teachers are required to have an understanding of different pedagogical approaches, including the role of play in supporting early learning and development.

However, to better understand the potential risk to UK consumers the FSA produced a risk assessment in 2012 based on its survey data from 2007 of game meat samples; Veterinary Medicines Directorate data from the national surveillance scheme was also considered. The FSA risk assessment considered the potential levels of exposure to lead from lead shot game for adults, children and toddlers based on different levels of game meat consumption.</p><p>This risk assessment led to FSA issuing targeted advice to frequent consumers of lead shot game in 2012, warning of the potential risks. The advice was promoted as especially important for vulnerable groups such as toddlers and children, pregnant women and women trying for a baby, as exposure to lead can harm the developing brain and nervous system. The FSA risk assessment was published along with this advice. The Government has not estimated the number of people who regularly consume game meat shot with lead.</p><p>More generally, the FSA, works on behalf of the UK within the European Union to agree harmonised controls to reduce public exposure to lead in the food chain.

However, to better understand the potential risk to UK consumers the FSA produced a risk assessment in 2012 based on its survey data from 2007 of game meat samples; Veterinary Medicines Directorate data from the national surveillance scheme was also considered. The FSA risk assessment considered the potential levels of exposure to lead from lead shot game for adults, children and toddlers based on different levels of game meat consumption.</p><p>This risk assessment led to FSA issuing targeted advice to frequent consumers of lead shot game in 2012, warning of the potential risks. The advice was promoted as especially important for vulnerable groups such as toddlers and children, pregnant women and women trying for a baby, as exposure to lead can harm the developing brain and nervous system. The FSA risk assessment was published along with this advice. The Government has not estimated the number of people who regularly consume game meat shot with lead.</p><p>More generally, the FSA, works on behalf of the UK within the European Union to agree harmonised controls to reduce public exposure to lead in the food chain. EU maximum limits apply for lead in a range of foods and these are regularly reviewed by the EU Commission and member states.

The new contract will include improved, legally (and contractually) enforceable safeguards - including that no junior doctor working full time will be expected to work on average more than 48 hours a week, unless they opt-out of the European Working Time Directive in which case it is maximum of an average 56 hours a week. The number of hours that can be worked in any single week by any junior will be limited to 72 (down from 91 currently) and there will be a limit of five consecutive long days or four consecutive nights.</p><p>We will also bring the working hours and service delivery of junior doctors within the Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection regime. Putting patients first is the responsibility of employers and staff. Juniors must feel confident that when they raise safety concerns they are listened to. Where doctors are asked to work in conditions that they believe are unsafe, including being asked to work patterns that put patient safety at risk, they will be asked to use the reporting mechanisms available to them (including alerting their line managers/clinical supervisors, reporting through the local incident reporting system which will upload to the National Reporting and Learning System) to raise the issue with both the board of their trust, and reporting data will be available for the CQC to use during inspections. We would expect trust boards to look at any such report and decide how to respond to it; and we would expect the CQC, when it carries out an inspection, to look at how the board has responded to this and other data reporting safety incidents and concerns.</p>","Ipswich","Ben Gummer",,"2015-11-18T10:02:52.727Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427703/answer","Biography information for Ben Gummer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427703/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/427703/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-11-10","Junior Doctors: Conditions of Employment","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what assessment he has made of the potential effect of the new junior doctors' contract on patients' safety.","false","Biography information for Thangam Debbonaire","Bristol West","Thangam Debbonaire","15970"

These announcements relate to closures from March 2016 and do not affect security of supply this winter.</p><br /><p>Our priority is to ensure that British families and business have access to secure and affordable energy supplies that they can rely on. Since 2014 National Grid have had the ability to procure a Contingency Balancing Reserve (CBR), which consists of the Supplemental Balancing Reserve (SBR), where existing power stations stand by ready to generate additional electricity and the Demand Side Balancing Reserve (DSBR) where companies bid for contracts with National Grid to receive payments in return for reducing their electricity usage times of peak demand should National Grid so require. National Grid and Ofgem agree that we should retain the ability to procure CBR for the next two winters. Government supports this position and we expect confirmation later this month following an Ofgem consultation.</p><br /><p>Organisations contracted under DSBR can reduce their use of grid electricity in many ways while still remaining in operation. For example, an industrial customer could switch to a back-up generator or a supermarket chain might raise the temperature slightly on its refrigerators for a short time, using less energy but maintaining safe refrigeration levels.</p><p>National Grid’s CBR is tendered competitively keeping procurement at the lowest possible cost to consumers, whilst ensuring electricity security. The additional reserve capacity that National Grid has purchased for 2015/16 represents less than 50p a year on the average annual consumer bill.</p><br /><p>From winter 2018/19, the Capacity Market will take over as the long term solution for security of supply. The Capacity Market is a key part of our reform of the electricity market and it will drive new investment in gas and demand side capacity to help keep the lights on, as well as getting the best out of our existing power stations as we transition to a low carbon electricity future. Small-scale flexible generation such as diesel can also bid into the Capacity Market – generation that can turn on quickly has a small but important role to play in securing our electricity system. It is typically run for short periods to meet peaks of demand or local system constraints, so emission impacts can be relatively limited.</p>",,"Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth",,"2015-11-18T13:21:56.81Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426969/answer","Biography information for Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426969/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426969/answer",,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2015-11-09","Electricity Generation","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the Written Answer by Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth on 2 November (HL3058), whether the measures taken to counter the loss of generating capacity resulting from the closure of coal fired power stations will include (1) the use of small diesel generators, and (2) the closure or interruption of industrial production by industry to maintain security of supply during the coming winter; and what is their estimate of the extra costs of those measures to energy consumers and taxpayers.","false","Biography information for Lord Stoddart of Swindon",,"Lord Stoddart of Swindon","HL3456"
