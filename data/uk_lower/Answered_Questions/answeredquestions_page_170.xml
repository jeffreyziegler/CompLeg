"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/851022","Ministry of Justice","false","2018-03-07","<p>Many complex factors are linked to violence in prisons . Prominent among them is the use of drugs the debt often associated with it. Additionally, violence may be linked to membership of gangs, whilst some violence will be the result of frustration at the physical condition of the prison environment and lack of opportunities to be engaged in purposeful activity. There is only limited evidence to suggest that an increased number of prisoners in a prison (known as crowding) is a direct cause of violence. The skills of staff are more important, and play a critical role in maintaining order.</p><p> </p><p>The Secretary of State has announced a range of measures to deal with the problem of drugs in prison. They include a £14m investment in intelligence and organised crime teams; new technology to download data from illicit mobile phones, and changes to the security categorisation of prisoners who continue to commit these offences in prison.</p><p> </p><p>We are also investing in 2,500 more staff in order to deliver consistent, purposeful regimes. We are providing training to both new and existing staff to equip them to take on the new key worker role, in which they will provide more effective challenge and support to prisoners.</p><p> </p><p>Our latest published safety statistics show that levels of violence and self-harm are at record highs, which is why improving prison safety remains a top priority. Our Prison Safety Programme includes a comprehensive set of actions to address both violence and self-harm.</p><p> </p><p>We have invested in 5,600 body-worn cameras, which will provide high-quality evidence to support prosecutions brought against prisoners. They are being deployed alongside staff training to support better interaction and relationships. We have also introduced a new case management system for violent prisoners, known as the Challenge, Support and Intervention Plan.</p><p> </p><p>A comprehensive roll out of improved suicide and self-harm prevention training has already reached over 14,300 staff. We are making improvements to the support that we offer to prisoners in their early days in custody, and to the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork case management process for those identified as being at risk.

Prominent among them is the use of drugs the debt often associated with it. Additionally, violence may be linked to membership of gangs, whilst some violence will be the result of frustration at the physical condition of the prison environment and lack of opportunities to be engaged in purposeful activity. There is only limited evidence to suggest that an increased number of prisoners in a prison (known as crowding) is a direct cause of violence. The skills of staff are more important, and play a critical role in maintaining order.</p><p> </p><p>The Secretary of State has announced a range of measures to deal with the problem of drugs in prison.

We want a deal that works for all parts of the UK and we will faithfully deliver on that policy. The Joint Report also addressed the question of a fall-back option to avoid a hard border and disruption to businesses and supply chains both sides of the border if we cannot reach the deep overall agreement that we want.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The Government’s agreed proposals for the Northern Ireland border were most recently set out in the Prime Minister’s Mansion House speech. One option is for the UK to mirror the EU’s requirements for imports from the rest of the world, applying the same tariffs and the same rules of origin as the EU for those goods arriving in the UK and intended for the EU. This approach, would remove the need for customs processes at the UK-EU border. Another option would be to jointly agree to implement a range of measures to minimise frictions to trade and make specific provisions for Northern Ireland such as exempting smaller traders who would be allowed to continue to operate as they do currently, with no new restrictions. For larger traders, the proposal would be to introduce streamlined processes, including a trusted trader scheme which would be consistent with our commitments. Both of these options for our future customs arrangement would leave the UK free to determine its own tariffs with third countries - which would simply not be possible in a customs union. On goods, a fundamental principle in our negotiating strategy is that trade at the UK-EU border should be as frictionless as possible with no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We believe this can be achieved via a commitment to ensure that the relevant UK regulatory standards remain at least as high as the EU’s and a customs arrangement.</p>",,"Lord Callanan",,"2018-03-13T12:41:01.737Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/849942/answer","Biography information for Lord Callanan","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/849942/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/849942/answer",,,,,,,,"203","Exiting the European Union ","Exiting the European Union ","2018-02-26","Borders: Northern Ireland","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what specific measures they will take to address the issues with the Northern Ireland border in the withdrawal negotiations with the EU.","false","Biography information for Lord Taylor of Warwick",,"Lord Taylor of Warwick","HL5896"
