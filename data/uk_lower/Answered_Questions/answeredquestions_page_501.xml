"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50323","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2014-05-13","<p> </p><p>As I stated in my answer of 10 February 2014, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 419W, street lighting plays an important role in road safety, as well as ensuring the personal safety of pedestrians. There may be some roads where lights could be dimmed in the very early hours, saving taxpayers' money. However, this should be a local decision by elected local councillors, reflecting local circumstances – especially in relation to any concerns about crime. Equally, not every neighbourhood wants street lighting, as some communities, especially in rural areas, value dark skies.</p><p>We believe that councils should listen to the views of their local residents, and then adopt appropriate local policies based on the neighbourhood, the precise location and the usage of the road/street. I previously noted that <em>Manual for Streets</em> contains some useful guidance on getting the balance right when providing street lighting, taking into account the different issues around safety, crime prevention, street clutter and light pollution. Ultimately, there is no prescriptive Whitehall guidance, and any assessment will depend on local circumstances and local views.</p><p>Notwithstanding, I would observe that Her Majesty's Opposition seem to have a short memory about their actions on cutting street lighting when they were in office:</p><p>· <strong>Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs</strong>: When the rt. hon. Member was Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, his Department and its quangos lectured local councils to switch off or reduce street lighting to minimise carbon emissions. For example, in 2007, he personally launched the Carbon Trust Standard, which was tied to an extensive programme to reduce street lighting as part of the Local Authority Carbon Management Programme. As DEFRA Ministers told the House: “All authorities should be seeking to reduce energy usage both to cut costs and to help combat climate change. As street lighting accounts for a significant proportion of the energy used by authorities, it should be readily identified as an area that should be examined for potential efficiency savings” (6 November 2006, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 709W).</p><p>· <strong>Department for Transport</strong>: The Minister of State for Transport, the noble Lord Adonis (now a Shadow Minister for Infrastructure) when asked about reducing the hours of operation of street lighting, noted that “the Government also support the Carbon Trust's local authority carbon management programme, which provides councils with support and guidance to help them realise carbon emissions savings from street lighting” (17 December 2008, <em>Official Report</em>, House of Lords, Column WA52). Transport Ministers also endorsed the Highways Agency's ‘Efficiency Strategy for Road Lighting' which led to switching off motorway lighting at night (21 April 2008, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 1444W; Highways Agency<em>, Efficiency Strategy for Road Lighting Midnight Switch Off for Motorway Lighting</em>, 2009).</p><p>· <strong>Department for Communities and Local Government</strong>: The rt. Hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (now Shadow Home Secretary), when as Minister in the precursor department to DCLG, noted there was nuanced debate on the extent of street lighting: “We all recognise the fact that there is a series of tensions around light pollution. People in the cities will never have the same view of the night sky as one can get in the middle of Dartmoor... There can be tensions too at neighbourhood level between the security-obsessed householder who has glaring white security lights stuck to every corner of the house, which flicker on every time a little bird flies past or the cat runs across the garden, and the neighbour who... has a telescope and cannot see across the garden, let alone into the skies” (12 February 2004, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 510WH).</p><p>· <strong>Department for Energy and Climate Change</strong>: In 2008, the rt. hon. Member for Leeds Central also personally launched the Carbon Reduction Commitment, which resulted in councils cutting carbon emissions from street lighting, including dimming or switching off lights. The Highway Agency's <em>Energy Strategy for Roadside Equipment</em> (April 2010) explained that the approach of “dimming, trimming and partial night lighting” was a consequence of the requirements to meet the Carbon Reduction Commitment. As DECC Ministers said to the House: “DECC is working to include street lighting in the Carbon Reduction Commitment. This will provide an incentive for local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of street lights. DECC is working closely with Communities and Local Government to develop the policy, in so far as it relates to local authorities” (19 June 2009, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 515W). Of course, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change at that time was the rt. hon. Member for Doncaster North, now Leader of HM Opposition.</p><p>I hope this illuminates the historical fogginess of the Labour Party's current campaign on municipal street lighting. I would suggest the last person out of Labour HQ tonight should turn off the lights.</p><p> </p>","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis",,"2014-05-13T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50323/answer","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50323/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50323/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-05-08",,"1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what assessment he has made of the link between (a) street and (b) ambient lighting and the incidence of burglaries.","false","Biography information for Hilary Benn","Leeds Central","Hilary Benn","198177"

However, we applaud the work of the GFI and the work it is doing to improve the health and social care provisions for incontinence, giving patients and care givers a better quality of life.</p><p> </p><p>Responsibility for continence services sit with NHS England and clinical commissioning groups (CCG). CCGs are responsible for commissioning high quality continence services based on an assessment of local need and performance managing their providers in the delivery of high quality services.</p><p> </p><p>The Mandate to NHS England requires it to deliver continued improvements in relation to enhancing the quality of life for people with long-term conditions, including those suffering incontinence, across the five domains of the NHS Outcomes Framework. NHS England will be taking forward a major programme of work through the Primary Care Strategy; it has established a working group on continence care and will provide an update for the All Party Parliamentary Group for Continence Care on 24 June.</p><p> </p><p>To improve standards in continence care, the Department commissioned the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to develop clinical guidelines on the management of urinary incontinence in women (issued in 2006) and faecal incontinence in adults (issued in 2007), which are supported by commissioning tools to support CCGs. In February, NICE published a clinical Quality Standard on Faecal Incontinence, QS54, which describes high-priority areas for quality improvement in this area.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50124","Northern Ireland Office","false","2014-05-14","<p> </p><p>The information provided in my written answer of 1 May 2014 (Official Report, Column 762W) was based on information held by my Department. I first became aware of the issue of missing files while preparing to answer that question. I directed that a review take place, along with other relevant Departments, of the historical records relating to RPMs during the period 1987 to 1997. This is ongoing.</p><p>Records indicate that the vast majority of uses of the RPM referred to in my answer of 1 May did not relate to terrorist offences. Historically, the RPM was used to remit sentences of individuals before statutory means existed to do so. This included releasing individuals from prison for compassionate reasons (e.g. those who were terminally ill), individuals who assisted the police and prosecuting authorities (now provided for by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005), or to correct errors in calculating release dates. Further information on the general operation of the RPM can be found in the Ministry of Justice's “Review of the Executive Royal Prerogative Powers: Final Report”, published in October 2009.</p><p>In a written answer to the Member for North West Norfolk on 17 March 2014 (Official Report, Column 368W), I repeated an answer given on 20 March 2003 by the then-Secretary for State for Northern Ireland to the Member for Lagan Valley (Official Report, Column 895W) – namely that 18 individuals had been granted the RPM in relation to terrorist offences since 1998. Given the RPM has not been used since 2002 and has not been used by this Government, the answer given was the same as the 2003 one. However, early findings from the review of files have indicated that at least one of these cases did not relate to a terrorist offence and in one other case the records do not indicate whether or not the offence was terrorism related.</p><p>In relation to the remaining 16 uses of the RPM between 2000 and 2002 (which did concern terrorist offences), I understand that previous Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland used the RPM in relation to individuals who for technical reasons fell outside of the letter of the Early Release Scheme, to shorten (i.e. not waive or remove) sentences in order that individuals fell within what I understand the then-Government saw as the spirit of the Scheme.</p><p>In other words, the RPM was used to correct what the last Government viewed as discrepancies between the letter and the intention of the Belfast Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act – that for a certain category of terrorist offences, offenders could be released after serving two years of their sentences.</p><p>The reasons for exercising the RPM in the 16 terrorism-related cases are summarised as follows:</p><p>· to correct an anomaly in the treatment of an offender convicted of the same offence(s) and given the same sentence as co-defendants but who would otherwise have served longer in prison;</p><p>· to release prisoners who would have been eligible for early release under the Belfast Agreement had they not transferred to a different jurisdiction;</p><p>· to release prisoners who would have been eligible to be released under the Belfast Agreement had they not served sentences outside the jurisdiction having been convicted extraterritorially, or</p><p>· to release prisoners who would have been eligible to be released under the Belfast Agreement had their offences (which subsequently became scheduled offences) been scheduled at the time they were committed.</p><p>The names of the 16 individuals granted the RPM in relation to terrorist offences since 2000 are currently being considered as part of an ongoing court case in Northern Ireland.</p><p> </p>","Chipping Barnet","Mrs Theresa Villiers",,"2014-05-14T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50124/answer","Biography information for Theresa Villiers","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50124/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50124/answer","Chipping Barnet","Mrs Theresa Villiers","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/50124/answer/previousversion/9585","Biography information for Theresa Villiers","21","Northern Ireland","Northern Ireland","2014-05-07",,"1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, how many of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy certificates issued by her Department in the last 30 years have been issued to people accused of terrorism-related offences.","false","Biography information for Ian Paisley","North Antrim","Ian Paisley","198119"
