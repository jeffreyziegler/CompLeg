A key focus has been to work closely with the investment industry on initiatives involving both institutional investors and asset managers, acknowledging that while some institutional investors engage directly with companies, many others delegate to asset managers to engage on their behalf.</p><p>Specific achievements include:</p><ul><li>a strengthening of the Stewardship Code to emphasise engagement on companies’ long-term strategy;</li><li>the creation of an Investor Forum to improve the amount and effectiveness of collective engagement by key institutional investors;</li><li>the development, by the National Association of Pension Funds, of a new Stewardship Disclosure Framework to encourage asset managers to report on their activities and to enable investors to hold them to account.</li></ul><p> </p><p>The Government has comprehensively reformed the legislative framework for corporate reporting to boost transparency on company directors’ remuneration and ensure annual reports are more focused on long-term company strategy. In this way we are encouraging companies to report the information which is relevant to long-term stewardship investors.</p><p>The Law Commission’s report on the fiduciary duties of investment intermediaries, commissioned by the Government, concluded that fiduciary investors such as pension scheme trustees should consider whether and how to engage with companies to promote their long-term success, either directly or through their investment managers. The Government is now taking forward the Law Commission’s recommendations in a number of areas, including by consulting currently on whether the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations 2005 should be amended to require trustees to state their policy on stewardship with reference to the Stewardship Code.</p><p>This work has been part of a broader commitment – in response to the Kay Review of equity markets - to address the longstanding concern that short-termism has impeded the creation of sustainable value by British companies. The Government published a comprehensive progress report on the implementation of the Review in October 2014.

This emphasises that schools should have a designated senior lead, with responsibility for the handling of safeguarding concerns, in place. Where schools have immediate concerns about the risk of suicide, an immediate referral should be made to children’s social care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Schools can also play an important role in identifying mental health issues early and ensuring that pupils get support to prevent problems from escalating. One in ten children has a diagnosable mental health disorder and the Government is committed to improving support for these young people. The Department for Education is taking action to tackle the stigma around mental health, promote positive wellbeing, and to ensure pupils have the support and knowledge that they need to keep themselves healthy and safe.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In order to support schools, the Department is publishing new guidance for both primary and secondary schools. This guidance is produced in conjunction with the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHE). This will help them to provide age-appropriate teaching on a range of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression and self-harm. We are also updating the Mental Health and Behaviour guidance for schools, first published in June 2014<a title="" href="http://3dcpri-papp09/new_parliamentaryquestion/228146-%20Jim%20Shannon/Draft/228146%20-%20QA%20-%20200315.docx#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This is to ensure that current advice and guidance on supporting pupils mental health needs is reflected. The guidance helps schools to identify and support those with more severe needs and to make appropriate referrals to specialist mental health services. The ‘Future in Mind’ report, published on 17 March 2015<a title="" href="http://3dcpri-papp09/new_parliamentaryquestion/228146-%20Jim%20Shannon/Draft/228146%20-%20QA%20-%20200315.docx#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a>, set out a clear set of ambitions for improving access to specialist mental health support for children and young people. Later this year we will be piloting joint training for points of contact in specialist mental health services and schools across 15 Clinical Commissioning Group areas; this will improve knowledge and referrals, so that pupils get the support they need more quickly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many schools already provide pupils with access to counselling services, providing children and young people with safe environments where they can discuss problems and receive support. The Department is publishing new guidance for primary and secondary schools on how to deliver good quality school-based counselling services to support their pupils.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department knows that children and young people who are persistently bullied are more likely to suffer from poor mental health and emotional wellbeing. It is for this reason that we have made tackling bullying in schools a top priority. All schools must have a behaviour policy with measures to tackle bullying.

The Department expects trusts to have a strong grip on their finances, and manage their contract and agency staffing spend (including use of locums) responsibly through effective and efficient workforce planning and management and to minimise temporary staffing costs in future years.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To support the NHS to reduce agency spend, we are working to improve the deployment of the existing employed nursing workforce, for example, through spreading good practice in use of electronic rostering; improve workforce planning and supply to ensure we achieve safe staffing levels through better recruitment and retention including, for example, supporting nurses who want to “Return to Practice”. In addition , we are working to reduce the cost of agency staff by, where it is possible and appropriate, requiring the NHS to use existing frameworks (e.g. trusts receiving financial help under the Health and Social Care Act 2012) so they can secure agency staff at market rates.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><p> </p><p>The figures reported by FTs were different in definition from those collected from other organisations before 2012-13, and were different in status. FTs published figures for “Agency/contract” expenditure in their annual audited accounts. Other organisations did not provide this level of detail in their audited accounts, but reported expenditure on “Non-NHS Staff” in annual Financial Returns. These returns followed on after the accounts and were reconciled to them, but were not part of the audited accounts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Financial Returns were discontinued in 2013 to reduce the burden on the NHS. At the same time, the definition was aligned with FTs as “Agency/contract”. Excluded from the “Agency/Contract” category are costs of staff recharged by another organisation where no element of overhead is included i.e. where the staff costs are shared between the NHS trust and other bodies; staff on secondment or on loan from other organisations; amounts payable to contractors in respect of the provision of services (for example, cleaning or security).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The figure for 2009-10 includes primary care trusts (PCTs). PCTs provided significant amounts of patient services (in 2010, 19% of NHS nurses were employed by PCTs), and most of these services have transferred into trusts. It is not possible to separate out PCT expenditure between provider and commissioner costs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For the first time, the Department collected unaudited financial data from NHS trusts for 2013/14 on Contract and Agency staffing costs and income to give a net expenditure figure.
