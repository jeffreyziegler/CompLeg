Their latest report states: “Most providers (91%) continue to report that the current level of arrears, rent collection and voids are within or outperforming their business plans” (<em>Quarterly Survey of Private Registered Providers 2014-15, Quarter 1</em>); the reports paint a broad picture of stability in income collection.</p><p> </p><p>In this context, the claims previously made by HM Opposition about the effects of the removal of the spare room subsidy were unfounded. The removal of the spare room subsidy is estimated to save £490 million of taxpayers' money in Great Britain in 2013-14, reducing the housing benefit bill and helping pay off the budget deficit left by the last Administration. The measure also encourages the more effective use of social housing, by addressing the under-occupation of family homes.</p>","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis","207915 ; 207989","2014-09-18T16:22:54.2728714Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90436/answer","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90436/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90436/answer","Keighley","Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90436/answer/previousversion/18926","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-09-03","Social Rented Housing: Warrington","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what estimate he has made of the rent arrears accrued by each registered social landlord in (a) Warrington and (b) Warrington North constituency in each year since 2010.","false","Biography information for Helen Jones","Warrington North","Helen Jones","208072"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90358","Ministry of Justice","false","2014-09-11","<p /> <p /> <p>I refer the Rt hon. Member to the answer my predecessor gave in June. We do not centrally hold data on the number of prisoners transferred from closed to open prisons for the time period requested or the time left to serve at the point of recategorisation and allocation to the open estate. Consequently, the information requested could be obtained only at disproportionate cost, as it would involve a manual trawl through the records of every prisoner transferred to an open prison in the last year to identify if they were over two years from their earliest release date at the point of recategorisation and then allocation to an open prison.</p><p> </p><p>Two years is considered to be the maximum time a prisoner should spend in open conditions. However, assessment of a prisoner’s individual risks and needs may support earlier categorisation to open conditions. Such cases must have the reasons for their categorisation fully documented and confirmed in writing by the Governing Governor.</p><p> </p><p>Categorisation and allocation to open prison is never an automatic progression. Public protection is foremost in the decision making process. Only prisoners who have successfully completed offending behaviour work essential to their risk reduction and whose risks are manageable in conditions of low security will be allocated to an open prison.</p><p /> <p>The earliest date on which an indeterminate sentence prisoner may be released from custody is on completion of his “tariff” – that is, the minimum period to be served in custody, as determined by the Court, for the purposes of retribution and deterrence. These prisoners do not have fixed release dates, so even if the data on transfers was readily available, it would not be possible to identify a length of time left to be served in these cases. The vast majority of indeterminate sentence prisoners will be transferred to open conditions only on a positive recommendation from the independent Parole Board. Where they can show that they have made exceptional progress and where there are no known or documented concerns about their risk of harm or risk of abscond, they may be transferred without a positive recommendation from the Parole Board.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-09-11T16:13:42.0161887Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90358/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90358/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/90358/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-09-02","Prisoners' Release","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prisoners re-categorised as suitable for Category D who were over two years from their earliest release date were sent to open conditions in the last year.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","207933"

September 2014 figure rounded to the nearest thousand.</sub></p><p>A rising number of homes progressing towards a start is a positive indicator of increasing housing construction. Contrary to the incorrect claims of the Labour Party, it is not a measure of “land banking” nor is it “houses where nothing is happening”, rather it is a reflection of the detailed work being undertaken, red tape being navigated and finance being raised in order to turn a council planning permission into a construction site.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Action to kick-start house building</em></p><p>Steps we have or are taking to get stalled sites moving include:</p><p> </p><p>· Introducing measures in the Infrastructure Bill to reduce bureaucracy on implementing planning conditions after planning permission has been granted.</p><p> </p><p>· Implementing the recommendations of the Penfold Review to consolidate the overlapping and confusing regime of non-planning consents, on top of planning permission.</p><p> </p><p>· Allowing developers to review economically unrealistic Section 106 agreements, through the Growth and Infrastructure Act. Such unrealistic agreements result in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits: a sensible review can result in more housing and more affordable housing.</p><p> </p><p>· Ending the temporary measure (introduced by the last Administration) which allowed developers to roll forward their planning permissions; this ending of the measure has now increased the incentive for developers to start on site before their permission expires.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Investment we have provided includes:</p><p> </p><p>· The Get Britain Building investment fund, providing over £500 million of finance which has so far helped start over 12,000 new homes on stalled sites.</p><p> </p><p>· The Growing Places Fund is providing £730 million to deliver the infrastructure needed to unlock stalled schemes that will promote economic growth, create jobs and build homes. This is supporting approximately 70,000 new housing units, as well as significant amounts of extra commercial and industrial floor space.</p><p><br>· The £474 million Local Infrastructure Fund investment fund is supporting the delivery of upfront infrastructure for locally-supported, large-scale housing sites and commercial development; it also provides capacity funding and brokerage support to local authorities to help them progress major schemes through the planning process. Nearly 90,000 homes have been unlocked, so far.</p><p><br>· The £3 million Site Delivery Fund is being made available to 66 local planning authorities to accelerate starts on site</p><p><br>· The £525 million Builders' Finance Fund is assisting small and medium-sized developers to access finance to support the delivery of housing schemes of between 15 and 250 units, helping kick-start stalled sites and deliver around 15,000 units over four years.</p><p><br>· Growth Deals with 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships are providing £6 billion of funding over six years (including over £3 billion for projects starting in 2015-16), all with substantial implications for house building. Over the lifetime of Growth Deals (six years), it is estimated the investment will unlock the land or finance for more than 150,000 homes, just from the projects that will start next year in 2015-16.</p><p><br>- In addition, we are taking forward a comprehensive programme to sell surplus and redundant public sector land and property, freeing up taxpayers’ money and providing land for new homes.</p><p><br><br></p><p> </p><p>Taken together, these indicators show that the Government’s long-term economic plan is working and turning around the mess and recession left by the last Labour Government. Moth-balled sites are springing into action; more homes are being planned; and more homes are being built out.</p><p> </p><p>However, the policy solutions now being advocated by HM Opposition would actually have an adverse effect in reducing house building. If developers fear new development taxes or state confiscation of land, they will be less willing to undertake complex land assembly projects; they will let their existing planning permissions lapse; and they will simply be more cautious in applying for planning permission in the first place.

While in Service, our personnel can receive skills, qualifications and experience accredited to nationally recognised standards to ease the transition back into the civilian workplace. <br><br>The MOD and the Department for Education have worked closely together on the Troops for Teachers Programme. This is a coherent programme that Service leavers can use to access teaching opportunities to increase the number of high-quality Service leavers joining the teaching profession. The MOD and the Career Transition Partnership (CTP) (the MOD’s employment support partner for personnel leaving the Armed Forces) promote the programme through various channels including CTP organised career events for Service personnel; through internal Defence media (such as the Defence Intranet); and through resettlement briefings which take place at CTP centres across the UK. The CTP continues to be successful. Of those personnel who access the CTP, 85% are in employment within six months of them leaving the Armed Forces.<br><br>The new two-year, school-based Troops to Teachers programme started in January 2014 and has been designed and developed together with a group of outstanding schools and initial teacher training providers and with the CTP. It uses a rigorous assessment, selection and recruitment process to identify those Service leavers with the potential to become outstanding teachers. This process also recognises the professional skills Service leavers already have and provides training to make best use of and further develop them in schools. Good progress was made in recruiting 41 eligible Service leavers for the first cohort of this scheme.
