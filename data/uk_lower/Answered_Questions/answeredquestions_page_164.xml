Thanks to the Government reforms and the hard work of teachers across the country, 154,000 more six year olds are on track to become fluent readers, and international evidence has shown that our nine year olds have achieved their highest ever scores in reading. In 2017, 82% of children in Essex passed the phonics screening check, slightly above the national average. Schools in Essex are benefitting from funding to support school improvement in reading outcomes for boys in primary and secondary schools, and to improve the teaching of phonics in primary schools.</p><p>The Department wants to build on these successes by supporting teachers to further raise standards for all children. We have announced that we will set up a new Centre of Excellence for Literacy Teaching and a national network of 35 English Hubs across the country.

Around 40% of calls now receive clinical input, the highest it has ever been and wherever possible, the caller will have their health issue dealt with there and then over the phone by the clinician without the need to go to another NHS service.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, the National Institute for Health Research are undertaking a study to consider the impact of alcohol related attendances at A&amp;E departments.

We do not routinely collect data on the number or size of individuals’ pension pots, but it is clear that many of these pots will be small at this early stage. However, the proposals announced in the 2017 Review of Automatic Enrolment will mean pension saving starting from a younger age, which we know makes a real difference. A National Minimum Wage earner who starts saving from 22 could build a pot of £82,000 (in today’s earnings terms) by state pension age. Had they started saving at 18, that pot could be £92,000 (12 per cent larger).
