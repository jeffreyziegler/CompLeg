The Compact will not in any way create legal obligations for States, nor does it seek to establish international customary law or further interpret existing treaties or national obligations. It does not establish a ‘human right to migrate’ or create any new legal categories of migrant. The GCM emphasises that migrants are entitled to the same universal human rights as any human being and does not create any new ‘rights’ for migrants.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Compact commits to protecting freedom of expression for the press and public. The freedom of the media to debate all issues of importance to society, including the issue of migration in all its aspects, is fundamental to a liberal society and the UK Government attaches the highest importance to this.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It also includes proposals which will help the UK make a strong contribution to the delivery of the global Sustainable Development Goals.

The Secretary of State announced the UK’s support for the Migration Compact at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018, and Minister Burt attended the intergovernmental launch event in Marrakesh in December 2018.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Well-managed migration is in everyone’s interests. But uncontrolled migration erodes public confidence, damages economies, and places people on the move in situations of great vulnerability. The UK is taking significant steps to tackle uncontrolled migration both in our domestic policy work and in our ODA-funded programmes by:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Addressing factors that may force people to migrate irregularly, through our targeted assistance for livelihoods, healthcare, and education and driving economic development;</li><li>Tackling modern slavery and organised immigration crime;</li><li>Supporting enhanced border management;</li><li>Providing critical humanitarian support and protection for vulnerable migrants, as well as offering voluntary return and vital reintegration support to those wishing to return home; and</li><li>Supporting refugees to stay in a first safe country through our humanitarian and development work in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Global Compact for Migration supports delivery of these efforts within the international system and enhances cooperation between states without affecting the sovereignty of all countries to control their own borders. The Compact will not in any way create legal obligations for States, nor does it seek to establish international customary law or further interpret existing treaties or national obligations. It does not establish a ‘human right to migrate’ or create any new legal categories of migrant. The GCM emphasises that migrants are entitled to the same universal human rights as any human being and does not create any new ‘rights’ for migrants.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Compact commits to protecting freedom of expression for the press and public. The freedom of the media to debate all issues of importance to society, including the issue of migration in all its aspects, is fundamental to a liberal society and the UK Government attaches the highest importance to this.

The Withdrawal Agreement ensures that the UK’s membership of the EU, and the CJEU’s jurisdiction in the UK, is wound down in a sensible and orderly way. In keeping with this, and in the interests of ensuring citizens’ rights are interpreted consistently, the UK has agreed that a very narrow group of issues will be able to be referred to the CJEU for an interpretation, having due regard to whether relevant case law already exists.</p><p>For questions that relate to the settled status of EU citizens, UK courts will be able to refer questions of interpretation to the CJEU eight years from exit day, because settled status applications will be made from exit day. They will be able to refer questions that relate to other aspects of the citizens’ rights part of the agreement for eight years from the end of the implementation period, as those other aspects will only apply from the end of the implementation period.</p><p>In practical terms, this is a very limited role: our courts currently only refer two or three of this kind of case to the CJEU every year.</p><p> </p>","Worcester","Mr Robin Walker",,"2019-01-08T11:22:52.74Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1027555/answer","Biography information for Mr Robin Walker","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1027555/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1027555/answer",,,,,"203","Exiting the European Union ","Exiting the European Union ","2018-12-18","Immigration: EU Nationals","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, when the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over the rights of EU citizens will end.","false","Biography information for Keith Vaz","Leicester East","Keith Vaz","203244"
