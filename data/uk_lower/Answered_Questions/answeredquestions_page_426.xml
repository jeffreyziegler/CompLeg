Government is helping industry to realise these opportunities through initiatives such as the government-funded Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC) and the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS), which have been established to support UK companies in accessing the market, winning business and growing capability.</p><p>In addition to nuclear, the Department is supporting a range of technologies in the renewables sector to develop further the UK’s low carbon economy and create a balanced and secure energy mix for the future. This is done by encouraging investment and working closely with industry to build a UK supply chain; we are world-leaders in offshore wind, with an industry that has attracted £9.5bn investment since 2010 and supports over 13,700 jobs.
