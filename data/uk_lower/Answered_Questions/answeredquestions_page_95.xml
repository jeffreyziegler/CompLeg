These provide statistical allocations of public spending according to where the benefits of that spend are accrued, although the complexity of transport networks means that it is not always possible or appropriate to allocate transport spending on a ‘who benefits’ basis. Where this is the case, expenditure has been apportioned based on actual regional spend rather than where the benefit lies. This is particularly relevant for the rail network and highways.</p><p> </p><p>When comparing expenditure across regions a number of factors should be considered. The benefits from spend on transport interventions will often accrue to people far beyond the residents of the immediate local area or region. This is particularly the case for spending on the railways which connect cities and regions across the country and deliver broader benefits beyond the region concerned. In addition, when expenditure is presented on a “per head of population” (or “per capita”) basis, it does not account for the pressure that large numbers of commuters and visitors from outside of a region can add to the transport networks.</p><p> </p><p>The latest CRA statistics, published by HM Treasury on 20th November 2018, include total public expenditure on transport per capita on a regional basis from 2013-14 up to 2017-18, and are published at:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-and-regional-analysis" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-and-regional-analysis</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The statistics include spend on transport by all public sector organisations including the Department for Transport, Local Authorities, Public Corporations (in the case of transport, this is mainly spend by London Underground) and other Government Departments including devolved administrations.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The Department for Transport does not allocate funding to transport on a ‘per head of population’ basis.

Pupils with identified SEN accounted for 46.7% of all permanent exclusions and 44.9% of fixed period exclusions.</p><p>In March, the government launched an externally led review of exclusions practice, led by Edward Timpson CBE. The review will consider how schools use exclusion and how this affects all pupils, but in particular why some groups of children, such as those with special needs, are more likely to be excluded from school. The government will respond to this review after it is published at the beginning of 2019.</p><p>The attached full terms of reference for the review can be found here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-exclusions-review-terms-of-reference" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-exclusions-review-terms-of-reference</a>.</p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton",,"2018-12-05T12:51:14.213Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1012148/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1012148/answer","A_Review_of_School_Exclusion_Terms_Of_Reference.pdf","A_Review_of_School_Exclusion_Terms_Of_Reference.pdf","A_Review_of_School_Exclusion_Terms_Of_Reference","A_Review_of_School_Exclusion_Terms_Of_Reference","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1012148/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-11-21","Pupil Exclusions: Special Educational Needs","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the number of children with special needs being excluded from school, the implications for their education, and the risk of such children being vulnerable to involvement in anti-social behaviour as a result.","false","Biography information for Lord Ouseley",,"Lord Ouseley","HL11675"
