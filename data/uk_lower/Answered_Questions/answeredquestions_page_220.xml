The UK’s current trading commitments to other WTO members, such as the tariffs it sets on goods they export to the UK, are applied through the EU’s schedules of commitments. As we leave the EU these will have to be set out separately for the UK.</p><p> </p><p>The proposals in the letter cover how the UK’s commitments should be calculated. We are working to ensure the UK schedule replicates as far as possible existing trade flows. The UK aims to extract its share of trade commitments and entitlements from the EU schedule, including agricultural tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) and domestic support. The TRQs apply to a range of everyday items such as dairy products and meat.</p><p> </p><p>The proposal is that the quotas for the EU 27 and UK are apportioned based on existing trade flows. Apportioning TRQs will ensure there is limited disruption to existing overall quotas. Using historic trade flows under the EU’s TRQs as a reference will maintain current levels of foreign market access. The total future quota amounts scheduled at the WTO by the EU 27 and the UK will therefore equal the current amounts in the EU schedule.</p><p> </p><p>Upon EU exit, the UK will no longer be a member of the EU's Single Market or Customs Union. Therefore, regardless of any implementation period, the UK would still need to have established its own independent schedules at the WTO as it leaves the EU. These should be ready on day one of EU exit to protect UK trade interests and minimise the disruption to global trade.</p><p> </p><p>The UK and the EU are committed to engaging with the WTO Membership in a spirit of cooperation, inclusiveness and openness on these matters over the course of the coming weeks and months.</p>",,"Lord Gardiner of Kimble",,"2017-10-30T16:06:21.547Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/772397/answer","Biography information for Lord Gardiner of Kimble","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/772397/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/772397/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2017-10-17","Agricultural Products: Import Duties","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what understanding they have reached with the EU on sharing out the tariff-rate quotas that govern the import of farm products into the EU from countries outside the bloc; when they anticipate those changes will come into effect; and what effect the proposed sharing out will have on overall quotas registered with the World Trade Organisation.","false","Biography information for Lord Allen of Kensington",,"Lord Allen of Kensington","HL2090"

Sanctions play a crucial role in this strategy. UN Security Council Resolution 2270 (March 2016) introduced broader economic sanctions on the DPRK that aim to restrict major sources of revenue used by the DPRK regime to fund its illegal weapons programmes. UNSCRs 2371 (August 2017) and 2375 (September 2017) expanded these sanctions to include sectoral restrictions on the DPRK’s trade in coal, iron, lead, textiles, crude and refined oil, and overseas workers. It has been less than three months since the UN Security Council agreed to the full coal ban, which marked the first sector-wide ban on exports from the DPRK. The first UN Panel of Experts report on implementation of those sanctions will be released in January, with member state implementation reports due on 3 November. Sanctions take time to have effect, but there are early indications of their impact. The Chinese Central Bank has instructed all Chinese banks to comply with UN resolutions, and Chinese businesses were recently given 120 days to divest themselves of joint ventures with DPRK companies. Other countries are also playing their part, for example by restricting visas for DPRK overseas workers or prohibiting all trade with the DPRK. The EU has introduced a raft of measures that go beyond the UN-mandated sanctions, such as an oil ban and reducing the ceiling on hard currency remittances to the DPRK by two-thirds.</p>",,"Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon",,"2017-10-31T17:00:57.043Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/771200/answer","Biography information for Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/771200/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/771200/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2017-10-16","North Korea: Sanctions","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what is their evaluation of the effectiveness of sanctions imposed on North Korea.","false","Biography information for Lord Alton of Liverpool",,"Lord Alton of Liverpool","HL2001"

Increased intensity of work search under Universal Credit. Conditionality is extended under UC to certain groups that were not subject to conditionality under the legacy system, meaning they will get work coach support and encouragement to seek work, and will sign a claimant commitment to spend up to 35 hours (depending on their circumstances and any caring responsibilities) a week seeking work.</p><p> </p><p>The conditionality regime in Universal Credit has a wider reach than the equivalent JSA regime in the legacy benefit system. We use evidence of the employment impacts from trials of labour market interventions to estimate the increase in employment for these groups experiencing conditionality for the first time. We estimate that extended conditionality under UC will result in around 50,000 additional people moving into employment.</p><p> </p><p>3. A smoother and simpler transition into work under Universal Credit. Universal Credit places less administrative burden on the claimant and has a clearer system of allowances and tapers that allow claimants to more easily see the financial benefits of moving into work or increasing their hours.</p><p> </p><p>The estimated employment impacts of UC due to its simplicity are based on research and evaluation evidence of similar reforms in the past. In particular, it draws on evidence from the:</p><p>a) quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mandatory work-focused interviews for lone parents and Better Off Calculations; and</p><p>b) evaluation of In-Work Credit.</p><p> </p><p>We estimated that the move to a single system of working-age benefits, in the form of Universal Credit, will result in around 60,000 more people in employment under UC in steady state.</p>",,"Baroness Buscombe",,"2017-10-30T17:32:04.62Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/771219/answer","Biography information for Baroness Buscombe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/771219/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/771219/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2017-10-16","Universal Credit","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government, further to the remarks by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on 9 October (HC Deb, col 4), whether they will publish the evidence supporting his statement that the roll-out of Universal Credit will mean that 250,000 more people will be in work.","false","Biography information for The Lord Bishop of Durham",,"The Lord Bishop of Durham","HL2020"
