No one should ever have to sleep rough. That is why last summer we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy. This sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now, but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all. The Government has now committed over £1.2 billion to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over the spending review period.</p><p>The Rough Sleeping Initiative (RSI) does not ‘allocate’ bed spaces and specialist support staff to local authorities, but funds based on the bids that the local authorities themselves submitted (in some cases with the support of our expert rough sleeping advisers). We recognise that rough sleeping impacts different areas in different ways, and so we work to ensure local areas can respond flexibly to the unique challenges they face.</p><p>Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, in conjunction with Doncaster and Rotherham, was successful in bidding for RSI funding in 2019/20. They have been allocated £328,038 this year for the staff and services detailed below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong> Intervention </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Funding </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3 rough sleeping prevention workers</p></td><td><p>£114,117</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1.5 mental health practitioners</p></td><td><p>£78,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Enhanced outreach services</p></td><td><p>£83,531</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rough Sleeping Coordinator</p></td><td><p>£52,390</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Total RSI funding for 2019/20</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>£</strong> <strong>328,038</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Overall this funding is expected to provide at least 8 additional staff across these areas.</p><p>The remaining authority in South Yorkshire, Sheffield, was allocated £363,309 in 2018/19, and £412,926 in 2019/20 through the RSI. This funding is expected to provide a total of 37 additional bed spaces and 9 staff over the two years. As a whole South Yorkshire is expected to deliver 37 bed spaces and at least 17 staff through the RSI in its first two years.</p><p>In its first year, RSI funding provided over 1,750 new bed spaces and 500 staff across the country. This year we have expanded the initiative with an investment of £46 million providing funding for an estimated 2,600 bed spaces and 750 staff. £12 million of this is for areas new to the programme, bringing the total authorities funded to 246.</p><p>More information can be found on the gov.uk website: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/james-brokenshire-confirms-funding-to-help-people-off-the-streets" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/james-brokenshire-confirms-funding-to-help-people-off-the-streets</a></p>","South Derbyshire","Mrs Heather Wheeler",,"2019-06-10T15:58:31.27Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1128485/answer","Biography information for Mrs Heather Wheeler","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1128485/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1128485/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2019-05-23","Sleeping Rough","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, how many (a) new bed spaces and (b) specialist support staff have been allocated (i) to Barnsley, (ii) to South Yorkshire and (c) nationally under the Rough Sleeping Initiative since its implementation.","false","Biography information for Stephanie Peacock","Barnsley East","Stephanie Peacock","257800"

The Serious Violence Strategy sets out the Government’s approach, which depends on a multi-agency approach working across several sectors and stresses the importance of early intervention to tackle the root causes.</p><p>Since launching the Strategy in April last year, we have progressed in deliver-ing on our key commitments which support early intervention and prevention <br>including: <br>• delivery of the Early Intervention Youth Fund of £22m which is supporting 29 projects in England and Wales, with over £4m of funding to <br>London projects including a Pan London rescue and response county lines project which targets young people up to the age of 25 who are <br>being exploited, or at risk of exploitation, through county lines;<br>• delivery of the anti-knife crime Community Fund which provided £1.5m in 2018/19 to support 68 projects, with a continued focus on local multi-strand partnership approach to tackling serious violence. The Immediate Theatre, Hackney received £30k from the 2018/19 Fund to deliver <br>positive community activities to people living in an area of high crime; and <br>• delivery of the national knife crime media campaign – #knifefree - to raise awareness of the consequences of knife crime.</p><p>In addition, on 1 April we launched a public consultation on a new legal duty to support a ‘public health’ multi-agency approach to preventing and tackling serious violence. This statutory duty would make serious violence a top priority for all key partners, ensuring that they are working together to prevent young people being caught in the criminal cycle. The consultation, closes on 28 May, can be found on the Gov.UK website at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?departments%5B%5D=home-office&amp;publication_filter_option=consultations" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?departments%5B%5D=home-office&amp;publication_filter_option=consultations</a></p><p>On 13 March the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further £100m funding in 2019/20 to help in the police’s immediate response to the rise in serious knife crime, enabling priority forces to immediately begin planning to put in place the additional capacity they need. £63.4m of this funding has already been allocated to 18 police forces worst affected by serious violence to pay for surge operational activity, such as increased patrols. This includes £20.84m to the Metropolitan Police Service. £35m of this Serious Violence Fund will support the setting up of Violence Reduction Units (VRUs) and associated preventative activity in areas most affected by serious violence.</p><p>In October 2018 the Home Secretary announced a ten-year £200m Youth Endowment Fund, focused on targeted early intervention with those children and young people most vulnerable to involvement in serious violence. This will form an important part of the multi-agency, public health; approach to serious violence.</p><p>On 1 April 2019 the Prime Minister hosted a Serious Youth Violence Summit at 10 Downing Street, with the support of the Home Secretary and Secretaries of State. The central aim of the summit was to ensure a shared understanding and commitment to a multi-agency, ‘public health’ approach to tackling knife crime and serious violence more generally. An outcome of the Summit is the creation of a new Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Prime Minister, to drive cross-government action.

We will support the development of the infrastructure for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, recognising that the market is at an early stage of development. We are doing this through initiatives such as the £23m Hydrogen for Transport programme, which will increase the uptake of fuel cell electric vehicles and expand hydrogen refuelling infrastructure.</p><p> </p><p>The Government set out its view on the relative environmental performance of different fuels in the Road to Zero Strategy. This was based on an independently verified assessment of the fuels and technologies available to consumers, with consideration given to both greenhouse gas and air-pollutant emissions over the period to 2050. This analysis suggests that hydrogen fuel cell technology could have a role in supporting the transition to zero emission transport alongside battery electric technology.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1128342","Department for Work and Pensions","false","2019-06-10","<p>The Government recognises the importance of safeguarding the welfare of claimants who have incurred debt. Under Universal Credit there is a structured approach to deductions from benefit, which simplifies the current complex arrangements. Claimants can view their Universal credit statement online and easily understand both how their award is calculated and what debts are being repaid, supporting them to manage their financial obligations.</p><p> </p><p>The aim of the deductions policy in Universal Credit is to protect vulnerable claimants by providing a last resort repayment method for arrears of essential services. The policy also enables social obligations to be enforced when other repayment methods have failed, or are not cost effective, and ensures that benefit debt is recovered in a cost effective manner.</p><p> </p><p>Regulations protect claimants from excessive deductions, which could lead to financial difficulty.</p><p> </p><p>Universal Credit is made up of a standard allowance plus any additional elements that apply, for example a housing element or child element. The overall maximum amount that can be deducted for debt repayments from a claimant’s Universal Credit each month is an amount equal to 40 per cent of their Universal Credit standard allowance.</p><p> </p><p>Where requested deductions exceed the 40 per cent maximum, or there is insufficient Universal Credit in payment for all deductions to be made, a priority order is applied, which determines the order in which items should be deducted. ‘Last resort’ deductions, such as rent or fuel costs, are at the top of the priority order, ensuring that claimant welfare is prioritised, followed by social obligation deductions, such as fines and child maintenance, and finally benefit debt, such as Social Fund loans and benefit overpayments.</p><p> </p><p>There are two exceptions to the overall maximum deduction rate. The first is deductions for current consumption of gas, electricity and water, which do not count towards the overall maximum amount. The second is where a Conditionality Sanction or Fraud Penalty is being applied or an Advance is being recovered, ‘last resort deductions’ (that is arrears of rent, service charges, gas or electricity) continue to be taken, even if it means that more than 40 per cent is deducted. This is to protect vulnerable claimants from being made homeless or having their fuel disconnected.</p><p> </p><p>The Universal Credit, Personal Independence Payment, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance (Claims and Payments) Regulations 2013(S.I, 2013/380) and specifically Regulation 60 and Schedule 6, paragraph 4 explains how claimants are protected from excessive deductions.

Following this the NHS Action on Sugar scheme was launched and has reduced sales from 15.6% in July 2017 to 7.4% in June 2018 (as a proportion of total beverage sales in participating trusts). All 220 trusts have committed to this scheme, and 23 have stopped selling sugar sweetened beverages altogether.</p><p> </p><p>A targeted incentive scheme from 2016/17 – 2018/19 aimed to improve the food available for sale on NHS premises, targeting price promotions and adverts for unhealthy food and drink, encouraging trusts to provide healthy options 24/7, and setting limits on the percentage of packaged food and confectionary meeting defined calorie limits. Engagement with providers suggests that the scheme had a notable impact in raising the profile of healthy food and drink and in supporting negotiation with industry partners to ensure hospitals can lead by example.
