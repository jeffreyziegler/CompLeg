Whilst many parents prefer to take their children with them abroad, in some of the 168 countries and territories where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has UK-based staff, we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. However, frequent moves by staff and families between the United Kingdom and overseas, and between Posts overseas, can be disruptive to the education of the children. Therefore, the FCO provides Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA). This enables staff who meet certain eligibility criteria to choose to provide an uninterrupted education for their children at a British boarding school in the United Kingdom while they continue to take up postings overseas at regular intervals during their career. CEA is a long-standing policy run under successive governments that provides clearly defined and limited financial support to staff to help maintain the continuity of their children's education.</p><p>The figures below are for the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Continuity of Education Figures</p></td><td><p>​</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Financial Year</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Total CEA Costs</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2018/19</p></td><td><p>£10,932,399.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017/18</p></td><td><p>£11,725.460.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016/17</p></td><td><p>£12,703,109.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015/16</p></td><td><p>£12,409,062.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014/15</p></td><td><p>£12,943,134.00</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>UK based staff who do not use CEA are still required to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the start of the school term beginning after the child's 5th birthday, continuing until they reach school leaving age.

For authorised payment scams, where the customer has authorised a bank transfer but the money has been paid to a fraudulent recipient, the PSR has brought together consumer representatives and banks to produce an industry code of conduct to address this issue.

The PSRs aim to make payments safer and more secure and protect consumers. As set out in these regulations, if a payment transaction (be that a bank transfer or debit card payment) is not properly authorised by the customer, the customer’s bank or payment service provider must refund the amount of the transaction to the payer. For authorised payment scams, where the customer has authorised a bank transfer but the money has been paid to a fraudulent recipient, the PSR has brought together consumer representatives and banks to produce an industry code of conduct to address this issue. Launched in May 2019, the code sets out agreed principles for greater protection of consumers and the circumstances in which they will be reimbursed, marking a significant step in delivering improved protections for customers.</p><p> </p><p>Regarding debit card charges, the UK implemented the EU’s Interchange Fee Regulation in 2015 which introduced a cap on one of the key fees applicable to card payments.
