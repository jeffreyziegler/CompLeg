However, the numbers of people opting-out have been much lower than expected and less than one in ten employees who have been automatically enrolled have chosen not to continue to save through automatic enrolment. People can also chose to cease saving at any time if they feel that this is right in their circumstances.</p><p>The Department has commissioned research to monitor the extent of opt-out and cessation as part of its biennial Employers’ Pension Provision survey.

This prompts individuals to regularly reconsider their saving arrangements and reminds employers of their on-going automatic enrolment duties to their staff. This process has already started amongst the largest employers and The Pensions Regulator publishes monthly updates on the numbers of employees being re-enrolled in its Declaration of Compliance Monthly Report.
