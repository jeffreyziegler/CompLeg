While Government has no involvement in these local decisions, we expect councils to be open and transparent about the decisions they make about the pay and rewards for staff, particularly senior staff. Under the Localism Act 2011, councils are required to prepare and publish an annual pay policy statement setting out their approach to pay matters, particularly senior pay. In our pay accountability guidance to accompany measures in the Localism Act, councils are asked to give full council the opportunity to vote on severance packages of £100,000 or more before they are rubber-stamped. It is unacceptable for information about compensation payments to be withheld from local taxpayers and we welcome the CLG Select Committee’s recent comments that councils should publish the rationale for, and amount of, any financial payment to a departing chief officer within a month of the decision so that the public can understand why such a payment has been made. Severance payments made to senior staff must already be disclosed in an authority’s annual Statement of Accounts and cannot be protected from disclosure by confidentiality agreements.<br><br>On 3 October, the Department further strengthened the public's ability to scrutinise councils by ensuring that they get the data they deserve through the local government transparency code.

Neither the review nor the inspection makes specific judgements about the sexual exploitation of children or the effectiveness of the local child sexual exploitation action plans. However, inspectors are required to include in the cases they evaluate “children at risk of harm from physical, emotional and sexual abuse and neglect; inspectors will also want to identify those children and young people where the local authority have concerns that they may be vulnerable to child sexual exploitation and those children and young people who have been missing from care, home and education”. In undertaking the LSCB review inspectors are required to “evaluate the quality and impact of the policies and procedures produced by the LSCB, such as the local thresholds document and the child sexual exploitation action plan.” An LSCB’s response to child sexual exploitation is considered as part of the overall judgement on the performance of the LSCB.

The FFS is primarily paid for mandated activities that deliver the sentence of the court and licence conditions. PbR is paid for the achievement of reductions in reoffending against the baseline historical level and is designed to incentivise bidders to continuously innovate and improve performance throughout the life of the contract.</p><p> </p><p>PbR measurement will be based on a series of offender “cohorts”. These are the groups of offenders whose reoffending will determine the providers’ success or otherwise at reducing reoffending rates. Cohorts will be built up on a quarterly and annual basis and will include offenders released from a custodial sentence and offenders who begin a community order (CO) or a suspended sentence order (SSO). Cohorts will exclude offenders not subject to any of the above disposals, and offenders allocated to the National Probation Service. They will also exclude offenders on a CO or SSO which includes only a single electronically monitored requirement (as CRCs will not be responsible for supervising this group) and offenders who are subject only to an unpaid work requirement (as for this group, the court will not have imposed an additional rehabilitative intervention).</p><p> </p><p>CRCs will be paid for reducing reoffending rates significantly beyond historic levels. Those historic baselines are modelled to exclude the same types of offender that are excluded in the CRCs’ cohorts, thereby allowing a like-for-like comparison.</p><p> </p><p>We have consulted widely on the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms and received and responded to a balance of views.
