The Armed Forces offer some of the best training and education to people anywhere in society. Those opportunities begin at 16 with around 1,300 Junior Soldiers graduating from Harrogate each year. The Army Foundation College at Harrogate is the only JE Phase 1 training establishment in the British Army and the JE is a tried and trusted means of engaging young people leading them to a successful Army career. The college aims to create a well-rounded junior soldier, physically, conceptually and morally. The delivery of training is conducted in accordance with a carefully synchronised college programme and is aimed to be progressive and provide variety with a balance between classroom, camp and field training.</p><p>This review considered how the Army can continue to attract the best young people under the age of 18 and, in doing so, maximise the talent of the individual to the mutual benefit of the individual, the Army and society improving their social mobility. The tendency for under-18 recruits to serve for longer than their over-18 peers and the relatively high proportion of junior entrants that promote to senior NCO ranks over the course of their careers benefits the Army and the individual.</p><p>The Review found that while the JE scheme is performing well and remains attractive to potential recruits, it is not well known and could be advertised more effectively.

Our target is to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste throughout the life of the 25 Year Environment Plan, but for the most problematic plastics we are going faster - that is why we commit to work towards all plastic packaging placed on the UK market being recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.</p><p>We have made good progress, the Government’s plastic bag charge has led to a 90% reduction in the use of plastic carrier bags in the main retailers and raised in last year alone over £51 million for environmental causes. The Government also recently consulted on plans to extend the charge to all retailers and on increasing the minimum charge to at least 10p.</p><p> </p><p>We have recently consulted on a suite of measures to help overhaul the waste system. Collectively our proposals are aimed at boosting recycled content in plastic packaging, through a proposed tax on plastic packaging which does not meet a minimum threshold of at least 30% recycled content. This will make producers foot the bill for handling the packaging they place on the market when it becomes waste, and ending the confusion over household recycling by introducing more consistency in collection services. In addition, earlier this year the Government announced that a ban on the supply of plastic straws, stirrers, and plastic-stemmed cotton buds to the end user will come into force from April 2020.</p><p> </p><p>Industry is also taking action, in April last year, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation launched their world-leading UK Plastics Pact, with support from the Government, accounting for over 85% of plastic packaging used in UK supermarkets.

On Wednesday 2 October, the Prime Minister then set out his plan that “in the next ten years we will build 40 new hospitals in the biggest investment in hospital infrastructure for a generation.” As a step towards this, we have committed funding for six new hospitals as well as seed funding to support the initial stage of a further 34 building projects.</p><p>The package of funding includes:</p><p>- £2.7 billion for six new hospital projects to be delivered in our first phase of major hospital rebuilds (HIP1);</p><p>- £100 million to support for 21 major projects (£5 million each) comprising 34 hospital sites go to the next stage of developing their plans to be delivered in the second phase of major hospital rebuilds, subject to business case development and future spending reviews.

We also recognise that there may some more schemes suitable for investments that are not currently part of HIP1 and HIP2. These should continue developing their plans and priorities for local NHS infrastructure, and where exceptionally strong schemes come to light before HIP3, we will consider these in the context of available funding.</p>",,"Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford",,"2019-10-08T16:45:16.28Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148085/answer","Biography information for Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148085/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148085/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-10-02","Hospitals: Construction","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what is the estimated total cost of the 40 hospital building projects announced on 29 September.","false","Biography information for Lord Roberts of Llandudno",,"Lord Roberts of Llandudno","HL18013"
