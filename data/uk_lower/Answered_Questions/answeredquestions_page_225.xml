Decisions on the level of service provision are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local healthcare needs and priorities. However, NHS England and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), together with professional and stakeholder groups, are working together to see how IVF commissioning could be improved. One element of this is the ongoing work to develop a benchmark price that the NHS pays for infertility treatments. Commissioning guidance, which aims to improve the quality of commissioning and further encourage the implementation of the NICE fertility guideline, is being produced and will be disseminated by NHS England to all CCGs in England.</p><p> </p><p>The Department will continue to support the programme of work being taken forward by NHS England, HFEA and stakeholders.</p>","Ludlow","Mr Philip Dunne","106061","2017-10-12T12:34:30.747Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/765586/answer","Biography information for Mr Philip Dunne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/765586/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/765586/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-10-06","In Vitro Fertilisation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what plans his Department has to ensure that patients in England have equal access to comprehensive NHS IVF services.","false","Biography information for Steve McCabe","Birmingham, Selly Oak","Steve McCabe","106062"

For some women there may be no other treatment option. Because of ongoing concerns about women’s awareness of the risks, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has worked with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and patient groups to develop a set of materials to aid communication between health professionals and women and girls.</p><p>The valproate toolkit comprises booklets for healthcare professionals, a reminder card and a guide for women, a checklist for prescribers and clear package labelling carrying a prominent warning about use in pregnancy. The MHRA continues to work with stakeholders to disseminate information and ensure compliance with the statutory advice. On 6 April 2017, NHS Improvement and MHRA sent a Patient Safety Alert through the NHS Central Alerting System to further highlight risks to the unborn child and support the safety of girls and women taking valproate. The alert directs organisations to undertake systematic identification of women and girls taking valproate and to use the MHRA resources to support them to make informed choices. Consistent action was taken in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p><p>The impact of the measures taken is being monitored and studies show a steady decline in prescribing to women in childbearing potential. The adequacy of measures taken to date across Europe is being reviewed in a Europe-wide review that started in March 2017. There are ongoing discussions at official level as the review progresses. An expert working group of the Commission on Human Medicines has been convened to inform the United Kingdom position during the ongoing European Union review and consider other measures which may be required across the healthcare system to ensure compliance with the regulatory position in clinical practice.</p><p>France has its own legislation that allows for a state funded compensation scheme for medical accidents and they have amended this to include claims from those affected by valproate. We understand that this has been operational from June 2017. We are monitoring developments in France and do not feel that commissioning research is necessary at this time. We are not aware of similar action in other member states. There is currently no proposal to establish a care compensation plan specifically for those affected by valproate in the UK. However, the Government has great sympathy for those families who have been affected by the use of valproate in pregnancy. There is support available for families with children born with a disability.

Closing dates for bids is 3 November.</p></li><li><p>Consulted on changing planning policy to support more Build to Rent homes, including affordable rental homes, as well as providing a £65 million boost to the biggest development of homes built specifically for private rent in the UK.

The consultation closed on 2 June.

However, it is predicted that within 20 years, 90% of all jobs will require some element of digital skills. Effective digital skills provision is essential to ensure the workforce is prepared for this and future technological changes.</p><p> </p><p>Government is taking action at all stages of the education and training pipeline to help encourage young people into digital-related careers and meet demand for digital skills in and out of London. We have introduced computing as a statutory national curriculum subject at all four key stages, and have introduced a new Computer Science GCSE and A Level. We have also introduced an entitlement for adults who lack basic digital skills to undertake fully-funded training as part of the publicly-funded adult education offer. This will ensure adults have the opportunity to secure the basic digital skills that are increasingly needed to participate effectively in the labour market and day–to-day life.</p><p> </p><p>We have also established the Digital Skills Partnership, which was announced in the Digital Strategy (March 2017) and launched in July 2017.
