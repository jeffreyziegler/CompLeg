It is important to understand however significant caveats about the interpretation of these figures for transport spending.</p><p> </p><p>In terms of the regional allocation of spending, the CRA attempts to allocate expenditure on the basis of which region benefits from the spend rather than where it is made. However, it is not always possible to put the value of spending down to certain parts of the country, and this is particularly a problem for spending on motorway and trunk roads and on the railway due to the nature of these transport networks. For example whilst spending on a local hospital is likely to predominantly benefit those who live in that area, and so it is fairly clear which region benefits from the spend, spending on a motorway or railway line in one area will benefit not just those living nearby but also those travelling from many areas across the country. Whilst the Department does try to distribute rail funding across the regions based on which passengers benefit, allocations are inevitably fairly imprecise.</p><p> </p><p>In terms of the calculation of this regional spending on a per capita (i.e. per resident population) basis, the calculation for London does not account for the fact that London has a substantial number of daily commuters and visitors, both domestically and internationally, who will be using and benefitting from the public transport networks and roads in London but who are not residents in London. In particular, as the main international gateway into the country London will also have transport investments which look beyond just the local resident population.</p><p> </p><p>The unique scale and urban density of London by comparison to other parts of the country also means that it is particularly suited to large scale public transport networks.</p><p> </p><p>Taking the above into account, Government expenditure on transport for 2015-16 is shown in the table below.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Table 1.

Capital formation is expenditure, net of sales, on fixed assets (such as buildings, vehicles and machinery) and net stock building, and can be measured gross or net of depreciation. Fixed assets are assets that can be used repeatedly to produce goods and services and generally last more than one year.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Current expenditure</strong> is spending on items that are consumed in the process of providing public services or, in other words, is recurring spending.

The single Services have appropriate measures in place for dealing with juveniles within the Service justice system (SJS) which mirror the CJS. For example, the requirement for the provision of an appropriate adult for a juvenile is detailed within the Service Police Codes of Practice in a manner identical to the civilian police PACE Codes of Practice. In addition, the military chain of command always provides an assisting officer to any Service person facing disciplinary action, irrespective of age. All criminal records are uploaded on to the police national computer and maintained in accordance with the Home Office rules and procedures set for that system.</p><p> </p><p>The SJS uses the law of England and Wales for criminal offences, via the Armed Forces Act 2006. In doing so, the Service judiciary utilise the sentencing guidelines set within the CJS. The SJS has a range of sentencing options available, which can include a period of detention. Detention is only used when it is deemed necessary, proportionate and a lawful outcome within the sentencing guidelines. Whilst there are additional Service offences within the Armed Forces Act 2006 bespoke to the SJS, none of these carry a life sentence.</p><p> </p><p>When held at the Military Training and Corrective Centre (MCTC), detainees aged 16 years are always accommodated separately from adults.

The best way to protect access to justice is with a properly funded courts and tribunals service.</p><p> </p><p>Fees are necessary to support an effective courts and tribunals system that supports victims and vulnerable people, and is easy for ordinary people to use. In 2015/16, the Government spent around £1.9 billion on our courts and tribunals and recovered only around £700m through fees and other income. We do not believe that the taxpayer should continue to meet all of this cost.</p><p> </p><p>We are getting rid of flat fees and replacing them with a fair, banded, structure related to the value of the estate. This includes raising the fee threshold from £5,000 to £50,000 and lifting an extra 25,000 estates out of fees altogether.</p><p> </p><p>More than half of estates in England and Wales will pay no probate fee and over 90 per cent of estates will pay £1,000 or less. The fees will be implemented on a banded structure, increasing in line with estate values, meaning higher fees are paid by those who can afford to do so. No one will pay more than 1 per cent of the total estate value.</p><p> </p><p>Using the authoritative ONS projections, we have recently improved our estimates of the number of estates in England and Wales.</p><p> </p><p>With this more accurate data, we have produced a refreshed distribution of the estate values table. We have also updated our estimates to take account of HMRC’s most recent data on the distribution of estate values. <em> </em>These minor adjustments to Table 1 (page 11) of the consultation response do not alter the substance of, or rationale for, the proposals on which we consulted, or the Government’s decision to proceed with the changes.
