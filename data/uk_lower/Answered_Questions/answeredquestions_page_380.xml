These sites can be designated for either biological or geological interest.</li><li>Ramsar sites, which are wetlands of international importance, designated under the Ramsar Convention. This includes marine areas with a water depth at low tide of less than six metres. Ramsar sites are generally also underpinned by designation as SSSIs.</li></ul><p>Together, these sites contribute to the Blue Belt, a network of sites around the coasts of the UK, which forms our contribution to an ecologically coherent network of MPAs in the North East Atlantic.</p><p>We have already made good progress in designating a network of sites in the Blue Belt. Over 16% of UK waters and almost a quarter of English inshore waters are now within MPAs.</p><p>Based on current evidence the SAC network contribution for habitats can be considered complete. UK governments are considering advice on SACs for harbour porpoise, although no decision with regard to consultation has yet been taken.</p><p>Defra and the devolved administrations in the UK plan to complete the identification of SPAs for birds in the UK marine area during 2016.</p><p>Defra is seeking to fill the remaining gaps in the Blue Belt through two more tranches of MCZs.
