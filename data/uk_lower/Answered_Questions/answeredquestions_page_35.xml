In Sub-Saharan Africa, we are:</p><ul><li><p>Using funding from the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) which has led, for example, to the roll out of new peacekeeping-intelligence architecture in the three missions with the highest number of casualties - <strong>Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic</strong>. Our sizeable funding contribution to the UN is used as leverage to advocate for UN reform and improve the way it operates.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Promoting peace and security in <strong>Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali</strong> through diplomacy and targeted support. We support UN and French security efforts through direct contributions to MINUSMA in Northern Mali and the deployment of three RAF Chinook helicopters to France’s Counter-Terrorism Operation Barkhane. We work closely with the G5 and other partners to provide life-saving assistance and protection to people on the frontline of conflict. The UK is also focusing on developing programmes to tackle the long-term drivers of instability and poverty.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Urging all parties in <strong>Benin</strong> to engage in dialogue to overcome their differences and find a peaceful solution. We share the concerns of the EU, France, the US and the UN about acts of violence in Benin following the 28 April legislative elections.</p></li><li><p>Regularly addressing the situation in the North-West and South-West (Anglophone) regions of <strong>Cameroon</strong> with international partners including the UN, EU, Commonwealth and African Union to encourage and support efforts to resolve the crisis. The UK remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation in the Anglophone regions and the impact it is having on the lives of ordinary civilians. We have shared experiences with the Government of Cameroon (GoC) on conflict resolution; and remain ready to provide further support. We raised our concerns during briefings at the UN Security Council on 4 and 12 June, and led on a statement with Austria at the UN Human Rights Council in March, which was supported by 39 countries, calling on the GoC to establish a credible political dialogue to address root causes of the conflict.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Providing the <strong>Central African Republic (CAR)</strong> with significant humanitarian spend (£63m since 2013) and core contributions to key multilateral organisations on the ground, such as the World Bank and the EU. Support to UN peacekeeping efforts include assessed contributions (£40.5m per annum to MINUSCA peacekeeping mission and €2m to the EU Training Mission).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Pressing our long-term approach to stability in the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),</strong> including through significant contributions to the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO). We are supporting security reforms, stabilisation and peace building initiatives through DFID programmes and the CSSF.</p></li><li><p>Providing training to <strong>Nigeria’s</strong> armed forces combat insurgent groups, support communities to better respond and manage the effects of violent conflict, and to support the reintegration of former members of Boko Haram. We are also working closely with the EU, US and UN to provide technical support to the Nigerian Government to address the underlying causes of intercommunal violence affecting many parts of Nigeria, including the recently announced National Livestock Transformation Plan, which aims to mitigate escalating violence between pastoralists and farmers. We are currently reviewing how we might further assist the Nigerian Government in their efforts to tackle conflict in the northeast of the country.</p></li><li><p>Building on the work of the UK-hosted London Conference on <strong>Somalia</strong> in 2017, which brought together Somalia’s key partners, including the UN, EU and a number of members of the Commonwealth. This established a set of agreements that provide the foundation for a more coherent international approach to Somalia with conflict resolution at its core. We are careful to ensure that all UK policies and programmes in Somalia maintain a focus on conflict sensitivity, and regularly undertake conflict analysis to support this. In particular, our work includes activity under the CSSF to address the drivers of conflict and build capacity at both local and regional levels.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Supporting community-based peacebuilding programmes, in concert with the UN and other international partners, namely the African Union, in areas of instability and conflict in <strong>Sudan</strong>. The UK has a long standing role in supporting sustainable peace in Sudan. As a member of the Troika and bilaterally, we have supported progress in the Peace Process seeking to find a solution to the conflicts in Darfur and the Two Areas. In addition the UK plays a leading role in the UN Security Council, particularly as the penholder on the mandate for UNAMID – the African Union hybrid Mission in Darfur.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Minister for Africa met with <strong>Togolese</strong> President Gnassingbé and reiterated the importance of delivering 2020 Presidential elections on time and a return to inclusive politics. The UK continues to encourage all parties to avoid violence and respect the human rights of all Togolese people. The UK supports the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) brokered roadmap, along with the EU, which has seen Togo recently adopt two-term limits on presidential terms, in line with other ECOWAS states.

We strongly support current US efforts to drive forward peace. The UK welcomed the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in April that set out a clear path for how the EU will support peace in Afghanistan. We also support the important contribution made by the UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA). Prospects for peace are probably better now than at any time since 2001.

The Home Office and Egyptian Ministry of Interior are committed to increasing cooperation across a wide range of areas, including counter-terrorism, illegal migration and organised crime.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran:</strong> We are working with regional and international partners to call for restraint in order to de-escalate the situation. Yet we remain determined to preserve the Iran nuclear deal, and are working with E3 partners to achieve this. This deal remains in our shared interests as long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal in full. It is a key achievement of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture, which is in our shared security interests. We are deeply concerned at the heightened level of regional tension. Our priority remains de-escalation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iraq:</strong> Providing support, together with the Coalition and international partners, to the Iraqi security sector in countering the ongoing threat from Daesh, and addressing the root causes of this threat. This involves addressing the underlying political, social and economic drivers which led to Daesh’s rise. We continue to support, alongside UN partners, the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) whose mandate renewal was unanimously approved on 21 May 2019. The UK held the pen on UNSCR 2379 which was unanimously adopted by the UNSC in 2017 and established the UN Investigative Team for the Accountability of Daesh (UNITAD). UNITAD will seek to ensure documentation and accountability for Daesh crimes and work with the Government of Iraq to support reconciliation efforts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Libya:</strong> We are engaging in intensive diplomacy, involving the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ghassan Salamé, and partners in the UN and EU. The UK is clear that all parties must commit to a ceasefire, ensure humanitarian access, and return to UN-mediated political talks. The EU28 issued a statement on 12 April 2019 condemning the violence, and urging all parties to resume political dialogue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syria:</strong> Our diplomatic and programme efforts remain focused on bringing the conflict to an end through a UN-led negotiated political settlement. The UN-led Geneva process between the Syrian parties remains the forum to achieve this. We are also engaged in completing the enduring defeat of Daesh.

As outlined in our Digital Strategy and Charter, our ambition is to ensure the UK is the best place in the world to start and grow a digital business - and that ambition remains after we leave the EU. Tech Nation and Dealroom have released figures showing that investment in UK tech reached £6.8 billion ($8.7bn) last year and has already reached £3.8 billion ($4.8bn) in the first half of 2019, showing that the UK tech ecosystem is still world-leading and remains in a strong position.</p><p>Through our extensive engagement with the sector, we understand that the primary barriers to growth for startups are having adequate access to both finance and talent. That is why for finance, Government announced a new £2.5 billion British Patient Capital programme, which is expected to attract a further £5 billion in private investment, in order to support UK companies with high growth potential to access the long-term investment they need to grow and go global.</p><p>To continue to attract international talent, we have doubled the number of Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visas to 2,000, and taken doctors and nurses out of the Tier 2 visa cap, freeing up many more skilled worker visas to other sectors, including tech. At the end of March this year, Home Office launched the new Start-Up and Innovator visa routes for entrepreneurs, which will replace a route exclusively for graduates, opening it up to other talented business founders.</p><p>In the Autumn Budget 2017 we also announced investment of £21 million to expand Tech City UK into a nationwide network – Tech Nation – aimed at accelerating the growth of the digital tech sector across the country. The funding will help Tech Nation support 40,000 entrepreneurs and up to 4,000 start-ups as they scale their businesses across the UK including Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, and Newcastle.

That is why we have committed to ending rough sleeping for good, with the aim of halving it by 2022.</p><p>Last summer we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy. This sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now, but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all. The Government has now committed over £1.2 billion to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over the spending review period.</p><p>We are giving serious consideration to the findings of the report from St Mungo’s and Homeless Link. Housing-related support services are a local government responsibility. To deepen our understanding, we are undertaking a review of housing-related support services in order to build a comprehensive picture of current arrangements and how support and housing fit together.</p><p>We also know that we need to build more social homes, which will help us to achieve our goal of preventing homelessness. The Government has made £9 billion available through the Affordable Homes Programme to March 2022, to deliver 250,000 new affordable homes of a wide range of tenures - including social rent. The expanded programme will provide homes to meet the housing needs of a range of people in different circumstances and different housing markets – building the right homes in the right places.</p><p>We understand the importance of giving local areas security around funding. The Chancellor has said that there will be a spending review this year. Decisions about the future of homelessness funding, along with all other government funding, will be made at this point. Ministers have made clear that homelessness and rough sleeping are a key priority for this Government. We are working with other government departments to assess what more can be done to combat rough sleeping and wider homelessness. This work is being overseen by the Ministerial Rough Sleeping and Homelessness Reduction Taskforce and will be an important part of our preparations for the forthcoming Spending Review.</p><p>While there is more work to be done in this area, there are some positive developments which I would like to point to. For the first time since 2010, the annual rough sleeping statistics saw a decrease in the number of those sleeping rough. Whilst only 2 per cent, this is in the face of average yearly increases of nearly 16 per cent. The annual rough sleeping statistics also showed a 19 per cent decrease in the number of those sleeping rough amongst the 83 local authorities that were part of the first phase of our Rough Sleeping Initiative (RSI) in comparison with 2017. We are currently carrying out an evaluation of the impact of our RSI, that will help to determine what effect our funding has had on reducing numbers of rough sleepers</p><p><br>In its first year, RSI funding provided over 1,750 new bed spaces and 500 staff across the country. This year we have expanded the initiative with an investment of £46 million providing funding for an estimated 2,600 bed spaces and 750 staff. £12 million of this is for areas new to the programme, bringing the total authorities funded to 246.</p>","South Derbyshire","Mrs Heather Wheeler","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130867/answer",,,,,,"2019-06-17T16:10:55.963Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130867/answer","Biography information for Mrs Heather Wheeler","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130867/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2019-06-10","Homelessness","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, what assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of recent research by St Mungo’s and Homeless Link showing reductions in local authority funding and in spending on homelessness between 2008-09 and 2017-18 and and an increase in rough sleeping since 2010.","false","Biography information for Catherine West","Hornsey and Wood Green","Catherine West","262413"

Working with young people the Jobcentre can assess the particular need of the young person and then refer them to the most appropriate place. For example, sector-based work academies last for up to 6 weeks and have elements of work experience, short training and a guaranteed interview for a real apprenticeship or other job. Those further from the labour market may benefit from a traineeship which can last for up to 6 months and includes a focus on helping the young person reach level 2 in English and Maths.</p><p> </p><p>The department continues to gain learning from previous programmes and evaluations to ensure it designs tailored provision, such as the new Work and Health Programme, that has minimum support levels for all customers and deliver improved outcomes to the customer and the department.</p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130873/answer",,,,,,"2019-06-13T15:25:14.937Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130873/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130873/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2019-06-10","Employment Schemes: Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, with reference to sections five and six of the evaluation of the Young and Successful programme, published by Groundwork Greater Nottingham in 2018, if she will take steps to ensure that young people furthest from the labour market are not adversely affected by payment by results requirements of employability programmes.","false","Biography information for Cat Smith","Lancaster and Fleetwood","Cat Smith","262407"

This is because they do not compare groups with the same characteristics; typically, the legacy benefit group have been on benefits for some time, where the arrears may be under long-term management. The Universal Credit group, on the other hand, are often new to benefits, and are likely to have experienced a change in their circumstances – for example, a debt-creating event like losing a job or separation.

We are currently extending this analysis to include a number of other housing providers. It will be published when completed.

In 2017/18, UKRI’s direct funding was supporting around 22,000 studentships, about 22% of the UK total. In addition, Research England’s QR Research Degree Programme (RDP) supervision fund provides more than £250 million of annual funding contributing to the costs that universities face in supervising research degree programmes.</p><p> </p><p>In many cases, this investment is also made in partnership, leveraging further support from higher education institutions and industry to maximise the impact from the public investment. For example, in 2019, UKRI invested £100m in 16 new Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in Artificial Intelligence, based at 14 UK universities with 300 partners. Project partners are investing £78 million in cash or in-kind contributions and partner universities are committing a further £23 million, resulting in an overall investment of more than £200 million.</p><p> </p><p>Given the large commitments partner universities make to these investments, we are mindful of the need to maintain sustainability.

Our ban on microbeads in cosmetic and personal care products, one of the strongest in the world, came into force in June 2018. Our plastic bag charge has led to an 86% reduction in the use of plastic carrier bags and last year alone raised over £51 million for environmental causes. We have consulted on plans to extend the charge to all retailers and on increasing the minimum 5p charge to at least 10p, and last month announced that a ban on the distribution and/or sale of plastic straws, stirrers, and plastic stemmed cotton buds will come into force from April 2020. A full response to this consultation can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gove-takes-action-to-ban-plastic-straws-stirrers-and-cotton-buds" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gove-takes-action-to-ban-plastic-straws-stirrers-and-cotton-buds</a>.</p><p>These policies are helping to deliver the Resources and Waste Strategy for England, our framework for eliminating all avoidable plastic waste. It builds on commitments in our 25 Year Environment Plan and sets out plans to maximise the value we get from resources, minimise waste, promote a circular economy and protect the environment better.</p><p>Earlier this year we published consultations on a number of key policy measures to significantly change the way that we manage our waste, and in doing so, prevent plastic waste from entering the oceans in the first place: reforming existing packaging waste regulations, exploring the introduction of a deposit return scheme for drinks containers, and increasing consistency in the recycling system, along with a parallel consultation on the plastic packaging tax that the Chancellor announced in the Budget last year. We will publish the Government’s responses to these consultations on GOV.UK in due course.</p><p>Although 80% of plastic waste comes from land, 20% comes from ocean sources. Abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) accounts for 10% of all plastic waste in the ocean and presents acute threats to marine life. Through the forthcoming International Ocean Strategy the UK is committed to spearheading international collaboration to establish a detailed understanding of the ocean, with the aim of significantly reducing the contribution of ALDFG to the problem of marine litter. The UK also signed up to the Global Ghost Gear Initiative in 2016, a pioneering scheme tackling lost and abandoned fishing gear on a global scale. Through this initiative we are committed to working with our partners to address the management of existing ALDFG and the mitigation of potential ALDFG.</p><p> </p><p>The Government recognises the benefits and importance of youth outreach and education programmes in tackling this issue. In 2018 a new partnership between the UK Scouts and the Government was set up to help young people better understand the importance of reducing plastic consumption and marine litter. The UK is also working in partnership with UN Environment, collaborating internationally with young people across the Commonwealth to support them in becoming leaders and advocates for behaviour change.</p><p>We are committed to our international work to lead action on the global threat of marine litter.

The interim NHS People Plan will be developed over the summer with publication of the final version expected after the spending review later this year.</p><p>The Government also made a manifesto commitment to “…strengthen the entitlement for NHS employees to flexible working to help those with caring responsibilities for young children or older relatives.” This includes the improvement in the use of technology to help trusts with e-rostering and e-job planning to optimise the use of their permanent and temporary workforces.</p><p>The Junior Doctor’s contract agreement provides for £1,000 less than full time trainee allowance to recognise additional costs such trainees face.</p><p>NHS Improvement continues to promote flexible working for staff including doctors and nurses through its NHS Staff Retention Collaborative. This initiative initially focussed on nurses and clinicians working in mental health but has now been extended to all staff groups<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Flexible working for all staff including doctors and nurses is promoted through the NHS Constitution which states that staff have the right “to fair treatment regarding leave, rights and flexible working” and also states that “employers…must consider flexible working requests by employees with at least 26 weeks continuous service”.<sup>2</sup></p><p>The Department is currently working closely with NHS Improvement to roll out smarter staff banks. As well as reducing reliance on expensive recruitment agencies, staff banks provide a further opportunity for flexible working in the NHS. Effective staff banks can give staff the freedom to manage their own time, using simple, user-friendly technologies to pick up shifts when they want them, get paid quickly, and have control over their pension contributions. Furthermore, where several banks are joined together into collaborative banks, trusts can dramatically increase the size of the flexible workforce they can reach and increase the opportunities for those working flexibly to choose the shifts that fit in with their lives.</p><p>Notes:</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/improving-staff-retention/" target="_blank">https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/improving-staff-retention/</a></p><p><sup>2 </sup><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770675/The_Handbook_to_the_NHS_Constitution_-_2019.pdf" target="_blank">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770675/The_Handbook_to_the_NHS_Constitution_-_2019.pdf</a></p>","Wimbledon","Stephen Hammond","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130694/answer",,,,,,"2019-06-12T16:12:00.247Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130694/answer","Biography information for Stephen Hammond","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130694/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-06-07","Health Professions: Flexible Working","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps his Department is taking to help promote flexible working for (a) doctors and (b) nurses in the NHS.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","261468"

Overall, prosecutions and convictions for domestic abuse are both up since 2010 – by 20 per cent and 28 per cent respectively, with 76% of all prosecutions resulting in successful convictions, the highest proportion since 2010. However, the CPS are working closely with the police locally and nationally to ensure appropriate referrals are made by the police and to address any fall in referrals where needed. In November last year, MHCLG awarded £22 million for domestic abuse projects across the country. This is helping to provide over 2,200 new beds in refuges and other safe accommodation, as well as access to education and tailored employment and life skills guidance. MHCLG are also consulting on potential measure for sustainable delivery of support for victims and their children in accommodation-based services for domestic abuse across England.

The number of consultations between CPS prosecutors and police investigators is important. Consultations allow for a close examination of the evidence thus ensuring the case is strong. Clearly, the more consultations that take place, the longer the time between receipt of the case and the decision to charge.</p><p> </p><p>Police are now encouraged to seek early investigative advice more often and in particular in rape and serious sexual offences cases. Early investigative advice helps to ensure that cases are thoroughly investigated and the evidence to be brought before the court is strong. As a result, fewer cases are dropped after the defendant has been charged. With the increase in early investigative advice, CPS is more often involved at an earlier stage in proceedings and this will invariably impact on the average number of consultations and overall timeliness.</p><p> </p><p>There has also been an increase in the complexity of rape cases investigated by the police. Investigations often involve large amounts of electronic material (social media, emails, text messages, video and photographs) which needs to be reviewed by prosecutors before a charging decision can be made. This also impacts on the average number of consultations and timeliness of the pre-charge stage of the case.</p><p> </p><p>CPS prosecutors work closely with police colleagues to build strong cases which can be brought before the courts. Increased complexity has been evidenced over time by the rise in the average number of consultations with the police. Since 2010/11, the number has increased from 1.71 to 1.98 consultations per case, a rise of 16%.</p><p> </p><p>Changes have now been made to the Casework Management System to provide for a more sophisticated level of reporting. In future, CPS will be able to report the timeliness for each individual consultation.</p>","South East Cambridgeshire","Lucy Frazer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130704/answer",,,,,,"2019-06-13T08:28:06.887Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130704/answer","Biography information for Lucy Frazer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1130704/answer",,,,,"88","Attorney General","Attorney General","2019-06-07","Rape: Prosecutions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Attorney General, what the average number of days taken from a report of rape to a decision to charge was in each year since 2010.","false","Biography information for Gloria De Piero","Ashfield","Gloria De Piero","261501"

This includes a range of settings such as semi-independent units, supported accommodation, hostels, foyers and supported lodgings. These settings provide accommodation with either on-site or floating support. ‘Other accommodation’ settings can provide a useful stepping-stone for young people who are increasingly able to make decisions for themselves but are not fully ready for the challenges of maintaining an independent tenancy. As these settings provide support, rather than care, Ofsted does not regulate them.</p><p> </p><p>Where a local authority places a young person in unregulated provision, it must ensure that the accommodation is ‘suitable’.

The March 2019 assessment of the terms of the 2018-19 Memorandum of Understanding found that the PA continues to demonstrate a credible commitment to DFID’s ‘partnership principles’, including the principles of non-violence, under increasingly volatile conditions. As in other parts of the world where DFID works, this does not mean that we agree on all of the government or authority’s policies or actions – but rather that there is a credible foundation on which to work to tackle poverty and work towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
