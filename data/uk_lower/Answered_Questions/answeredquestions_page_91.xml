In response to the spread of ASF in Eastern Europe and the confirmation of disease in feral pigs in Belgium, Defra’s risk assessment level has been raised to medium. This has been extensively and robustly communicated to the industry, all pig keepers and agencies working to protect our biosecurity. Correspondingly we have further increased our disease prevention activities. Defra is continuously closely monitoring the ongoing global disease situation.</p><p> </p><p>EU safeguard measures stops the movement of pigs and potentially risky pig products out of ASF affected areas in Member States. Defra checks the EU data systems to verify this for consignments coming to the UK. We have taken a strong risk based approach to any product we consider may be an issue. Defra is working very closely with the Commission and other MSs, included those affected, to share ASF expertise and knowledge.</p><p> </p><p>Practising strict biosecurity is essential for pig keepers to protect the health of their own animals. The risk of exposure to the pig population in the UK is highly dependent on the level of biosecurity on pig premises and is still considered to be low.</p><p> </p><p>To ensure awareness of the pathways and their risks which could potentially introduce ASF to the UK, all administrations have been running a communications campaign supported by the pig industry and veterinary bodies. This has been targeted with messages appropriate to pig keepers, smallholders, vets, slaughterhouses, hunters and transport operators using a variety of methods. Messaging to pig keepers include that it is essential to adhere to the swill feeding ban, and practise scrupulous biosecurity practices. Another key focus for awareness is people returning from ASF affected areas to remind them that it is essential to cleanse and disinfect vehicles and equipment, and of the risks posed by personal imports of meat from these areas.</p><p> </p><p>Defra has robust contingency plans in place to respond to outbreaks of exotic disease such as ASF and these plans are regularly tested.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016465","Home Office","false","2019-02-26","<p>The Serious Crime Act 2015 introduced a new domestic abuse offence of coercive or controlling behaviour in intimate and familial relationships. The statutory guidance underpinning the offence is clear that financial abuse, such as controlling the victim’s finances, is a type of behaviour that can form part of a purposeful pattern of behaviour over time to exert power, control or coercion over another person.</p><p>In 2017-18 960 offences of coercive or controlling behaviour have been charged and reached a first hearing, more than three times the volume in the previous year. This shows that the offence is having an impact and sends a strong message that coercive or controlling behaviour will not be tolerated.</p><p>On 21 January we published our landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill and consultation response which will transform the cross-Government response to this devastating crime. The draft Bill includes provisions for a statutory definition of domestic abuse, including economic abuse. Replacing ‘financial’ with ‘economic’ acknowledges how broad this form of abuse is and how many aspects of a victim’s life it can affect, such as limiting their access to fundamental resources such as money, food, transport, employment and housing. This will raise awareness of the issue of economic abuse and also enable frontline professionals and the criminal justice system to better understand, recognise and tackle it, so that victims can be supported to achieve the economic stability that they need.</p><p>The draft Bill is underpinned by a comprehensive package of non-legislative action which we have set out in our consultation response, including a commitment to review the effectiveness of the coercive or controlling behaviour offence to ensure it is fit for purpose and that it adequately protects victims from abuse. In addition, we have committed to update the statutory guidance and CPS legal guidance on the offence to include economic abuse and provide guidance on how this form of abuse can manifest itself as part of a pattern of coercive control</p><p> </p>","Louth and Horncastle","Victoria Atkins",,"2019-02-26T15:09:01.627Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016465/answer","Biography information for Victoria Atkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016465/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016465/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2018-12-03","Fraud: Prosecutions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the Serious Crime Act 2015 on prosecuting perpetrators of financial abuse.","false","Biography information for Graham P Jones","Hyndburn","Graham P Jones","196884"

Every child – including those from economically deprived backgrounds, with special educational needs, or who are in need of help and protection from children’s social care – should have the opportunity to achieve good outcomes. The government is working to ensure that local leaders are supported to provide these vulnerable children with the services they need to achieve well in education and, where necessary, to have a safe and stable home life.</p><p>To help school leaders support the most disadvantaged children, we have spent over £13 billion since 2011 – almost £2.4 billion this year alone – through the pupil premium to tackle educational inequality. In 2011 we established the Education Endowment Foundation with £137 million to research and promote the most effective ways of using pupil premium, so that schools leaders can improve their disadvantaged pupils’ outcomes.</p><p>In schools, our system leaders continue to provide support to help deliver better outcomes for vulnerable children. To ensure that system leaders can support all students, teaching schools must demonstrate high levels of progress and attainment for all pupils, and especially disadvantaged pupils, in order to be designated and funded by the department.</p><p>We know that many disadvantaged pupils have special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), and the government has also provided over £340 million since April 2014, to support local authorities, working with their partners, including health and schools, to implement the SEND reforms. We have funded training and a SEND leadership programme to support local authorities and health services to deliver their SEND services, which included training on joint commissioning.</p><p>Equally, where children need help and support from social care to achieve safety and stability in their lives, we know effective leadership is vital for good practice to thrive. ‘Putting Children First’ sets out our reform programme to improve the quality of leadership and of the workforce in children’s social care. As part of these reforms, we have established the Children’s Social Care What Works Centre, to develop the evidence base for leaders to use in delivering what works to support vulnerable children and families. We are building further evidence of what works to improve these children’s educational outcomes at a national and a local level through the Children in Need review.</p><p> </p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2018-12-11T16:24:04.717Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1019345/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1019345/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1019345/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-12-03","Children: Protection","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he is taking to support local leaders in delivering better outcomes for vulnerable children.","false","Biography information for Philip Davies","Shipley","Philip Davies","198189"
