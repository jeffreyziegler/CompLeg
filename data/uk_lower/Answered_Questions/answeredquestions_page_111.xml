The accounting policy used by the Whole of Government Accounts in recognising intangible assets is as follows (per page 82 of the 2016-17 accounts): “Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the government and if their cost can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently valued based on current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are revalued using indices or another suitable model.”</p>",,"Lord Bates","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/984268/answer",,,,,,"2018-10-23T10:55:54.513Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/984268/answer","Biography information for Lord Bates","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/984268/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2018-10-09","Government Departments: Databases","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government whether any Government controlled data sets are cited as capital assets on the Whole of Government Accounts; and if so, which ones.","false","Biography information for Lord Freyberg",,"Lord Freyberg","HL10476"

NHSBT needs to collect more than 6,000 blood donations every day to treat patients in need across England.</p><p> </p><p>NHSBT undertake a range of activities to drive recruitment of around 200,000 new donors each year to off-set donors who can longer donate for reasons such as illness, travel or pregnancy. In addition, NHSBT has undertaken work to change its donor base to better reflect the needs of NHS patients. In particular, it is working to recruit a significant number of new blood donors from a black African or black Caribbean background.</p><p> </p><p>Initiatives to support this goal have included work with black Christian churches across England, to encourage more black donors to register, book an appointment and give blood. NHSBT continues to work with black Asian and minority ethnic charity partners, including the Islamic Unity Society and Sewaday to promote registration drives and publicise sessions. It has also carried out Know Your Type events in high population Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic areas where individuals can learn their blood type with a finger prick test and be encouraged to book an appointment to donate.</p><p> </p><p>NHSBT has continued this promotion in 2018 with the B Positive choir, which was created by NHSBT. The members include blood donors and blood recipients, people who have blood-related medical conditions such as sickle cell disease, their families, friends and people who work with blood.</p><p> </p><p>NHSBT is currently implementing the ‘Taking Organ Transplantation to 2020: A UK Strategy’ which was launched in 2013. The strategy aims to achieve world class performance in organ donation and transplantation. It was developed by NHSBT and the four United Kingdom Health Departments. The strategy set the agenda for increasing organ donation and transplantation rates to world class standards over the next few years.</p><p> </p><p>There is an urgent shortage of organs for people from all backgrounds. The problem is particularly acute for black, Asian and minority ethnic patients. These patients are over-represented on the waiting list. They are more likely to need an organ transplant than the rest of the population as they are more susceptible to illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension, which could result in organ failure. NHSBT is running a number of projects and engaging with stakeholders to address this issue.</p><p> </p><p>During Organ Donation Week 2018 NHSBT and the Department announced a community investment scheme to break down myths and barriers and increase support for organ donation among black, Asian and ethnic minority communities. Community and faith-based groups from across England and Wales were invited to apply for funding for projects to promote organ donation. An estimated £115,000 has been made available for projects in England in the first year of the scheme.</p><p> </p><p>Despite these efforts, there are over 5,000 people on a transplant waiting list in England. To address this challenge, in October 2017, the Prime Minister announced plans to increase organ donation by shifting the balance of presumption in favour of organ donation.

In 2017 the SUY route was extended to include additional incentives to encourage more Warrant Officers to apply. This is now known as the SUY(Warrant Officer) scheme.</p><p> </p><p>The Royal Navy issues regular information on this subject to all its personnel to encourage consideration of this promotion route. In recent years the Navy has reviewed and extended the validity of the Admiralty Interview Board pass for UY and SUY candidates and adjusted age limitations placed on these routes to expand the candidate pool. In 2018 the RN made clear the process to be followed to apply for a Commission, and the ability for candidates to apply at the same time for multiple routes (UY, SUY or SUY(WO) if eligible) and for multiple branches subject to the requisite skills and qualifications. In addition, the Engineers issued separate guidance to clarify the routes for rating candidates to be extracted as Engineer Officers to maximise opportunities, and minimise training requirements based on their academic qualifications, such as those already degree qualified, or who have attained a Foundation Degree through technical career courses for ratings.</p><p> </p><p>The Royal Navy offers additional options to those who have been unsuccessful in their officer application within their chosen branch. As an example, unsuccessful Air Engineering SUY and SUY(WO) candidates are informed that applications for other shortage branches, such as Weapon Engineering, are welcomed and will not adversely affect further applications in their source Branch.</p><p> </p><p>Typically, over a third of Royal Navy Officer corps are recruited via the UY/SUY route. The Royal Navy will continue to review extraction routes for ratings to become Officers and the Service remains committed to ensuring there are healthy promotion prospects where a Service need exists.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Army</strong></p><p>Soldiers with the potential to become Officers are identified by their performance on courses (such as the Command Leadership and Management course) and their annual appraisals. Soldiers are made aware of the opportunity to become Commissioned Officers by their Chain of Command, internal publications and initiatives such as the Potential Officer Development Programme. The number of opportunities available is dependent on the needs of the specific Army cap badges.</p><p> </p><p>The Army Reserve has always recruited a significant number of its Officers from within its cohort of other Ranks. Since March 2016 only Professionally Qualified and Specialist Officers join direct into the Officer cohort; all others wishing to join the Army Reserve as Direct Entry Officers are required to enlist as Soldiers first.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Royal Air Force (RAF)</strong></p><p>There are a number of opportunities throughout an Airman/woman’s career that provide options for personnel to explore commissioning, including through the Joint Appraisal Report system, RAF Unit Commissioning Clubs and the Branch Engineering Scheme which is a bespoke commissioning pathway for Other Rank engineers which is designed to offer academic qualification via dedicated study at RAF Cosford.
