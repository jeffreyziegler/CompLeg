The catering subsidy has been reduced by 32% since 2007 and we are working hard to reduce it further through an ambitious Change Programme.</p><p>The unpredictable nature of parliamentary business – in terms of sitting days, recesses, the length of each sitting, and the level of attendance at the House for each sitting – means that staffing costs and wastage are higher than would be the case in purely commercial catering outlets. This makes an operating loss extremely difficult to avoid.</p><p>Furthermore, catering facilities are used by a wide range of people, not just Members. Venues such as the River Restaurant and Millbank House cafeteria are mainly intended to provide facilities for staff and other users such as the Metropolitan Police, contractors and others working on the Parliamentary Estate. It is good practice for large employers to provide cafeteria facilities for staff, particularly for organisations that operate outside normal office hours as is the case in the House of Lords. We pay all catering staff at least the London Living Wage and provide them with workplace pensions. We are proud to do so but it means our costs are higher than some commercial restaurants.</p><p>Given these factors, some element of tax-payer funding is appropriate, but the Administration is vigilant to ensure that public money is stewarded responsibly. Catering and Retail Services are also exploring novel ways to generate income in quieter times, such as opening the Peers’ Dining Room to the public in longer recesses.

This estimate does not refer to just exports as it is based on total trade opportunities which include imports.</p><br /><p>HMG has long recognised that there are barriers to trade and that Government has a role to play in helping firms overcome barriers to trade such as language skills and cultural awareness. UKTI provides a range of services to help companies address barriers to trade including language and culture issues in order to break into new or additional markets, or to increase their overseas presence. UKTI has a network of domestic and overseas trade advisors who help firms navigate barriers and trade internationally. The services offered by UKTI include bespoke help and advice plus a number of services. Amongst these services there are two specifically aimed at helping firms tackle language barriers. The Export Communications Review is a bespoke service to help companies address language barriers in all forms of communication including spoken, written, visual and digital; and “Web Optimisation for International Trade” are workshops that help firms make their websites fit for international business.

The Treasury has fully considered the two proposals put to them for addressing the shortfall of land restoration on abandoned Scottish coal mines: an exemption from the Carbon Price Support (CPS) tax and a direct grant from the Exchequer. Following discussions with Hargreaves, the UK Coal Authority, the Scotland Office, the Scottish Government and DECC, the Treasury has had to decline both proposals after thorough consideration. The reasons for this include: - Addressing the shortfall in land restoration is not the responsibility of the UK Government. Environmental protection is a devolved matter, and outstanding land restoration liabilities lie with the relevant local authorities. - The proposals are unaffordable in the current fiscal climate. They would also set a precedent that would risk discouraging companies and local authorities from making proper financial provision for the cost of site restoration and future environmental liabilities. - A CPS exemption would be an inefficient means of addressing the shortfall of land restoration, as the money would not go directly towards this aim and it would incur significant administration costs. - A CPS exemption would distort the market by making non-exempt coal less competitive, and by discouraging investment in low carbon power generation.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420635","Ministry of Defence","false","2015-10-20","<p>The Army is delivering its recruiting operations in partnership with Capita through the Recruiting Partnering Project (RPP). In January 2014 a number of steps were taken by the Ministry of Defence to improve recruiting performance. These were set out by the former Defence Secretary, the right hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Philip Hammond) in his statement on 14 January 2014 (Official Report, column 715). Since that statement, good progress has been made and a number of criteria for the achievement of Full Operating Capability have been met, but the go-live date for the ICT system has been delayed and is now scheduled for no later than April 2016.</p><br /><p>The financial benefits of the RPP are measured by comparing the cost of operating the service compared with the original financial baseline used by the project. Actual versus planned savings for the financial years (FY) 2012-13 to 2014-15 are as follows:</p><br /><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Savings (£ million)</p></td><td><p><br>2012-13</p></td><td><p><br>2013-14</p></td><td><p><br>2014-15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Planned</p></td><td><p>-3.4</p></td><td><p>20.6</p></td><td><p>32.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Actual</p></td><td><p>40.9</p></td><td><p>-4.9</p></td><td><p>-43.3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><p>Capita has been subject to the full contractual performance regime since the end of July 2015, and is now responsible for all interim costs until the new ICT solution is delivered. Forecast benefits across the life of the project have now reduced to around £220 million. The project costs remain within the original approval.</p><br /><p>The revised planned savings to be delivered under RPP between FY 2015-16 and 2021-22 are now as follows:</p><br /><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Savings (£ million)</p></td><td><p>2015-16</p></td><td><p>2016-17</p></td><td><p>2017-18</p></td><td><p>2018-19</p></td><td><p>2019-20</p></td><td><p>2020-21</p></td><td><p>2021-22</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Planned</p></td><td><p>-13.0</p></td><td><p>19.0</p></td><td><p>33.9</p></td><td><p>39.4</p></td><td><p>45.5</p></td><td><p>54.3</p></td><td><p>38.3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>These figures correct those in the answer given by my hon.

In January 2014 a number of steps were taken by the Ministry of Defence to improve recruiting performance. These were set out by the former Defence Secretary, the right hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Philip Hammond) in his statement on 14 January 2014 (Official Report, column 715). Since that statement, good progress has been made and a number of criteria for the achievement of Full Operating Capability have been met, but the go-live date for the ICT system has been delayed and is now scheduled for no later than April 2016.</p><br /><p>The financial benefits of the RPP are measured by comparing the cost of operating the service compared with the original financial baseline used by the project.

Forecast benefits across the life of the project have now reduced to around £220 million. The project costs remain within the original approval.</p><br /><p>The revised planned savings to be delivered under RPP between FY 2015-16 and 2021-22 are now as follows:</p><br /><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Savings (£ million)</p></td><td><p>2015-16</p></td><td><p>2016-17</p></td><td><p>2017-18</p></td><td><p>2018-19</p></td><td><p>2019-20</p></td><td><p>2020-21</p></td><td><p>2021-22</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Planned</p></td><td><p>-13.0</p></td><td><p>19.0</p></td><td><p>33.9</p></td><td><p>39.4</p></td><td><p>45.5</p></td><td><p>54.3</p></td><td><p>38.3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>These figures correct those in the answer given by my hon.

When the Government brought forward measures from the summer 2014 ‘Technical consultation on planning’ we undertook to further consider the case for extending the office to residential reforms, which are helping to provide more new homes on brownfield land. These rights are being used, with almost 4,900 applications received by councils in the five quarters ending June 2015 and 4,000 approved during the same period, without needing to go through the whole planning process.</p><p>Given the extensive use of the right, I can confirm that the Government intends to make permanent the permitted development right that provides for offices to change to residential use and extend the right to allow for demolition of the office and replacement by new housing on a like for like basis. This has the potential to allow for a new building to better accommodate new homes and improve design quality. We will allow for those applicants who already have prior approval or who secure a new prior approval to have three years from the date of their approval in which to complete the change of use.</p><p>Those areas that are currently exempt from the office to residential permitted development right, such as the City of London, the London Central Activities Zone and Central Manchester will remain so until May 2019. This will provide time for local authorities with exemptions to bring forward an Article 4 direction in line with national policy for these areas if they wish. Alongside this, we will also bring forward new permitted development rights for three years that allow buildings up to 500m2 used for light industry compatible with housing, to change to residential use. There will also be a permanent right for launderettes of up to 150m2 to change to residential. These changes will further increase the contribution to housing delivery and reduce unnecessary planning regulations.</p><p>These permitted development rights allow more development to take place without the need for a planning application. They will be subject to prior approval, allowing consideration by the local planning authority of specific planning matters.</p>","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis",,"2015-10-13T15:03:08.67Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/419879/answer","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/419879/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/419879/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2015-10-09","Change of Use","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what assessment his Department has made of the merits of (a) extending and (b) making permanent permitted development rights to convert offices to residential buildings.","false","Biography information for Mike Freer","Finchley and Golders Green","Mike Freer","11024"
