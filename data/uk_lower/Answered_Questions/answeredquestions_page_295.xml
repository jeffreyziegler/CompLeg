A child’s experience in the early years has a major impact on their future outcomes and social mobility. On 20 October, the department published the early years foundation stage profile (EYFSP) results for the 2015 to 2016 academic year, at national and local authority level. At a national level, 69.3% of children achieved a good level of development, which is an increase of 3 percentage points on 2015 (compared to 66.7% in the North West, which also represents an increase of 3 percentage points on the North West’s 2015 data). The latest EYFSP results are available at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-results-2015-to-2016" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/statistics/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-results-2015-to-2016</a></p><p> </p><p>High quality early education is key to future outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged children. That is why we are working hard to ensure parents and children - wherever they live in England - have access to high quality early years education places through the funded 15 hour entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds and the universal 15 hours entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds. At present, 84% of all two-year-olds (compared with 84% in the North West) and 86% of all three- and four-years-olds (compared to 88% in the North West) take up their entitlement in a good or outstanding setting.</p><p>From September 2017, working parents who meet the eligibility criteria will also have access to an additional 15 hours of funded early education. Our proposed early years funding formula includes an additional needs factor - to better target funding towards local authorities with a higher relative proportion of children with additional needs - and an area cost adjustment to reflect local operating costs. This will help to ensure that all children can access quality early education in their area.</p><p>The government is taking further steps to understand the regional attainment gap. In May 2016, the department commissioned a feasibility study to investigate the regional gap in early years at age 5, including recommendations to undertake a further study through longitudinal analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study (MSC) to assess variation in attainment and evaluate the potential drivers of a regional gap.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2016-11-28T16:59:59.133Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638659/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638659/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638659/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-11-18","Pre-school Education: North West","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking to reduce the difference in attainment for children under five between the North West and the national average.","false","Biography information for Graham Evans","Weaver Vale","Graham Evans","53792"

This track will cover a wide range of STEM occupations that require both a substantial body of technical knowledge and a set of practical skills. A new framework of 15 technical education routes will include areas such as engineering and manufacturing, health and science, and digital, with a strong STEM focus.</p><p> </p><p>Apprenticeships also play an important role in addressing the gap in skills within the STEM workforce. There are an increasing number of STEM apprenticeships, such as in construction, advanced engineering, engineering environmental technologies, energy and utilities, and space engineering. As set out in the funding guidance published on 25 October 2016, we are delivering a funding system that increases the quality and the quantity of apprenticeships in England overall, ensuring that the system is clear, works for all employers and supports high-quality training. This includes additional funding for STEM apprenticeships to recognise their higher cost and value.</p><p> </p><p>The establishment of new National Colleges to address skills gaps in sectors critical to the economy and the drive for higher-quality apprenticeships will also provide more opportunities for people to acquire the advanced technical skills that industries need.</p><p> </p><p>We are also raising awareness amongst children of the range of careers that science and technical qualifications offer, and providing stimulating scientific activities to increase their interest in STEM subjects. This includes the STEM Ambassadors programme, a nationwide network of over 29,000 volunteers, 40% of whom are women, from science, engineering and technical companies or academia, who work with schools across the UK. We are also committed to increasing the number of people taking STEM A-levels by improving the quality of teaching of those subjects and providing support to schools to increase the proportion of girls’ A-level entries in mathematics and science.</p>","Harlow","Robert Halfon",,"2016-11-24T13:19:52.97Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638661/answer","Biography information for Robert Halfon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638661/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638661/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-11-18","STEM Subjects: Females","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, how (a) her Department's plans for post-16 education, (b) the Post-16 Skills Plan and (c) the apprenticeship levy will provide improved support for women to (i) take up and (ii) continue participating in STEM subjects.","false","Biography information for Gordon Marsden","Blackpool South","Gordon Marsden","53833"

The local trade team arranges a host of seminars and events across Greater Manchester and the North West to help businesses explore overseas opportunities. For example, specifically for new exporters, there will be a First Steps to Export workshop at the Hollinwood Business Centre in Oldham on 7<sup>th</sup> December. Also, new Oldham exporters in engineering and other sectors can take advantage of Northern Powerhouse market taster visits to European markets from January to March 2017.</p><p>Integrated with all of this support, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is also funding the Greater Manchester Export Fund. This runs through to March 2017, and provides grants and loans to Oldham businesses that are investing in export related projects. So far 6 Oldham companies, 5 of which are in the manufacturing sector, have successfully applied for grants or loans totalling over £1 million. All of these companies are working with an International Trade Adviser to support their respective export plans.</p><p>UK Export Finance (UKEF) also offers finance and insurance to help UK-based exporters of all sizes and across all sectors, including engineering companies in Oldham. Engineering is an important sector for the UK economy and UKEF can work with engineering firms to help them win, fulfil and get paid for overseas sales. UKEF’s North West based Export Finance Advisers act as local points of contact to introduce businesses with export potential to finance providers, credit insurers, insurance brokers, trade support bodies and sources of Government support.</p>","Wyre Forest","Mark Garnier",,"2016-11-28T17:45:54.03Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638762/answer","Biography information for Mark Garnier","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638762/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638762/answer",,,,,"202","International Trade","International Trade","2016-11-18","Engineering: Exports","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for International Trade, what support is available to engineering companies in Oldham wishing to export to new markets.","false","Biography information for Jim McMahon","Oldham West and Royton","Jim McMahon","53710"

In English, children are taught to read well and read widely, and write with accuracy and confidence. The new English language GCSE places greater emphasis on demonstration of accurate, spelling, punctuation and grammar. Students must be able read a wide range of texts fluently, write effectively, and demonstrate sound use of Standard English. There is a much stronger emphasis across the mathematics curriculum on fundamental mathematics and numeracy. Children must be fluent in written and mental arithmetic by the end of primary school and the new mathematics GCSE offers greater assurance that all students master the numeracy required for work and life.</p><p> </p><p>In the upper secondary phase, since 2014 we have required every 16-19 year old yet to achieve a C grade or higher in GCSE English and mathematics to continue to study towards them. This has significantly increased the numbers of students successfully resitting their mathematics and English GCSEs. This summer, over 51,200 GCSE mathematics exams sat by students aged 17 and over were graded A*-C, up from 30,000 in 2012 before the requirement was in place. For English, the equivalent figures were 34,500 in 2016, up from 21,100 in 2012.</p><p> </p><p>To ensure those who leave school without having achieved a good pass at GCSE get a second chance, we have embedded English and mathematics into the heart of all our major programmes, including apprenticeships and traineeships. We strengthened apprenticeship requirements in 2014 so that all apprentices study Level 2 English and/or mathematics if they already have a Level 1 in those subjects prior to starting their apprenticeship. Alongside reforms to general qualifications, we are reforming functional skills to make mathematics and English rigorous and relevant to employer needs.</p><p> </p><p>We also fully fund all adults to achieve their first English and mathematics GCSE, as well as other qualifications that help them attain that level, and we continue to invest in research to determine which interventions deliver the best results for different groups of learners. In 2014, we set up the Behavioural Research Centre for Adult Skills and Knowledge with the Behavioural Insights Team to better understand the often complex blend of motivations and barriers to adults developing basic skills. Early trials are showing promising results. For example, a simple text messaging intervention can reduce mid-term drop out amongst basic skills learners in college by 36% and can increase students passing all their exams by 12%.</p>","Harlow","Robert Halfon",,"2016-11-22T11:27:11.99Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638351/answer","Biography information for Robert Halfon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638351/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/638351/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-11-17","Basic Skills","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to the report by the OECD entitled, Building Skills for All: A Review of England, published in February 2016, whether her Department has taken steps in response to that report to increase levels of literacy and numeracy in England.","false","Biography information for Gloria De Piero","Ashfield","Gloria De Piero","53687"

This budget is set in line with the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change and has been widely welcomed by the business community for the certainty it gives in our move to a low carbon economy. The creation of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will enable a whole economy approach to delivering our climate change ambitions.</p><p> </p><p>I attended COP22 in Marrakech this year. The UK played a significant role in driving forward negotiations and discussions – particularly on mobilising climate finance.

The UK also announced participation in a number of initiatives, including: supporting developing countries to implement their Paris commitments, tackling air pollution and investing further in research and development. For the first time at a COP, the UK had a Green is GREAT pavilion, showcasing British public and private sector strengths in responding to the challenges of climate change, including innovative commercial solutions and financial expertise.</p><p> </p><p>The UK is supporting vulnerable countries to take action against climate change. The UK will provide at least £5.8bn from the UK aid budget between 2016 and 2020 as climate finance which will continue to provide strong support to help vulnerable developing countries adapt to climate change and take up sustainable, low carbon, resilient and inclusive development. This includes technical assistance and capacity building to help countries implement their national plans under the Paris Agreement. UK climate finance to date has already directly supported 21 million people to cope with the effects of climate change, and improved access to energy for 6.6 million people. The finance has also helped prevent 4.9 million tonnes of CO2, this is roughly equivalent to emissions from 1 million vehicles driven for one year.</p><p> </p><p>We have also recently seen two significant global climate deals that – although separate from the UNFCCC process – will be important steps towards meeting the Paris goals.
