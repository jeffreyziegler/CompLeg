These include:</p><p>- in order to further support the National Health Service and local communities, the Government provided £2 million to make PADs more widely available and to increase the number of people trained in CPR. The Government provided £1 million in the 2015 Budget to increase the availability and accessibility of PADs and numbers trained in CPR; this led to 700 more PADs in communities across England; and</p><p>- in the March 2016 Budget, a further £1 million was made available to make PADs and CPR more widely available in communities across England.</p><p> </p><p>Beyond the recent central funding initiatives, since the end of the Department’s National Defibrillator Programme in 2007 PADs are also funded privately or by charities.

All reports submitted to Action Fraud are processed through an automated triage system that is designed to ensure that resources are targeted at those cases that have the most viable lines of enquiry. An automated process is required due to the large number of cases received (approximately 42,000 per month) to provide an efficient and effective response.</p><p>Crime reports to Action Fraud are assessed and triaged through the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) data analytics system which identifies links between seemingly unconnected fraud and cyber crime incidents from all over the country. Having received a report, the first phase of the crime assessment is automated using a computer based algorithm which scores the report’s suitability to be investigated against a number of criteria. This triaging ensures a consistent national approach to the assessment of fraud and cyber crime reports and effective targeting of resources. Some of these criteria include the victim’s vulnerability, whether the identity of the offender is known, if there is evidence available to support this (e.g. a confirmed bank account money has been paid to), or the volume of reports made about a specific offender. <br> <br>Reports with the highest viability scoring are then referred for further action by a crime reviewer. The crime reviewers will then undertake further work to identify whether there are sufficient lines of enquiry for the matter to be disseminated to law enforcement. Where opportunities for further action are identified, these crimes are referred to a local police force or other partner agency.</p><p>During the financial year 2017/2018 there were a total 294,984 reports.

The Home Office provides funding to local authorities via a tariff payment per person. The year one tariff is £8,520 for direct local authority costs. The costs over years two to five taper from £5,000 per person in their second year in the UK, to £1,000 per person in year five.</p><p>There is also an exceptional cases fund to assist the most vulnerable refugees. This funding is available to help local authorities with exceptional costs such as social care and housing adaptations.</p><p>Where UNHCR refer refugees with existing family links to the UK and the UK accepts them for resettlement, we endeavour to resettle them as close as possible to their existing family members, subject to suitable accommodation and support being available.</p><p>The funding provided to UNHCR covers the processing and referral of refugees arriving under the VPRS.
