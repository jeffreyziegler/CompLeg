The Defra ‘Sea Angling 2012’ research project found that, in 2012, sea anglers resident in England spent £1.23 billion on the sport. It is not possible robustly to separate out figures specifically for recreational bass fishing.</p><p>Bass conservation measures have been introduced by the EU in response to advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea on the very poor state of the stock. Alongside a significant reduction in commercial landings, these measures are aimed at reducing mortality while the stock recovers, in order to secure the long term future of bass fisheries. The EU measures from 2015 onwards were also applied to the recreational sector as scientific advice in 2014 indicated on the basis of earlier angling surveys that up to 25% of total bass removals were estimated at that time to be accounted for by bass anglers.</p><p>A specific cost estimate of the effects of the EU bass recovery measures on the recreational sector by limiting retention of catch by anglers has not been conducted. Arriving at a reliable assessment, particularly given that catch and release activity has not been restricted, would be challenging. There would need to be a wide range of factors covered in such an evaluation, including the reduced availability of bass while stocks are recovering, and the need to take into account the longer term costs of failing to apply sufficient bass recovery measures across all fishing sectors. This places the emphasis on ensuring recovery measures are in place that will restore the value of bass fisheries across all fishing sectors.</p><p> </p>","Camborne and Redruth","George Eustice","105168","2017-10-12T16:47:06.367Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/760082/answer","Biography information for George Eustice","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/760082/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/760082/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2017-09-13","Angling","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what estimate he has made of the value of recreational bass fishing in England to the economy in each of the last 10 years for which figures are available.","false","Biography information for Mr Ben Bradshaw","Exeter","Mr Ben Bradshaw","10364"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/760181","Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","false","2017-10-12","<p>In 1996 the Australia Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) signed a contract with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) for the processing of spent nuclear fuel from the Australian research reactor at the Dounreay reprocessing facility. The contract contained an obligation to return uranium and an option to return waste which is supported by a MoU between the UK and Australian Governments in the form of an intergovernmental letter. The radioactive waste, which arose from the processing, comprises several tens of drums of cemented waste. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the material when it became owners of Dounreay in 2005.</p><p> </p><p>Cemented waste is challenging in terms of transport and volume, and for the ANSTO waste the return would require multiple moves or the provision of new flasks to ensure transport can be secured. The Scottish and UK Governments consulted on a proposed policy of radioactive waste substitution for the radioactive waste arising from historic fuel reprocessing contracts with overseas customers at Dounreay in 2010. Agreement was reached between the Scottish and UK Governments on 16 March 2012. Waste substitution is an internationally accepted practice where a radiological equivalent amount of waste is returned to the customer in a form that is acceptable. A contract was signed in 2014 with the NDA to enable waste substitution.</p><p> </p><p>The substituted radioactive waste will be in the form of four vitrified residue containers holding waste which falls within the activity levels of Intermediate Level Waste. The vitrified residue (sealing of radioactive waste in molten glass poured into engineered stainless steel containers) comes from Sellafield. Waste in this form is immobilised. The cemented drums containing the Australian-origin radioactive waste from the processing of the spent nuclear fuel will be retained and managed at Dounreay pending final disposal, as the Dounreay Intermediate Level Waste stores are designed to accept it.</p><p> </p><p>The vitrified residues are forecast to be returned to Australia by 2022 and are expected to be stored in an authorised storage facility located at Lucas Heights near Sydney, where the Australian research reactor is located. Following storage at Lucas Heights the vitrified residues will be co-located with a new disposal facility for Low Level Waste and will be temporary stored at that facility.</p><p> </p><p>The Australian Government accepts that it has an international obligation to receive the vitrified residues. The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (DIIS) is charged with identifying a site – National Radioactive Waste Management Facility – for its Low Level Waste currently stored in 100 different places around Australia. The NDA has been informed that following a public consultation process across Australia, DIIS is now actively engaged in dialogue with two communities in South Australia – Wallerberdina Station, near Hawker, and at Kimba.
