To support this on the 16 June the Department for Education issued new information and advice for schools and teachers on pupils' mental health and behaviour. This advice helps school staff identify those pupils who may have emerging problems and provides guidance on appropriate routes of ensuring specialist support where necessary.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The curriculum gives schools the freedom to address any specific pastoral issues that pupils may have, and teachers can raise awareness of mental health issues in PSHE lessons. Additionally, many schools provide targeted assessment and support.

In addition, Ofsted has implemented a more rigorous inspection framework, with performance data being used to target inspections on the weakest schools and a recognition that any school less than ‘good' is not performing well enough.</p><p> </p><p>From 2016 we will introduce new measures that focus on the progress made by every child aged between 4 and 19. By focusing on progress, we will be able to identify high- and low-performing schools more accurately. Primary schools will report pupils' progress between the age of 4 and 11 and the proportion reaching the demanding new standard at age 11.

There were no A&amp;E attendances recorded with a patient group for deliberate self-harm for Wolverhampton PCT in 2009-10. Patient group is a non-mandatory field and nil entry may indicate that the PCT did not submit any data for patient group for this year.</p><p>2. PCT of main provider:</p><p>This indicates the PCT area within which the organisation providing treatment was located. The following PCTs were identified as having an A&amp;E department located within Greater Birmingham:</p><p>5PG - Birmingham East and North PCT</p><p>5PE - Dudley PCT</p><p>5MX - Heart of Birmingham Teaching PCT</p><p>5M1 - South Birmingham PCT</p><p>5M3 - Walsall Teaching PCT</p><p>5MV - Wolverhampton City PCT</p><p>Data for Sandwell and Solihull PCTs is not included due to the PCTs not submitting A&amp;E data to Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) for the time period covered.</p><p> </p><p>3. PCT of treatment 2013-14 data:</p><p>Although PCTs ceased to exist after 31 March 2013, HES A&amp;E data for 2013-14 still contains data for PCT of treatment. The relationship between providers and their respective PCTs as at the end of 2012-13 has been propagated through to 2013-14 data to allow the relevant PCT to be reported, continuing a time series.</p><p>4. Provisional data:</p><p>The data is provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than those generated for the same period in the final dataset. This shortfall will be most pronounced in the final month of the latest period, ie November from the (month 9) April to November extract. It is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been investigated and corrected.</p><p>5. Accessing growth through time (A&amp;E):</p><p>HES figures are available from 2007-08 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage and changes in National Health Service practice. For example, changes in activity may be due to changes in the provision of care.</p><p>6.

We also believe that the accounting methodology must be proportionate in the burden placed on suppliers. The European Commission's proposals for a greenhouse gas intensity accounting methodology to implement Article 7a failed to receive agreement in 2012, and we await the publication of a revised proposal and impact assessment.</p><p> </p><p>The Department consulted on measures to implement Article 7(a –e) of the Directive between March and June 2011. The core costs envisaged in the impact assessment relate to putting in place a 6% greenhouse gas emissions savings target to 2020, the supply of biofuels and other compliance measures required to achieve these reductions. The costs of delivering such measures are subject to a very high degree of uncertainty given that EU negotiations on key elements for implementing the Directive have not yet concluded. Based on a range of provisional assumptions, it was estimated that, relative to the cost of policy currently in place, the impact in 2020 would be an increase of 0.5 pence per litre on petrol and 2.5 pence per litre on road diesel.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76284","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2014-09-18","<p> </p><p><em>Labour’s legacy</em></p><p>The last Labour Government had a policy of actively pushing fortnightly bin collections and hitting hard-working families with new bin charges. Their ‘Household Waste Prevention Policy Side Research Programme’ advocated “collection limitations in terms of rubbish bin size or the interval between collections”, and sought to “nationalise this policy among local authorities”. Cutting weekly rubbish collections was not a locally-led initiative, but an explicit Whitehall mission pursued with the zeal of a convert.</p><p>Legislation in 2005 allowed the introduction of bin fines for minor breaches of complex and confusing bin rules; further legislation in 2008 watered down councils’ legal duties to collect rubbish. Guidance issued in 2005 advised town halls that councillors should be bullied to stop them opposing the axing of collections or proposing to restore weekly collections. It also recommended that cutting collections should be done after local elections – to avoid the nuisance of democratic opposition. The Government funded the covert imposition of “bin brother” microchips into families’ bins. The 2009 Pre-Budget Report made clear that a further wave of bin cuts were being planned. In short, the “Town Hall Talibin” doubled council tax and halved bin collections.</p><p>We disagree. This Government believes that households deserve a frequent and comprehensive rubbish and recycling service in return for the £122 a month in council tax that a typical household pays (Band D), especially given the typical refuse collection service only costs councils £6 to £7 per month to provide.</p><p><em>What we’ve done</em></p><p>We have taken a series of steps to help households:</p><p> </p><p>· Issued the first ever Whitehall guidance on weekly bin collections, demolishing the myths that fortnightly bin collections are needed to save money or increase recycling;</p><p> </p><p>· Stopped the Audit Commission inspections which marked down councils who do not adopt fortnightly rubbish collections, and rejected the Audit Commission guidance which advocated fortnightly collections (<em>Waste Management: The Strategic Challenge</em> and <em>Waste Management Quick Guide</em>).</p><p> </p><p>· Abolished the Local Area Agreements and National Indicator 191 imposed by Whitehall which created perverse incentives to downgrade waste collection services;</p><p> </p><p>· Scrapped the Whitehall requirement for municipal Annual Efficiency Statements, which allowed a reduction in the frequency of a household rubbish collection service to qualify as a “valid efficiency” and allowed revenue from bin fines to classed as a “cashable efficiency gain”;</p><p> </p><p>· Scrapped the imposition of eco-towns which would have had fortnightly bin collections and/or bin taxes as part of the “eco-standards”;</p><p> </p><p>· Safeguarded weekly collections for 6 million households through the Weekly Collection Support Scheme as well as championing innovation and best practice;</p><p> </p><p>· Supported over 40 innovative reward schemes to back recycling through the Weekly Collection Support Scheme (as pledged in the Coalition Agreement);</p><p> </p><p>· Through the Localism Act, revoked the 2008 legislation that allowed for the imposition of new bin taxes;</p><p> </p><p>· Issued guidance to stop the imposition of illegal ‘backdoor bin charging’ on households bins;</p><p> </p><p>· Stopped funding the ‘Waste Improvement Network’ which told councils to adopt fortnightly collections as best practice;</p><p> </p><p>· Challenged the incorrect interpretation by some bodies that European Union directives require fortnightly collections, and resisted the imposition of bin taxes by the European Union;</p><p> </p><p>· Removing powers of entry and snooping powers from “Binquisition” inspectors and scrapped guidance telling councils to rifle through families’ bins;</p><p> </p><p>· Changing building regulations to tackle ‘bin blight’; and</p><p> </p><p>· Changing the law through the Deregulation Bill to scrap unfair bin fines.</p><p>In short, this has been a fundamentally different approach from the Labour Government: we are working with families to help them go green, but believe in proper, regular and comprehensive collections for taxpaying households.</p><p>The configuration of services is complex. The attached tables, based on available estimates from WRAP, provide the most detailed information held on the breakdown of refuse and recycling collections of ‘smelly’ rubbish across councils in England.</p><p>This shows that 14 million households in England have some form of weekly collection of smelly rubbish. Had the Government not taken the actions it had, weekly collections would have disappeared in England by 2015. This simple assertion can be illustrated by the extinction of weekly collections in most of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which have devolved Administrations and policies of supporting fortnightly bin collections. Indeed, in Wales, the Labour-led Welsh Government now has a policy of supporting monthly bin collections (Welsh Government, <em>Municipal Sector Plan Part 1</em>, March 2011 and Welsh Government, <em>Cabinet decision, Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development, Additional Funding for Zero Waste Gurnos</em>, February 2012).</p><p>We have stopped the rot, but there is more to do to support weekly bin collections. Many town hall jobsworths, over-zealous NGOs and vested interests in the waste industry remain blindly obsessed with restricting bin collections as a perverse policy goal in itself, and this is reflected in the figures in the table above. Indeed, even Keep Britain Tidy – which one would think would want regular rubbish collections to keep the streets clean – has been taken over by a NGO (Waste Watch) which campaigns for fortnightly bin collections. Bin collections are not viewed as a public service – but as a policy tool to deliver other arbitrary policy goals.</p><p><em>More to do</em></p><p>One option which should be considered is a minimum service standard – for example, the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 already lays down minimum service requirements for recycling, and indeed, the Public Health Act 1875 introduced a duty on local authorities to collect rubbish; this duty was enhanced by the Public Health Act 1936 obliging them to collect household waste weekly which existed until 1974.</p><p>Moving forward, we are open to representations on how best to support frequent and comprehensive rubbish and recycling service; stand up for taxpayers’ interests from arbitrary state charges and taxes; and protect the local environment, public health and local amenity from the nuisance of stinking rubbish.</p><p> </p>","Keighley","Kris Hopkins",,"2014-09-18T16:36:13.586975Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76284/answer","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76284/answer","0334 Evans - Table.docx","0334 Evans - Table.docx","Waste Collection Tables","Waste Collection Tables","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76284/answer","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76284/answer/previousversion/10059","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-07-08","Waste Disposal","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what support his Department provides to local authorities who wish to retain weekly general waste collections.","false","Biography information for Mr Nigel Evans","Ribble Valley","Mr Nigel Evans","204411"

Schools have the freedom to shape these measures in the context of their pupils' needs. They are held to account by Ofsted for their effectiveness in preventing bullying, harassment and discrimination.</p><p> </p><p>Through the Education Act 2011, we strengthened teachers' powers to discipline pupils for poor behaviour, including bullying. They can now issue same day detentions, confiscate banned items and search for, and if necessary delete, inappropriate images on mobile phones which might be linked to cyberbullying. This advice was updated in February 2014 to make clear that tough but proportionate sanctions can be deployed to deal with misbehaviour, which includes bullying.

A small part of the additional funding was held centrally for Be Clear on Cancer (BCOC) symptom awareness campaigns and for some work to help support general practitioners (GPs). The rest was allocated to the National Health Service to meet the additional costs associated with tackling late diagnosis of cancer, specifically to enable increased general practitioner (GP) access to four key diagnostic tests, including magnetic resonance imaging scans to support diagnosis of brain tumours and; the increased testing, and treatment costs in secondary care associated with more people being referred and diagnosed.</p><p>In 2012, to increase the awareness of cancer among GPs and support GPs to assess patients more effectively, the Department funded the British Medical Journal Learning to provide an e-learning tool for GPs. Four modules were developed including diagnosing osteosarcoma and brain tumours in children and young people.</p><p>This module helps GPs to understand the main types of brain tumours in children and young people, and their common presentations, and to recognise when patients need urgent referral.</p><p>To date the Department and Public Health England (since April 2013), have run national BCOC campaigns to raise awareness of the following cancers - bowel, lung, bladder and kidney, and breast. Regional campaigns have also been run for ovarian and oesophago-gastric cancers. A campaign was piloted at local level to raise awareness of four key symptoms of cancer and a local skin cancer pilot is running from 16 June to 27 July in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset. Decisions on further BCOC campaign activity in 2014-15 are being made over the summer, based on the evidence and learning from previous campaigns. We will continue to keep these campaigns under review and work with relevant experts to see what might be done to tackle other cancers.</p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2014-07-14T09:41:52.3560633Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76406/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76406/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/76406/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-07-08","Brain: Tumours","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, with reference to the Answer of 1 April 2014, Official Report, column 711, on brain tumours (children), what proportion of the £450 million which the Government has committed to enable earlier diagnosis of cancer has been allocated to reduce the delay of diagnosis of brain tumours in children.","false","Biography information for Dominic Raab","Esher and Walton","Mr Dominic Raab","204635"
