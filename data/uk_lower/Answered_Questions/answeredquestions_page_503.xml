This Act creates clear statutory powers to enable all prisons to use signal denial technology to suppress the use of wireless telegraphy such as mobile phones by prisoners.</p><p>A range of mobile signal denial technology was trialled in a small number of Prisons. The trials demonstrated that the equipment is capable of denying signals to illicit mobile phones within the prison perimeter as required by law and Ofcom regulations. NOMS has since distributed 300 short range portable blockers around the prison estate.</p><p>Since April 2010, prisons have been asked to send all unauthorised phones and SIM cards found to a central unit for interrogation, or to notify the unit if an unauthorised phone or SIM card has been found but not sent for analysis.

This has seen the Department surrender six leasehold office properties through a combination of lease breaks and expiries generating net savings in the period of around £7 million per annum. The Department has also successfully sub-let surplus space across its leasehold office estate during the same period, reducing the overall property costs by around £11.1 million.</p><p>The Department has also negotiated the early surrender of Eland House and is shortly scheduled to relocate to 2 Marsham Street to share premises with the Home Office. This move will reduce our Department's running costs by a further £9 million a year and generate savings for the taxpayer of £220 million over the lifetime of the building's lease.

As a result, all of the main operators now provide ‘near data allowance' alerts to help consumers manage their data usage.

Some operators also offer spend caps to help limit any out of allowance charges that consumers may incur.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, customers who use data while abroad are protected by the Roaming Regulations.

The funding to ESA has been used to contribute to missions and technology in the fields of space science and exploration, Earth observation for science and applications, telecommunications and broadband delivery, access to microgravity facilities for life and physical sciences, space weather, navigation technologies, human spaceflight and weather monitoring. As well as resulting expenditure in the UK due to the just retour principle, wider benefits have accrued in new scientific knowledge; and improved delivery of public services.</p><p>ESA is the primary route for Government R&amp;D space investment. Several economic analyses of investment impact have been undertaken, drawn together in BIS Economics Paper No3[1]. The UK Space Agency (part of BIS) undertakes a biennial survey of the size and health of the UK space industry[2] showing growth from £3.4B turnover in 1999/2000 to £9.5B in 2011, reflecting the results of sustained investment as well as the growth of the market.</p><p>The UK Space Agency monitors contracts that return back to UK industry from our ESA subscriptions and also monitors where R&amp;D work has positioned UK industry for success in larger operational contracts.</p><p> </p><p>A UK R&amp;D investment of £15M for the Astrium E3000 Spacecraft through the ESA telecoms programme (‘ARTES') was more than matched by industry and resulted in the award of 41 spacecraft contracts worth over £600M to UK industry, an un-discounted ROI of over thirty. Analysis has shown that the return on investment from UK ARTES programmes ranges from 2 to 30 with an average of 6:1. The UK Space Agency also works with the OECD to pool analysis of benefits from space funding as reflected in the OECD Handbook on Measuring the Space Economy[3].</p><p> </p><p>The scientific programmes of ESA directly contribute to UK academic excellence. The ‘Wakeham Review of Physics'[4] reported to government that in terms of impact (citations) in the space sciences, the UK “is second to the USA and well separated from the following pack”. Data from satellites such as ESA's Cryosat 2 have directly informed the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment on climate change[5].</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An example of a public service benefit space investment is the weather forecast. The MetOffice (also part of BIS) has undertaken analysis showing that satellites have made the greatest impact in improving weather prediction among available observing techniques[6] “accounting for 64% of short-range global forecast error reduction”. Of all the nine data sources used, the new European Metop satellite has made the largest single impact: “about 25% of the total impact on global forecast error reduction”.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><br /><p>[1]http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file54519.PDF</p><p>[2] http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/ukspaceagency/docs/industry/size-and-health-report-oct-2012.pdf</p><p>[3] http://www.oecd.org/futures/oecdhandbookonmeasuringthespaceeconomy.htm</p><p>[4] http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/RCUK-prod/assets/documents/reviews/physics/review.pdf</p><p>[5] https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/</p><p>[6] http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/9/m/FRTR562.pdf</p>","Havant","Mr David Willetts",,"2014-05-08T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/49218/answer","Biography information for Lord Willetts","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/49218/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/49218/answer",,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2014-04-30","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, what funding the UK has given (a) directly and (b) indirectly to the European Space Agency in each of the last five years; what that funding was for; and what assessment he has made of the benefits arising from that funding to the UK.","false","Biography information for Sir Greg Knight","East Yorkshire","Sir Greg Knight","197364"

In 2012, the Department published ‘Direct access to diagnostic tests for cancer: best practice referral pathways for general practitioners' to provide criteria for accessing key diagnostic tests including MRI brain scans. The guide aims to raise awareness of the symptoms that require urgent referral to specialists and sets out where a direct referral for an MRI brain scan may benefit patients through achieving a faster diagnosis.

The OCC are planning to review the position later this year. Current statutory guidance on CSE says that LSCBs should ensure that specific local procedures are in place covering the sexual exploitation of children and young people and that the needs of the children affected are considered when local services are planned and commissioned.[2] LSCBs should set up a sub-group, reporting to the Board, to drive progress on CSE. The guidance does not place a requirement on LSCBs to develop a CSE strategy, but this has come to be regarded as best practice. It does, however, say:</p><p> </p><p>‘Sexual exploitation should be covered in local needs assessments and, where it is a significant issue, the LSCB should help ensure it is regarded as a priority'.</p><p> </p><p>More recently, the Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation Action Plan, published by the Department for Education in November 2011, set out actions to help LSCBs to prioritise CSE, including to ‘develop an effective local strategy ensuring there is a co-ordinated multi-agency response to child sexual exploitation, based on a robust, thorough risk assessment of the extent and nature of CSE locally'.[3]</p><p> </p><p>The Department for Education is not responsible for child protection in Wales.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>[1] If only someone had listened – final report of the Office of the Children's Commissioner's Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups, <a href="http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/publications/content_743" target="_blank">http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/publications/content_743</a></p><p> </p><p>[2]<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/278849/Safeguarding_Children_and_Young_People_from_Sexual_Exploitation.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/278849/Safeguarding_Children_and_Young_People_from_Sexual_Exploitation.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p>[3]<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation-action-plan" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation-action-plan</a></p><p> </p><p> </p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Mr Edward Timpson",,"2014-05-07T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/49343/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/49343/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/49343/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-04-30","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what proportion of local authorities in England and Wales have plans in place for tackling potential child sexual exploitation.","false","Biography information for Mr Barry Sheerman","Huddersfield","Mr Barry Sheerman","197312"

For Portsmouth Unitary Authority this figure was 5.9% in both 2010 and 2011; for Hampshire County Council this figure was 5.3% in 2010 and 5.4% in 2011; and for the South East this figure was 5.5% in both 2010 and 2011.</p><p> </p><p>PHE has also published mortality estimates for 2010 as attributable deaths[1] and associated years of life lost.

This means that it is likely that air pollution contributes a smaller amount to the deaths of a larger number of exposed individuals rather than being solely responsible for a number of deaths equivalent to the calculated figure of ‘attributable deaths'.
