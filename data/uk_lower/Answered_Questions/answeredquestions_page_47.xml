Regulated Apportionment Arrangements, a restructuring mechanism which allows a financially troubled employer to detach itself from its liabilities in respect of a defined benefit scheme, are rare and The Pensions Regulator will only agree to them if stringent criteria are met, with entry into the Pension Protection Fund the expected outcome, and the Pension Protection Fund must not object to the Regulated Apportionment Arrangements. The Pensions Regulator published a section 89 regulatory intervention report in November 2014 describing in detail the considerations leading to the decision in this case.</p><p> </p><p>As a condition of approving the successor Kodak pension scheme in 2014, a memorandum of understanding was put in place giving The Pensions Regulator the power to closely monitor the progress of the scheme and if necessary trigger its wind up. This has allowed The Pensions Regulator, with the Pension Protection Fund, to remain actively involved in discussions about the scheme’s future. Due to underperformance of the underlying business it was concluded that the scheme would be unable to meet its long term funding requirements. Action has therefore been taken to bring the scheme into a Pension Protection Fund assessment period which commenced on the 25 March 2019.</p><p> </p><p>Specialist firms with extensive Pension Protection Fund experience have been brought in to manage the administration of the pension scheme and to oversee its efficient passage through the assessment process.</p><p> </p><p>Whilst the Kodak case is a significant claim, the Pension Protection Fund remains in a robust financial position. In its last reported accounts, the Pension Protection Fund had a £6.7 billion reserve and is currently on track to reach its funding objective. There has been no immediate impact on the Pension Protection Fund Levy arising from this case. The Pension Protection Fund aims to collect £500m in levy in 2019/20 which is £50m lower than it aimed to collect in 2018/19.</p><p> </p><p>The Pensions Regulator aims to learn from every major pensions restructuring case and has refined its approach to complex pension restructurings in light of the lessons learned in the Kodak case and successive cases.

Inclusion in each group occurs when the student has the exact grades, or when three (or more) of their grades match or are higher than the required grades. Therefore, students with only 1 or 2 grades are excluded as they do not match or beat all three required grades. These figures will differ slightly from measures published for all students nationally, due to this slight methodological difference.</p><p>[4] Only includes students with pass grades (A* to E).

Gavi now supports 17 manufacturers to provide critical vaccines at a lower cost. Many of these manufacturers are now based in low and middle income countries.

This is why the law relating to the sale of knives to under 18s applies equally to in-store and online purchases. In addition, through the Offensive Weapons Bill, currently awaiting Royal Assent, we will stop knives being sent to residential addresses after they are bought online, unless the seller has arrangements in place with the delivery company to ensure that the product will not be delivered into the hands of a person under 18. This will help to ensure that purchasers cannot circumvent the existing law by buying knives online.</p><p>We have also agreed a set of commitments with major retailers to prevent the underage sales of knives more generally in their stores and online. The agreement also covers staff training and displays and packaging. Tesco, eBay UK, Lidl UK, Amazon UK, Wilko, Argos, Asda, Poundland, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, John Lewis and Waitrose have all signed up to the principles. They have since been joined by Boots, the Co-op, B&amp;Q, Aldi, TKMaxx and Debenhams. We are working with retailers to strengthen the agreement in relation to displays and that work is continuing. Following on from this, Asda have announced that they will stop selling single knives in its stores by the end of April, a move supported by the Government.</p><p>In addition, on 17 June 2018 the Home Secretary announced funding of £1.4m to support a new national police capability to tackle gang related activity on social media.

The Department does not publish estimates of the proportion of Key Stage 4 FSM pupils who go on to enter and achieve these different A level combinations by the end of 16-18 study.

Inclusion in the AAB measure refers to those who entered at least one full size A level, excluding applied A levels (this includes double award A levels, but does not include AS levels, general studies or critical thinking). If students are entered for less than three full size A levels, they are only included in the measure if they have not entered for other academic, applied general and T level qualifications greater than or equal to the size of an A level.

Inclusion in each group occurs when the student has the exact grades, or when three (or more) of their grades match or are higher than the required grades. Therefore, students with only 1 or 2 grades are excluded as they do not match or beat all three required grades. These figures will differ slightly from measures published for all students nationally, due to this slight methodological difference.</p><p>[4] Only includes students with pass grades (A* to E).

In March 2017, Ofcom consulted on introducing an automatic compensation scheme for fixed broadband and landline telecoms to protect consumers that suffer from specific service failures. Subsequently, industry agreed to introduce a voluntary automatic compensation scheme, which came into effect from 1 April 2019.

They estimate that it will benefit consumers by up to £126m more per year in compensation payments, compared to £16m per year they received previously. Ofcom is satisfied that the voluntary scheme is a fair, effective and sufficient means to ensure telecoms consumers are compensated when service quality falls short, and that it adequately addresses the need to take regulatory action in this area.

Tackling serious violence is a top priority for the Government and it is clear we must continue to step up the response to stop this violence. The Serious Violence Strategy sets out the Government’s approach, which depends on a multi-agency ‘public health’ approach across several sectors and stresses the importance of early intervention to tackle the root causes. We have also taken a number of steps towards introducing a multi-agency ‘public health’ approach to knife crime and serious violence.</p><p>On 1 April we launched a public consultation on a new legal duty to support a ‘public health’ multi-agency approach to preventing and tackling serious violence. This statutory duty would make serious violence a top priority for all key partners, ensuring that they are working together to prevent young people being caught in the criminal cycle. The consultation, which closes on 28 May, can be found on the Gov.UK website at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?departments%5B%5D=home-office&amp;publication_filter_option=consultations" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?departments%5B%5D=home-office&amp;publication_filter_option=consultations</a></p><p>On 13 March the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further £100 million funding in 2019/20 to help in the police’s immediate response to the rise in serious knife crime, enabling priority forces to immediately begin planning to put in place the additional capacity they need. £35m of this Serious Violence Fund will support the setting up of Violence Reduction Units (VRUs) in areas most affected by knife crime. The VRUs will be similar to the Glasgow model, bringing together a range of agencies including health, education, social services and others, to develop a multi-agency approach in preventing serious violence altogether.</p><p>In October 2018 the Home Secretary announced a ten-year £200m Youth Endowment Fund, focused on targeted early intervention with those children and young people most vulnerable to involvement in serious violence. This will form an important part of the multi-agency, public health; approach to serious violence.</p><p>On 1 to 4 April 2019 the Prime Minister hosted a Serious Youth Violence Summit at 10 Downing Street, with the support of the Home Secretary and Secretaries of State. The central aim of the summit was to ensure a shared understanding and commitment to a multi-agency, ‘public health’ approach to tackling knife crime and serious violence more generally. An outcome of the Summit is the creation of a new Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Prime Minister, to drive cross-government action.
