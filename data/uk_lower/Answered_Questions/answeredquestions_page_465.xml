The revised School Admissions Code currently before the House proposes extending this freedom to all state-funded schools.</p><p>In addition, we have granted school specific derogations in the following areas:</p><ul><li>46 free schools are able to give admissions priority to founders’ children. Founders’ status is granted only to those individuals who have played a material role in setting up the school and who continue to be involved in the running of the school.</li><li>Three free schools are able to give admissions priority to the children of staff without having to meet the two-year qualification in the Code.

The derogation enables children to obtain a specialist education unavailable elsewhere.</li><li>The Priory Academy, Lincoln School of Science and Technology (LSST) in Lincoln is permitted to select 10% of its intake by aptitude in technology in recognition that the predecessor school selected on this basis. A derogation was agreed so that the school did not lose its ability to select on this basis on closing and reopening as an academy in 2008.</li><li>Belvedere Academy in Liverpool became an academy in 2007. This academy’s predecessor school was an all-through fee-paying independent school. Only the secondary phase became an academy.

In addition, it significantly raised the profile of this issue and placed it firmly on the international policy agenda. Following the Summit, we are now working to implement the outcomes of the Summit and to incorporate efforts to prevent sexual violence in conflict into all aspects of international conflict prevention, stabilisation, peacebuilding, security and justice, humanitarian and human rights work. This is based on a programme of political and practical activity that includes: - Implementing the International Protocol on the Documentation and Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict through advocacy, capacity building and national application; -Encouraging governments to implement fully in domestic legislation the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and for more states to accede to the Rome Statute and to implement fully its provisions in domestic law; - Pressing governments to do more to support HRDs and building further the capacity of local civil society and grass roots organisations to document and respond to acts of sexual violence and to provide support to survivors; and - Encouraging governments to do more to include sexual violence issues in their doctrine and training and to enforce initiatives on military conduct and discipline. We are also working with and encouraging those governments who announced new plans or commitments at the Summit to implement them as fully and as quickly as possible.

Prosecutions and convictions have risen by over 10% in the last year, with the conviction rate at its highest ever level at 74.6%. <br><br>However the Government continues to actively pursue ways in which we can prevent domestic violence and abuse happening in the first place, do even more to help victims, bring perpetrators to justice and eradicate these crimes. In September 2013, the Home Secretary commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to undertake a comprehensive review on how the police deal with domestic abuse. HMIC published its findings in March 2014 and highlighted significant police failings. In response to the HMIC review, the Home Secretary has established a national oversight group to ensure that the police change the way they respond to domestic abuse and made clear to all chief constables that every police force must have an action plan in place. All forces have now produced plans that are being reviewed by HMIC.<br><br>The Government is also committed to supporting the police in tackling domestic violence and abuse, to bring offenders to justice and to ensure victims have the support they need to rebuild their lives. On 8 March, we announced the national roll-out of Domestic Violence Protection Orders and the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme across England and Wales. We have also ring-fenced <br>£40 million of funding for specialist local support services and national helplines over this Parliament. <br><br>Domestic abuse is not just about violence. Coercive and controlling behaviour can be harder to recognise but can have an equally devastating impact on its victims. In recognition of this, in March 2013 we expanded the Government definition of domestic abuse to capture non-violent behaviour. <br><br>The Government has additionally recently consulted on whether the law needs to be strengthened by making a specific offence of domestic abuse to offer the best possible protection to victims. That consultation has closed and responses are currently being analysed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Hornsey and Wood Green","Lynne Featherstone",,"2014-11-17T17:20:19.047Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/114878/answer","Biography information for Baroness Featherstone","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/114878/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/114878/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-11-05","Domestic Abuse","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps her Department has taken to improve the effectiveness of detection, prosecution and sentencing of domestic violence offences.","false","Biography information for Nigel Dodds","Belfast North","Mr Nigel Dodds","213564"

We have invested £860 million over five years through National Cyber Security Programme (NCSP). <br><br>Approximately 10% of this has been spent on building law enforcement capabilities to respond to cyber crime. This includes the establishment of the National Cyber Crime Unit in the National Crime Agency (NCA), and cyber teams within each of the Regional Organised Crime Units (ROCUs) across England and Wales. We are also bolstering the law enforcement response through the creation of bespoke fraud units in each of the ROCUs, delivered with extra Home Office funding over the past two years. <br><br>We have also brought Action Fraud, the national reporting point for fraud and financially-motivated cyber crime, into the City of London Police, the national lead force for fraud. This ensures that a single organisation is responsible for the collection and analysis of reports on these offences, and sending intelligence packages to forces for investigation. In 2013/14 City of London Police disseminated around 40,000 crimes to police forces for investigation and we are working with the City of London Police to raise this further.<br><br>We are also working closely with law enforcement, industry and third sector partners to support individuals and businesses to be better protected. This includes national and local level action to increase their awareness of the risks and adopting safe online behaviours. The Cyber Streetwise awareness campaign, funded by the NCSP, helps individuals and businesses understand how to stay safe online as does the Get Safe Online week held in October this year. The second phase of the campaign, including a refreshed website and online materials, launched last month. Action Fraud also circulates real-time information on the latest fraud threats via its website, social media channels and though police forces and businesses.

These include drug detection dogs, procedures to tackle visitors and others who seek to smuggle drugs and phones into prisons, and mobile phone detection technology. NOMS has rolled out a networked IT intelligence system and provided prisons with short range portable mobile phone blockers which will help prisons prevent prisoners using mobile phones, which are often associated with drug supply.</p><p> </p><p>The success of NOMS drug strategy is illustrated by the reduction of drug misuse - as measured by the random mandatory drug testing programme - which has declined by 17.0 percentage points over the past 17 years.

An analysis of productivity across all G7 countries has not yet been completed. The full analysis can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/34647/12-1207-benchmarking-uk-competitiveness-in-the-global-economy.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> but the main findings were:</p><p> </p><p>The analysis decomposed the productivity gap (measured by output per hour worked) into two components:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Sector productivity effect – the share of the gap arising due to productivity in a given sector being higher in another country than in the UK.</li><li>Sector mix effect – the share of the gap arising due to employment in another country being more concentrated in high productivity sectors than in the UK.</li></ul><p> </p><p>When UK productivity is compared to France, Germany and the USA, the sector productivity effect in each of the comparator countries fully explains the gap. As such, higher productivity across almost all sectors in each of these economies accounts for the entirety of their lead over the UK. In fact, the UK’s favourable sector mix went some way towards reducing the gap, particularly against France.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, the factors driving the gap vary by country. However, at the aggregate level, the UK tends to have lower capital per head than France and Germany and a less efficient use of inputs in production (Total Factor Productivity) than the USA (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/32101/10-1213-economic-growth.pdf" target="_blank">BIS, 2010</a>). There is also a (smaller) gap between the UK and its major competitors in terms of skills. This is generally characterised as a gap in intermediate skills with France and Germany, and a gap in higher level skills relative to the USA.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Plans to Improve UK Productivity</strong></p><p> </p><p>Government policy focuses on delivering growth which in turn depends on productivity in the longer term. In this sense, the majority of longer run Government economic policy is ultimately about raising productivity.</p><p> </p><p>The Government’s industrial strategy and ‘The Plan for Growth’ are creating the right environment for businesses to invest and grow.

All schools in England are required, by law, to have a behaviour policy which includes measures to tackle bullying, including cyberbullying which covers sexting.

This is made clear in our advice to schools. Good schools create an ethos where bullying, including cyberbullying and sexting do not happen in the first place, and they deal with it promptly if it does occur to ensure the victim does not suffer continuing distress.</p><p>From September 2014, e-safety is being taught at all four key stages of the curriculum in England. It covers responsible, respectful and secure use of technology, as well as ensuring that pupils are taught age-appropriate ways of reporting any concerns they may have about what they see or encounter online.</p><p>Children and young people are being taught about the different and escalating risks they may encounter as they get older (initially relating to online content, then to the conduct of and contact with others, which can include sexting).</p><p>Schools can help to contain cyber-bullying and sexting during the school day by banning or limiting the use of mobile phones and other electronic devices. Search powers included in the Education Act 2011 have given teachers the power to search for, and if necessary delete, inappropriate images (or files) on electronic devices, including mobile phones.</p><p>Ofsted now holds schools clearly to account for how well they deal with behaviour and bullying. Since January 2012, inspectors must consider pupils’ freedom from bullying, including cyberbullying, harassment and discrimination.

Cancer indicators in the NHS Outcomes Framework and the Public Health Outcomes Framework will help NHS England to assess progress in improving cancer survival and mortality for men with prostate cancer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer (2005) are available to help general practitioners (GPs) assess when it is appropriate to refer patients for suspected cancer, including prostate cancer. NICE is in the process of updating the guidelines to ensure that these reflect latest evidence and can continue to support GPs to identify patients with suspected cancer symptoms and urgently refer them as appropriate. NICE’s anticipated publication date for the revised guidelines is May 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At a local level, it is for individual clinical commissioning groups to promote and enhance the diagnostic capability to deliver better outcomes. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments that may be used for prostate cancer are commissioned at the moment by NHS England. NHS England’s prostate cancer service specification clearly defines what it expects to be in place for providers to offer evidence-based, safe and effective prostate cancer services. This service specification has been developed by specialised clinicians, commissioners, expert patients and public health representatives to describe core and developmental service standards.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NICE published an updated clinical guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in January 2014. NICE has recommended docetaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide as treatment options for some types of prostate cancer, subject to certain clinical criteria and is currently appraising a number of other prostate cancer drugs. Patients have the right to drugs and treatments that have been recommended by NICE technology appraisal guidance for use in the National Health Service, where their doctor believes they are clinically appropriate. A number of drugs to treat prostate cancer are available through the Cancer Drugs Fund.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To help reduce regional variations, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is increasingly incorporating information from accreditation and peer review programmes into its assessments of NHS trusts' services for the treatment of prostate cancer. This includes the national cancer peer review programme, which encompasses prostate cancer. The cancer patient survey also asks specific questions on having a specialist nurse. The CQC intends to use data from the national clinical audit which is being developed for prostate cancer. In addition, national statistics on waiting times experienced by patients with suspected and diagnosed cancers continue to be collected, monitored and published in order to improve equity of access to cancer services and to contribute to an improvement in survival rates.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This Government is also investing in innovative radiotherapy treatments to improve outcomes for those with cancer. NHS England has also committed to make up to £6 million available over the next three years to support six trials by Cancer Research UK into the use of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). This will allow patients to receive SABR treatment now, where clinicians think they could benefit. At the same time doctors can fully assess the effectiveness of these treatments so that in future, if it proves to be effective, they will be available for all relevant patients on the NHS. Two of these six trials will be on prostate cancer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have also invested £23 million across 50 United Kingdom centres aimed at increasing the capacity of radiotherapy centres in England to deliver Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT). We committed to achieving the ambition of 24% of all radiotherapy to be delivered through more accurate IMRT, and we are now seeing 35% of all radical radiotherapy treatments delivered using this method compared to 5% in 2010.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Prostate Cancer Audit (NCPA) First Year Annual Report was published on the 10 November. The report covers the work undertaken since April 2013. It includes a preliminary analysis of the NPCA’s organisational audit, an analysis of existing data sets including patients with prostate cancer in England, and the design of the NPCA’s prospective audit dataset. The findings from the audit will contribute to changes in clinical practice ensuring that patients receive the best care possible and experience an improved quality of life.
