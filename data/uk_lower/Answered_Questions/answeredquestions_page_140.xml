This new code will help empower parents and carers to make informed decisions when selecting a martial arts club or provider for their child. The Code was developed by Sport England through close consultation with representatives from martial arts governing bodies, the Child Protection in Sport Unit and those with years of expertise in safeguarding. Clubs and providers can pledge to work towards the Code now, with the Code becoming fully operational in the summer.</p>","Chatham and Aylesford","Tracey Crouch",,"2018-06-06T09:27:00.18Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/915130/answer","Biography information for Tracey Crouch","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/915130/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/915130/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2018-06-01","Martial Arts: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, whether steps have been taken to improve the child protection regime in martial arts; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Helen Goodman","Bishop Auckland","Helen Goodman","148656"
