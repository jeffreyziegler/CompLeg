These were accepted in the Post-16 Skills Plan, published on 8 July 2016. Copies of both documents have been placed in the libraries of both Houses.</p><p> </p><p>The reforms will tackle longstanding issues which have affected our nation’s productivity and international competitiveness over many years. They will replace the confusing patchwork of thousands of qualifications of variable quality with fifteen routes to skilled employment. The new routes will include far fewer but consistently better qualifications. These will be shaped by industry professionals and will provide stretching technical content, delivered to industry standards.</p><p> </p><p>We plan to fund the new technical qualifications once they have been approved, and over time we expect to cease funding similar qualifications.
