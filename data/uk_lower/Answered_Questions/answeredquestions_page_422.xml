It has received funding of £38 million of the £50m capital funds from the UK Government via the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), alongside £23 million of funds from the European Regional Development Fund to help accelerate the commercialisation of graphene. The NGI was officially opened by the Chancellor, the Rt Hon George Osborne, on 20 March 2015.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>UK Government funding for the NGI</p></td><td><p> </p><p>2011/12</p></td><td><p> </p><p>2012/13</p></td><td><p> </p><p>2013/14</p></td><td><p> </p><p>2014/15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Capital</p></td><td><p>£1.35m</p></td><td><p>£2.33m</p></td><td><p>£22.64m</p></td><td><p>£11.68m</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>More than 35 companies from across the world have already chosen to partner with The University of Manchester working on graphene-related projects. University of Manchester researchers have also secured £9.5 million from EPSRC for ‘Graphene Engineering’ research projects and a Centre for Doctoral Training focussed on developing world-leading expertise in the science and technology of graphene.</p><p>In 2014, Innovate UK and EPSRC invested £2.5m in feasibility studies to accelerate commercial applications of graphene. The competition invested in projects that explored the potential of graphene to yield new products that could disrupt markets.</p><p>To build UK capacity in this area, £34m has been invested into graphene innovation capability. In 2014, £20m funding was announced (including £15m from HEFCE UK Research Partnership Investment Fund and £5m from Innovate UK) towards a £60m investment in Manchester called the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC), which is co-funded by the Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy company Masdar. UK Trade and Investment worked alongside Manchester City Council and the University of Manchester to secure this investment. Set to open in Manchester in 2017, the GEIC will complement the NGI and initiate further industry-led development in graphene applications with academic collaboration. The GEIC will contain substantial pilot production facilities and will be a leading test-bed for graphene process engineering and scale-up. It will link with international programmes for research project support, such as the €1 billion European Union Graphene Flagship.</p><p> </p><p>Also in 2014, the Chancellor announced a £14 million investment for a “Graphene Applications Innovation Centre” to be based at the Centre for Process Innovation in the north-east of England (part of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult).</p><p>Subject to the availability of funding following the Spending Review, Innovate UK intends to further support business-led innovation in graphene by running competitions to accelerate the commercial applications of graphene. An efficient, longer-lasting ‘graphene lightbulb’, developed by a University of Manchester spin-out company, is believed to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the UK.</p><p>In 2014, Innovate UK set up a Graphene Special Interest Group (SIG) to provide leadership and a focal point for the exploitation of graphene by UK industry and to help connect and align the developing UK graphene value chain. A scoping document produced for the Graphene SIG examined time to market for key graphene-enabled technologies, it can be found at:</p><p><a href="https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/10660253/14368155/Graphene%20Think%20Piece_Oct2013" target="_blank">https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/10660253/14368155/Graphene%20Think%20Piece_Oct2013</a></p><p>The table below shows the number of published patent applications in the UK (filed by applicants based anywhere in the world) and the total number worldwide.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>UK publications</p></td><td><p>Total Worldwide publications</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>2209</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>36</p></td><td><p>4573</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>62</p></td><td><p>7361</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>59</p></td><td><p>9203</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) does not hold worldwide patent data so this has been extracted from an external database, as used in the IPO’s 2015 graphene patent landscape report available from</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/419651/Graphene_-_the_worldwide_patent_landscape_in_2015_-_accessible.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/419651/Graphene_-_the_worldwide_patent_landscape_in_2015_-_accessible.pdf</a></p>","Orpington","Joseph Johnson","2261 ; 2262 ; 2263","2015-06-18T13:02:54.917Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/349958/answer","Biography information for Joseph  Johnson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/349958/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/349958/answer",,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2015-06-11","Graphene","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, how many graphene-related patent applications were filed in the UK between 2011 and 2014; and what information his Department holds on the number of such applications filed worldwide in that period.","false","Biography information for Sir Nicholas Soames","Mid Sussex","Sir Nicholas Soames","2264"

Through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme, we are also helping some of the most vulnerable Syrians who cannot be supported effectively in the region by offering them care and support in the UK, prioritising women and children at risk, people in severe need of medical care and survivors of torture and violence. The scheme runs in parallel to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR) Syrian humanitarian admission programme, as we believe we can contribute most by basing our resettlement scheme on need rather than a fulfilling a quota. However, we have said we expect the scheme to help several hundred people over three years, and we remain firmly on track to achieve that. We are working closely with the UNHCR to identify the most vulnerable displaced Syrians, and bring them to the UK. Between the first arrivals in March 2014 and the end of March this year, 187 people arrived under the scheme, and groups continue to arrive on a regular basis. This is in addition to Syrians the UK has granted asylum under our normal rules; since the crisis began in 2011, we have granted asylum or other forms of leave to over 4,200 Syrian nationals.</p><p>However, with 3.9 million displaced Syrians in Syria’s neighbouring countries and millions more in need within Syria itself, protection in the UK can only ever help a minority of those who so desperately need help. The Government strongly believes that the UK can have the greatest impact by continuing to focus our efforts on substantial humanitarian aid to help provide support to the majority of displaced people who remain in the region and ease the burden on their host countries. By the end of September last year, UK aid had delivered over 8.7 million food rations (each of which feeds one person for one month), provided access to clean water for 1.5 million people per month, and over 1.3 million medical consultations in Syria and the region. The VPR scheme, which is the first resettlement scheme operated by the UK to target beneficiaries specifically on the basis of vulnerability, complements our aid by focusing on providing support in the UK to some of the most vulnerable displaced people who cannot be supported effectively in the region.</p><p>We therefore have no current plans to participate in a quota resettlement scheme; we believe that our current approach is the best way for the UK to help people who are suffering due to the crisis.</p>",,"Lord Bates",,"2015-06-15T14:06:27.78Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/349545/answer","Biography information for Lord Bates","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/349545/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/349545/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2015-06-10","Refugees: Syria","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what further consideration have they given to taking in the quota of refugees from Syria suggested by the UN.","false","Biography information for Baroness Tonge",,"Baroness Tonge","HL414"
