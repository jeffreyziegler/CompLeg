As set out in our Housing White Paper, we propose to amend the National Planning Policy Framework to increase the emphasis on design and community engagement in local and neighbourhood plans and other development plan documents so that more certainty is given on design. This will include strengthening the importance of early pre-application discussions about design and the types of homes to be provided and recognising the value of using a widely accepted design standard, such as Building for Life, in shaping and assessing basic design principles. We will also make further funding available to neighbourhood planning groups from 2018-2021 so they can access support they might need including for better design and provide new funding to boost the capacity and capability of local authorities. We are also planning to diversify the market to encourage wider use of custom build which enables homebuyers to be directly involved in the design of their new home.</p>",,"Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth",,"2017-03-21T16:03:34.913Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/710426/answer","Biography information for Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/710426/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/710426/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2017-03-13","Housing: Construction","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of how all future housing, including low cost housing, can be designed to be aesthetically attractive, sensitive to the character of where it is situated and free from easy stigmatisation as the homes of the socially less affluent; and what action they are taking in this regard.","false","Biography information for Lord Judd",,"Lord Judd","HL6030"

In the UK, the UK Council for Child Internet Safety brings together parents, charities, industry and government to respond to issues of online safety, including child sexual abuse. In 2015, the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) published a practical guide for providers of social media and interactive services.</p><p>The guide has examples of good practice from leading technology companies (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube), and advice from NGOs and other online child safety experts. Its purpose is to encourage businesses to think about “safety by design” to help make their platforms safer for children and young people under 18. That guidance covers the steps to identify and deal with child sexual abuse content or illegal sexual contact. A number of social media companies are also members of the EU ICT Coalition. This is a European industry initiative to make members’ platforms safer for users. Members self-declare how they meet the guiding principles, and are subject to a review by an external auditor. These principles include child abuse and/or illegal contact.</p>","Truro and Falmouth","Sarah Newton",,"2017-03-15T16:02:23.363Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/709642/answer","Biography information for Sarah Newton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/709642/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/709642/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2017-03-09","Social Media: Offences against Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if she will bring forward legislative proposals to require operators of social media platforms to report communications sent via their service which are either indecent images or videos of children or messages which would lead to the sexual grooming of a child to a relevant police force.","false","Biography information for Anna Turley","Redcar","Anna Turley","67216"

Where such material indicates there is an imminent threat to UK national security, they should report that content to our law enforcement or security and intelligence agencies. Ministers and officials continually raise these issues with social media platforms who are based abroad.</p><p>The UK Government is already doing what it can to identify and disrupt terrorist and extremist abuse of the internet. Since 2010, the police Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) has worked with industry to secure the removal of over 250,000 pieces of terrorist content. Industry cooperation with CTIRU has significantly improved leading to faster and more consistent removal of referred content. CTIRU have established relationships with over 300 Communication Service Providers of differing sizes and removals at the request of CTIRU have increased from around 60 items a month in 2010, when CTIRU was first established, to on average of over 8000 a month in 2016. These arrangements mean that where companies take action this removes access to terrorist and extremist content from the whole platform, not just for users accessing it from within a particular jurisdiction, and therefore has a world-wide benefit.</p><p>However, although industry have taken some positive steps to address this issue, the internet is still being used to recruit, radicalise, incite and inspire and Governments cannot tackle this alone.
