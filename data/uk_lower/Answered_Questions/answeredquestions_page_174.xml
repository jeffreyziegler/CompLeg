Work done by the Government Actuary’s Department has concluded that the NHSPS remains good value and the “scheme pays” facility offers an efficient mechanism for meeting any tax liabilities.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The annual and lifetime allowances are important fiscal measures to ensure income tax relief on pension contributions is fair and sustainable. In context of the 1995 final salary section of the NHS Pension Scheme, clinicians who use up the full £40,000 annual allowance would see their annual pension increase by around £2,500. Clinicians who reach the £1 million lifetime allowance limit can expect an annual pension of around £44,000 payable at age 60 and increasing with inflation, plus a tax free lump sum of £132,000. Pensions of this size provide substantial financial security in retirement.</p><p> </p><p>Note:</p><p> </p><p><sup>1</sup>This work considered the length of time a member subject to the annual allowance would need to receive pension in retirement to recover both their own contributions to the NHSPS and the annual allowance tax charge for the year in question.
