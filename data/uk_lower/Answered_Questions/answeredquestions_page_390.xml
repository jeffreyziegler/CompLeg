Average time in cell is measured per weekday and this information is provided by individual prison establishment, by prison category and across the prison estate.

It should be noted that time in cell includes time when prisoners are asleep. Time unlocked includes time where a prisoner is either out of their cell or where the cell door is unlocked allowing them to move freely in and out of the cell.</p><br /><p>Tables 3 and 4 show the

It was £20,300 from 2013/14, £20,500 in 2014/15 and £20,800 in 2015/16. Additionally, for a Certificate of Sponsorship to be allocated, the employer (the sponsor) must be paying the appropriate salary rate for the occupation in question. These rates are set out in Appendix J of the Immigration Rules: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-j-codes-of-practice-for-skilled-work.</p><p>Restricted Certificates of Sponsorship are subject to an annual limit and are allocated to sponsoring employers each month. The limit was undersubscribed until June 2015 and so all valid applications for Restricted Certificates of Sponsorship were granted, where the salary was at least equal to the minimum thresholds above.</p><p>If the limit is oversubscribed, as it has been since June, applications for Restricted Certificates of Sponsorship are prioritised using a points table. Points are awarded for shortage occupations, PhD-level occupations, and salary.

We welcome the work of the highly effective UN Special Rapporteur on Burma, who has shone a spotlight on violations against the Rohingya in Rakhine. She has not characterised the treatment of the Rohingya as genocide, and neither did the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide in his 4 November statement on Burma’s elections. However, any judgement on whether genocide has occurred is a matter for international judicial decision, rather than for governments or non-judicial bodies. A UN investigation would require high level international support for which, we assess, there is little prospect of agreement at this stage. Our approach is to seek an end to all violations, irrespective of whether or not they fit the definition of specific international crimes. I and other British Government Ministers take every appropriate opportunity, both publicly and in private, to press the Burmese authorities to take urgent steps to address the situation of the Rohingya. I did this with senior Burmese Ministers during my visit to Burma in July, when I travelled to Rakhine State for the second time. Most recently, I raised the issue with the Burmese Foreign Minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, in September in New York. After the 8 November elections, the UK will continue our efforts to address the serious ongoing human rights violations against the Rohingya in Rakhine State.</p>","East Devon","Mr Hugo Swire",,"2015-11-12T17:40:32.237Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426119/answer","Biography information for Sir Hugo Swire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426119/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426119/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2015-11-04","Burma: Rohingya","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, if he will support the establishment of a full, international, independent investigation by the UN into claims of genocide against the Rohingya in Burma.","false","Biography information for Mr David Burrowes","Enfield, Southgate","Mr David Burrowes","14857"

All water and sewerage companies have to remove and treat the rainwater that drains into public sewers, so a surface water drainage charge is included in all customers’ bills. Some companies average these costs across all their customers, while others charge their non-household customers according to the amount of water that drains from their property into the sewer. This is known as site area charging; its aim is to ensure that charges reflect the actual costs associated with providing a drainage service to that customer.</p><p>This approach to charging results in reductions to the bills of some customers.

Steps have been taken at each of the prisons inspected during 2014-15 to address the specific recommendations made, and detailed action plans put in place. We are also seeking to address the Chief Inspector’s comments on each of the four outcomes of safety, respect, purposeful activity and resettlement, and we are tackling the risks of increased violence highlighted by the Chief Inspector.</p><p>The National Offender Management Service is committed to running safe prisons. We are holding a more violent prison population; the number of people sentenced to prison for violent offences has increased by 30% in the last 10 years. In addition the illicit use of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) has been a significant factor in fuelling violence in prisons. This Government has introduced two new offences through the Serious Crime Act 2015 for being in possession of a knife or other offensive weapon within a prison without authorisation, and throwing of items, including NPS over a prison wall without authorisation. This offence will help to control these substances in prison. We are also introducing an offence of possession of NPS in the prison estate.</p><p>NOMS also operates a violence reduction project to gain a better understanding of the causes of the current levels of violence in prisons and to ensure that there is strengthened handling of it, in terms of both prevention and response. A joint national protocol between the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), the CPS, and ACPO was published in February 2015 with the purpose of ensuring a nationally consistent approach to the referral and prosecution of crimes in prison.</p><p>The Chief Inspector of Prisons found that “respect” (how a prisoner is treated) held up best amongst their four areas of inspection. We are continuing to take forward the strengths he highlighted which included: good staff/prisoner relationships, increased use of prisoner peer mentors and good practice in health care.</p><p>We noted the Chief Inspector’s concerns about “purposeful activity”. We want prisons to be places of hard work, rigorous education and high ambition, with incentives for prisoners to learn and for prison staff to prioritise education and work. The hours worked by prisoners in industrial occupations has already risen from 10.6 million hours in 2010/2011 to 14.2 million hours in the 2013-2014.</p><p>Finally in relation to resettlement (preparing prisoners for their release into the community) we have put in place an unprecedented nationwide ‘through the prison gate’ resettlement service, meaning most offenders are given continuous support by one provider from custody into the community. Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) launched their ‘Through the Gate’ service on 1 May 2015. This service provides offenders with support to find accommodation and jobs, finance and debt advice, and support for sex workers and victims of domestic violence.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2015-11-09T17:26:36.933Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426267/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426267/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/426267/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2015-11-04","Prisons","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what measures the Government plans to take to address the concerns expressed by the Chief Inspector of Prisons in his Annual Report for 2014-15, published on 15 July 2015; and what those measures will be on each of the four assessed outcomes referred to in the introduction to that report.","false","Biography information for Mr Douglas Carswell","Clacton","Mr Douglas Carswell","14701"
