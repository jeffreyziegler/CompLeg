Building an effective intelligence picture and understanding is essential to combat both opportunistic individuals and Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) who would seek to circumvent UK border controls. Border Force has established a Maritime Information Bureau, attached to the National Maritime Information Centre to coordinate all maritime intelligence flows respectively and to inform multi-agency operational responses aimed at securing the UK border. This is supported by public facing intelligence work under the banner of Project Kraken. Kraken has helped raise awareness in local communities to the threats within maritime draw stakeholders together via an engagement strategy, and develop a more effective methodology for intelligence sharing; ensuring assets and resource can be deployed to deliver greatest effect.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Border Force has purchased new capability, in the form of coastal patrol vessels (CPV). These new boats complement the work being done by Border Force’s cutter fleet and are being introduced in a phased approach over two years.

The CPVs’ unique capabilities, speed and size, will allow them to provide an enhanced level of responsiveness in cross-Channel, Channel Islands and Estuarine areas; releasing the cutters to complete longer-range operations around the coast. The purchase of this additional capability forms part of Border Force’s long term strategic planning which will enable it to support operations in the maritime sector.

The Government has given the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) a new remit to work with industry on cost reduction and delivery capability for decommissioning.

As yet the Department has not undertaken a review of regulation 5. Any such review would be completed with input from the CQC.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC has advised that it is the provider’s responsibility to ensure that all directors appointed are fit and proper for their role. The CQC’s responsibility is to check whether providers have the right systems and processes in place to assure themselves of fitness.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC has not yet conducted a thorough assessment of the regulations’ effectiveness. However, in the first years of implementation, the CQC has received feedback on how the regulation is applied, often driven by an assumption that it is CQC’s role to assess fitness directly rather than to assess providers’ systems and processes.</p><p> </p><p>In response to this feedback, the CQC has considered whether its current approach is in line with what can be reasonably expected of the CQC within the current regulations. The CQC has therefore begun a programme of work to improve its internal systems and processes for handling referrals under FPPR. There are three areas of CQC’s guidance and processes that it is strengthening:</p><p> </p><p>- Passing on all details of FPPR concerns raised with the CQC to providers</p><p>Presently the CQC does not pass on all concerns raised with it to providers to ask for an explanation. Instead the CQC assesses whether there are concerns that a reasonable employer should be expected to investigate and if the CQC does not think there is a substantive concern it does not pass the material on. When the CQC does share concerns, it initially summarises the information and will later send on the full material if requested.</p><p> </p><p>CQC’s intention is to change both of these steps so providers are notified of all concerns and receive all of the information immediately. The CQC will set out more clearly the type of investigation it expects providers to undertake, following notification.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Interpretation of “serious mismanagement”</p><p> </p><p>CQC believes there would be benefit in developing a clearer understanding of what type of behaviour constitutes ‘serious management’. The CQC has prepared some draft guidance that characterises serious mismanagement and will shortly be publishing this for consultation. The CQC will develop the finalised draft into internal and external guidance as to how it interprets and applies this element of the regulation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The way CQC manages and records information regarding FPPR</p><p> </p><p>It is recognised internally that CQC needs to improve the data available to itself about CQC’s application of FPPR.
