This is primarily through an independent bi-annual âSize and Healthâ survey of the UK industrial sector which assesses the growth of the UK space economy. The Agency also monitors contracts that flow back to UK industry from Agency-targeted subscriptions to the European Space Agency as well as monitoring where Agency-supported research and development work has positioned UK industry for success in future operational contracts. More recently the Agency has extended its role in actively supporting and promoting UK industrial exports of both satellite and emerging space-related data services.</p><p>All objective measures from these activities point to a growing success story for our space industry. Indeed it is one of our economy's fastest growing sectors, with an average growth rate of almost 7.5%, and it has ambitions to increase its annual turnover to Â£40 billion by 2030.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61019","Department for Energy and Climate Change","false","2014-06-17","<p>The Government wants to encourage all householders to invest in energy efficiency, whether rural or urban. The Green Deal Home Improvement Fund is designed to incentivise householders in England and Wales to install a wide range of energy efficiency measures, such as insulation and better glazing. Many rural properties have solid walls, making them well placed to take maximum advantage of the scheme - such households could be eligible to receive up to Â£6000 for installing solid wall insulation, or up to Â£7000 for installing solid wall insulation and two other eligible measures.</p><p>However DECC does consider it appropriate to exclude oil and LPG fired boilers from the GDHIF scheme. The Government fully recognises that LPG and oil, like other fossil fuels, will continue to play a part in the UK's energy mix, but we must begin to revolutionise the way we heat our homes to make the transition to a low carbon economy. To this end, DECC has introduced the domestic renewable heat incentive (RHI) scheme to support renewable heating systems; this support aims to compensate householders for the additional costs they face when installing a renewable heating system compared to an oil heating system. The domestic RHI is targeted at, but not limited to, homes off the gas grid. Incentivising oil and LPG boilers in this context would undermine the balance struck in the design of the RHI, and potentially cause confusion for consumers. For low income and vulnerable customers, support is available through the Affordable Warmth element of the Energy Company Obligation. Through this, energy suppliers deliver heating cost reductions in eligible off gas and on gas grid households through the provision of any measures which will reduce costs. We have proposed changes to ECO which will actively incentivise suppliers to deliver measures to non-gas fuelled households.</p><p> </p>","Bexhill and Battle","Gregory Barker",,"2014-06-17T16:01:04.620536Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61019/answer","Biography information for Lord Barker of Battle","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61019/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61019/answer",,,,,,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2014-06-10","Fuel Oil: Rural Areas","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, what recent assessment he has made of the effect of the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund on people who live in rural areas and rely on oil fired central heating.","false","Biography information for Guto Bebb","Aberconwy","Guto Bebb","200086"

This is reviewed on an annual basis or where there are in-year changes of at least a 25 per cent change in the level of income. This simplified approach provides parents with greater certainty over the level of maintenance payable.

Government has taken significant steps to ensure the continued authenticity of our food including increasing support to Local Authorities for delivery of the national coordinated sampling programme from Â£1.6m to Â£2.2m in 2013/14. Continued investment in the Government's food authenticity research programme ensures that the UK is at the cutting edge of science in developing novel technologies to detect ever more sophisticated food fraud and protect UK consumers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In June 2013 the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for Health asked Professor Elliot to conduct a review into the Integrity and Assurance of Food Supply Networks. The interim report was published on 12 December 2013 and the Professor's final report will be published shortly.</p><p> </p><br /><p>[1]<a href="http://food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/horsemeat-attitudesb.pdf" target="_blank">http://food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/horsemeat-attitudesb.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p>[2]<a href="http://www.which.co.uk/news/2013/03/horsemeat-scandal-dents-trust-in-food-industry-313016/" target="_blank">http://www.which.co.uk/news/2013/03/horsemeat-scandal-dents-trust-in-food-industry-313016/</a></p><p> </p><p>[3]<a href="http://shoppervista.igd.com/Hub.aspx?id=4&amp;tid=4" target="_blank">http://shoppervista.igd.com/Hub.aspx?id=4&amp;tid=4</a></p><p> </p><p>[4]<a href="http://store.mintel.com/consumer-trust-in-food-uk-june-2013?cookie_test=true" target="_blank">http://store.mintel.com/consumer-trust-in-food-uk-june-2013?cookie_test=true#</a></p><p> </p><p>[5]<a href="http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/topics/food-safety/horse-meat/horsegate-scandal-hasnt-changed-shopping-habits-of-majority/353432.article" target="_blank">http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/topics/food-safety/horse-meat/horsegate-scandal-hasnt-changed-shopping-habits-of-majority/353432.article</a></p><p> </p><p> </p>","Camborne and Redruth","George Eustice",,"2014-06-17T14:53:42.1533043Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61162/answer","Biography information for George Eustice","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61162/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61162/answer",,,,,,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2014-06-10","Food: Public Opinion","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment he has made of public trust in the authenticity of food purchased at food outlets in each (a) region and (b) local authority area since January 2013.","false","Biography information for Jim Fitzpatrick","Poplar and Limehouse","Jim Fitzpatrick","200060"

Fundamentally, council tax is not a wealth tax; it is a local charge for the use of local services. The current banded system is intentionally designed to avoid the flaws and inequities of both the poll tax and of domestic rates, the former which taxed multiple-adult homes too much, and the latter which taxed both family homes and pensioner households too much.</p><p> </p><p>I would note that the last Labour Government and Welsh Assembly Government jointly undertook a council tax revaluation and re-banding exercise in Wales in 2005. Four times as many homes moved up one or more bands than moved down. Two-thirds of the net rises were amongst homes (originally) in Bands A to C, meaning that those on more modest incomes were hardest hit.</p><p> </p><p>Labour Ministers originally claimed that revaluation was revenue-neutral, but this was not the case. In the first year of the revaluation, council tax income rose by 10 per cent, of which 4 per cent was due to that year's increase in Band D rates, and 6 per cent due to more properties in higher bands due to the revaluation (Welsh Assembly Government, <em>Submission to the Lyons Inquiry into Local Government, Annex B: Council Tax Revaluation and Rebanding 2005 Chronology and Facts</em>, March 2006). To place that in context, a 6 per cent rise in council tax receipts in England would today represent a sustained tax increase on hard-working people of Â£1.4 billion a year, every year.</p><p> </p><p>As the then Chairman of the Communities and Local Government Select Committee, Phyllis Starkey (then the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South West), observed: âThe Welsh Assembly â I believe it was my party, but I am not making an excuse for it â took advantage of the revaluation hugely to increase the total [tax] takeâ (3 February 2010, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 383).</p><p> </p><p>Instead of finding new ways to tax people, this Government has given extra funding to town halls to help freeze council tax. We cancelled any plans for a council tax revaluation. We have handed local residents new rights to veto big local tax hikes, so local people have the final say on the amount they pay. Council tax in England more than doubled under the Labour Government; under this Government, bills have fallen by 11 per cent in real terms, giving families financial security and helping hard-working people with the cost of living.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis",,"2014-06-19T16:28:32.5337265Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61168/answer","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61168/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61168/answer",,,,,,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-06-10","Council Tax","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what assessment he has made of the revenue that would be generated from additional council tax bands on higher value homes, broken down by (a) the total revenue generated UK wide, (b) the total generated in the Greater London region and (c) a breakdown for each threshold and band value (i) UK wide and (ii) in the Greater London region.","false","Biography information for Baroness Jowell","Dulwich and West Norwood","Dame Tessa Jowell","199982"
