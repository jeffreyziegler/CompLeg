Evidence suggests that increased cycling could create significant savings for the NHS, less pollution and congestion, and a happier and healthier population. It is likely that a licensing system will discourage many existing and potential cyclists, leading to a dramatic fall in the numbers of people cycling.</p><br /><p>Around 80% of adult cyclists also hold driving licenses, meaning that the majority of cyclists on the road have already been tested on operating safely in different road and traffic conditions. Furthermore, the safety case for a testing/licensing system is not as strong as that for drivers since, by contrast with motorised vehicles, bicycles involved in collisions on the highway are highly unlikely to cause serious injury to other road users.</p><br /><p>Cyclists as well as all road users must obey the Highway Code, and the Government has provided funding for training schemes such as Bikeability which provides practical training and teaches the Highway Code to the next generation of cyclists.

That is why, through the National Cyber Security Programme, we have invested over Â£90 million over the last five years to bolster the law enforcement response, and we will continue to invest. As the Chancellor announced on 17 November, we plan to almost double investment in cyber security, including cyber crime, to Â£1.9 billion over the next five years.</p><p>Cyber Crime, including internet enabled fraud will continue to call for a multi layered response from Government, Law Enforcement and Industry to successfully tackle the threat. At the National and International level the National Cyber Crime Unit in the National Crime Agency (NCA) will continue to lead operations to disrupt serious cyber crime at scale. This includes joint operations with industry and international law enforcement partners across the globe, to disrupt cyber criminals, attack their infrastructure and protect UK businesses and citizens.</p><p>Having an accurate national picture of the threat is critical to informing our ongoing response. That is why there has been and will continue to be significant investment in Action Fraud and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, which has seen the reporting of fraud and cyber crime trebled, from 72,000 before the centralisation of reporting to over 230,000 reports. As a result of this improvement in reporting we have now got a much improved intelligence picture.</p><p>Industry also has a central role in fraud and Cyber Crime prevention. That is why we are working with the banking sector and law enforcement agencies to more effectively disrupt fraudsters and protect victims. The Government also continues to raise awareness of cyber crime and fraud at all levels, through the Cyber Streetwise campaign, while providing advice to help individuals and small businesses adopt safer behaviours online and to be better protected. The third phase, launched in September this year focuses on promoting the adoption of three simple online behaviours: use of three random words to create a strong password; install security software on all devices; and always download the latest software and app updates as soon as they appear.</p><p>The UK also leads international efforts to raise global cyber resilience through our work with the National Crime Agency (NCA) and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and others, to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the threat from Cyber Crime. In the past three years the NCA has used Government funding to increase the investigative capacity of a range of Law Enforcement partners around the World. The projects, which range from 'on-the-job' investigative mentoring to legislative and technical training in the UK, focus on supporting the NCA's priority countries overseas and build capability and mutually beneficial relationships with key partners across the globe.</p>",,"Lord Bates",,"2015-11-30T12:17:16.17Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431528/answer","Biography information for Lord Bates","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431528/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431528/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2015-11-23","Cybercrime","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majestyâs Government whether they will seek to improve the effectiveness of national and global measures to counter internet fraud and other online crime.","false","Biography information for Lord Birt",,"Lord Birt","HL3791"

In addition, the implementation of measures in the Small Business and Employment Act 2015 will require the largest banks to refer customers who have been declined finance to alternative providers via designated platforms.</p><p>The report also highlights that finding customers remains a problem for SMEs but that this is relatively less problematic than in previous years. We are supporting SMEs by providing advice on a range of issues through Growth Hubs, which join up local resources; the My Business Support Tool which helps businesses find the support they need quickly; and the Business Support Helpline.</p><br /><p>Government has made public contract opportunities easier to find by making them all accessible on an improved single online portal. The Contracts Finder contains current public sector contracts (above Â£10,000 in Central Government and Â£25,000 in the wider public sector) and a forwardpipelineof potential contract opportunities up to 2020.</p><br /><p>Of the 50,000 plus businesses that make up the customer base of UK Trade &amp; Investment, some 90% are SMEs.</p><br /><p>UKTI provides tailored help for SMEs, including: working out which markets suit their business; identifying export opportunities; introducing them to key contacts and setting up business meetings; and helping firms exhibit their goods and services at trade fairs.</p><br />",,"Baroness Neville-Rolfe",,"2015-12-10T16:56:25.66Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431562/answer","Biography information for Baroness Neville-Rolfe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431562/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431562/answer",,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2015-11-23","Small Businesses","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majestyâs Government what action they are taking in response to data published by the European Commission in its 2015 Annual Report on European SMEs, which found that access to finance and finding customers are some of the greatest issues faced by SMEs in the EU.","false","Biography information for Lord Cotter",,"Lord Cotter","HL3825"

For example, the Cyber Essentials scheme sets out the basic technical controls organisations should have in place to protect against common cyber attacks. As the Chancellor also announced on 17 November, spending on the UKâs cyber security programmes will be almost doubled over the next five years, with Â£1.9 billion funding. Although Government is making a significant investment, partnership between the public and private sector is crucial to making the UK one of the safest places to do business online. By identifying and closing down vulnerabilities in their systems and processes, the private sector can make it much more difficult for criminals to operate. That is why we are working closely with the private sector to drive up standards. In the coming months we will also publish, in collaboration with industry, information to help the public better understand key cyber security principles of devices to help them to make more informed decisions. This work will be a part of the Governmentâs Modern Crime Prevention Strategy, which I intend to Publish next year.</p><p>At the same time, through our Cyber Streetwise campaign, we are helping to inform the public of simple security measures, such as installing security software, which in themselves can protect them and their devices against fraud.</p>","Hemel Hempstead","Mike Penning",,"2015-12-01T16:46:37.503Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431621/answer","Biography information for Sir Mike Penning","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431621/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431621/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2015-11-23","Mobile Phones: Security","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if she will take steps to improve the security of mobile devices that are used to access internet banking.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","17232"

It is worth noting that planning areas are set by local authorities, and can change from year to year.</p><br /><p>Every free school has been opened in response to either the need to provide extra school places, the need to provide parents with greater choice or the need to provide more high quality school places. 83% of free schools approved since January 2014 are in areas where there was a recognised need for additional school places. 74% of open mainstream free schools are in areas where there was a need for additional school places. There are currently 104 mainstream free schools in the pipeline, of which 64 are primary or all-through schools.</p><br /><p>Many local authorities are recognising the opportunity that the free schools programme provides and are encouraging new and existing high quality education providers to apply to set up a new school in their area. We encourage all local authorities to do likewise.</p><br /><p>The department does not currently publish basic need scorecards for secondary school places.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431657","Department for Education","false","2015-12-01","<p>Our vision for children with Special Educational Needs and disabilities (SEND) is the same as for all children and young people â that they thrive in their early years, at school and in college, and lead happy and fulfilled lives. We have made extensive changes to the SEND system to improve prospects for these students.</p><br /><p>The Children and Families Act 2014 secures the general presumption in law of mainstream education in relation to decisions about where children and young people with SEN should be educated and the Equality Act 2010 provides protection from discrimination for disabled people. The presumption of mainstream education is supported by provisions which safeguard the interests of all children and young people and ensure that the school preferences of the young person or their parents are met wherever possible.</p><br /><p>Local authorities must review the educational provision for children and young people with SEN and disabilities in their areas and whether this meets the needs of those concerned. The Department produces national projections for the number of pupils in England, which help inform local authority decision-making over school capacity. Local authorities have the freedom to choose to use some of their capital funding on new places in special schools where that is a local priority and we continue to welcome applications for new special free schools where there is a particular need or demand for new provision.</p><br /><p>The proportion of pupils with a statement of SEN or Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan has remained at 2.8% since 2007. There are 236,165 children with statements or EHC plans. Of those children with statements, 57% were in mainstream places in state-funded schools in January 2015. The proportion in special schools was 43% in January 2015.</p><br /><p>The educational attainment of pupils with SEND has generally been improving, but a significant gap remains between their attainment and that of those with no identified SEND. At Key Stage 2 for example, in National Curriculum assessments in 2014 38% of all pupils with SEN achieved the expected level in the combined reading, writing and mathematics measure in 2014, compared with 90% of pupils with no identified SEN, resulting in an attainment gap of 51 percentage points. This represented an improvement of 2 percentage points since 2013 (when the equivalent figures were 34% of pupils with SEN and 88% of those with no identified SEN).

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431700","Department of Health","false","2015-12-01","<p>The current legal framework allows a clinician to prescribe drugs outside their licensed indication where that will best meet the clinical needs of their patient. This clinical freedom is crucial in delivering appropriate healthcare to groups of patients for whom medicines have not historically been licensed, e.g. children. It is also helpful in enabling prescribers to quickly pick up and apply new evidence that will help patients with particular clinical needs. The Off-Patent Drugs Bill would introduce a legal duty to apply for a licence for off-patent drugs where evidence of effectiveness for a new indication becomes available. This will create an expectation that only licensed uses of drugs are acceptable and therefore that off-label use is not appropriate. This would cause unnecessary delays in patients getting the medicines they need by slowing the rapid uptake of new evidence in clinical practice.
