However, that announcement said: ‘<em>...work will also be undertaken to determine information about the extent of caste discrimination in Britain that can be used as a comparative baseline for any future consideration of the effectiveness of caste legislation.'</em></p><p>We had intended to reflect consideration of this work in the public consultation process. However, further discussions between Government and the EHRC about the research needed for it have revealed concerns that not only might this be difficult to commission successfully, but it could be seen as intrusive and might have an adverse effect on good relations in the relevant communities. We are therefore considering how best to proceed with the consultation in the light of this.</p><p>Another recent development is the judgment in the Employment Tribunal case of <em>Tirkey v Chandok</em> which concluded that there is already legal protection against caste discrimination through the race provisions of the Equality Act 2010.

Member to Live Table 773 available on my Department's website at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/286822/Table_773.xlsx" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/286822/Table_773.xlsx</a> for data on homelessness acceptances and households with a priority need category of domestic violence.</p><p>Data at local authority level can be found in our “Detailed local authority level homelessness figures” spreadsheets which can be found on my Department's website at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-homelessness" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-homelessness</a></p><p>The average numbers since 2010 are far less than under the last Administration, but there is no case for complacency or tolerance of domestic violence.The Coalition Government has ring-fenced nearly £40 million of stable funding for specialist local domestic and sexual violence support services until 2015. This funding is used to part-fund 54 Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference coordinators and 144 Independent Domestic Violence Advisors. We have piloted and rolled out Clare's Law and Domestic Violence Protection Orders; extended the definition of domestic abuse to cover controlling behaviour and teenage relationships; run two successful campaigns to challenge perceptions of abuse; and placed Domestic Homicide Reviews on a statutory footing to make sure lessons are learned from individual tragedies.</p><p>The dynamics of domestic abuse mean that accommodation can play an important role in the resolution of interpersonal abuse and conflict. It is the foundation to ensuring that adult and child victims are afforded safety and security. This is why this Government has invested £470 million to prevent and tackle all forms of homelessness over the spending review period. The homelessness legislation in England provides one of the strongest safety nets in the world for families with children and vulnerable people who become homeless through no fault of their own.</p><p>There is a range of support for victims of domestic abuse. Some victims will be accommodated in refuges, but Sanctuary Schemes and mainstream local authority accommodation may be an option for others, while some victims will pursue independent solutions with help and advice from support schemes as necessary.</p><p>My Department also funds UKRefugesOnline a UK wide database of domestic violence services which supports the national 24 hour free phone domestic violence helpline. It enables those working with victims of domestic violence to identify appropriate services and potential refuge vacancies around the country so that victims can get the help they need as quickly as possible.</p><p>This Government has also made common sense changes to the law to allow local authorities to end the main homelessness duty with offers of accommodation in good-quality private sector accommodation. This helps homeless households move to settled accommodation more quickly and means they spend less time in temporary accommodation. Indeed, we have reduced the average stay in temporary accommodation from 20 months at the beginning of 2010 to 14 months now.</p><p> </p>","Keighley","Kris Hopkins",,"2014-05-14T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46048/answer","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46048/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46048/answer","Keighley","Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46048/answer/previousversion/4496","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-03-31","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, how many homeless households were accepted as being owed a duty of accommodation by their local authority in each year since 2010; and how many such acceptances were the result of domestic violence.","false","Biography information for Helen Jones","Warrington North","Helen Jones","194443"

The purpose of any placement in open conditions is for such prisoners' risks to be tested in less stringent conditions in order to inform the Parole Board's consideration as to whether it is safe to release them into the community. It is also is an important part of the offender's rehabilitation. The decision to transfer ISPs to open conditions is a categorisation decision which is a matter for the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may take this decision after seeking advice from the Parole Board or executively where the prisoners may demonstrate exceptional progress.</p><p> </p><p>However, there is nothing automatic about progress from open conditions to eventual release. Rather, the period in open prison will serve as an important time to test the prisoner and will help inform the Parole Board's decision whether the offenders risk is such that it may be safely managed in the community.</p><p> </p><p>For many prisoners, in particular those such as ISPs who have spent a considerable amount of time in custody; these are essential components for successful reintegration in the community and therefore an important factor in protecting the public. To release these prisoners directly from a closed prison without the resettlement benefits of the open estate would undoubtedly lead to higher levels of post-release re-offending.</p><p> </p><p>The main purpose of open conditions is to test prisoners in conditions more similar to those that they will face in the community. It also enables them to develop their plans for eventual release. Time spent in open prisons affords prisoners the opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties, reintegrate into the community and ensure housing needs are met. Open prisons are the most effective means of ensuring that prisoners are subject to testing, with appropriate risk assessment to ensure the protection of the public, before they are released into the community. Once tariff has expired, an ISP's continued detention is justified only so long as it is necessary for the protection of the public.</p><p> </p><p>Public protection is the priority and the Board will take into account a range of factors when assessing whether an offender's risk is reduced sufficiently, in order that they can be managed in open conditions or on licence in the community. These might include the completion of offence related courses, a sustained period of good custodial behaviour, access to appropriate and stable accommodation, access to education, training and employment, and support from professionals as well as family and friends. The Parole Board would not recommend a prisoner's transfer to open conditions unless they considered it safe to do so.

Together they will provide a clear legislative framework that will support local authorities to consider the needs of the whole family, deliver coordinated packages of support and protect children and young people from excessive or inappropriate caring roles.</p><p>In addition, we will develop regulations and statutory guidance that will build on existing best practice to support local implementation. We plan to issue draft versions for consultation in spring 2014 and final versions in October 2014; six months before the changes will take effect.

The UK is a strong supporter of European Union Force (EUFOR) Operation Althea's maintenance of the safe and secure environment in BiH, and is proud of its contributions in theatre, and through a reserve company, 1 Scots. Our support for BiH's policing has led to our contributing to establishing a trilateral Police Cooperation Centre (PCC) in Trebinje, resulting in more efficient and effective actions being taken between law enforcement agencies in the region. UK Ministers and officials have made clear to BiH's leaders their responsibility for ensuring that their public rhetoric is not inflammatory or ethnically divisive. <br><br>Following the recent protests, we have made clear to BiH's leaders that they need to respond to the population's legitimate desire for change, most recently when the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my Rt. Hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), met the BiH Presidency and Foreign Minister on 27 March. During his recent visit the Foreign Secretary met representatives of civil society and plenums and expressed our support to widen the political space in BiH so as to allow citizens to hold politicians to account. <br><br>Part of our work to widen the political space is the recent British BiH Fellowship Programme. A one-month residential programme in the UK designed to equip BiH's future leaders with the skills and experience to lead positive change in their country. <br><br>The Foreign Secretary also announced continuing UK assistance for BiH's path towards EU membership, in the form of new funding to foster democratic governance in Bosnia by strengthening the judiciary, civil society organisations, governance and supporting BiH's EU accession process. Specific examples include political and financial support focused on strengthening the State Court and State Prosecutor's Office, which will improve the operation of Rule of Law systems in BiH. <br><br>In addition, the UK supports the activities of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), whose work in BiH has focused on equipping local non-governmental organisations with the skills they need to provide effective evidence for parliamentary committees. WFD has done valuable work with BiH's Parliament to raise awareness of the value of such committees. This has influenced positively the formation of legislation, and opened up the process of law-making to public scrutiny, while promoting citizen participation in the democratic process.</p>",,"Baroness Warsi",,"2014-04-23T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/45774/answer","Biography information for Baroness Warsi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/45774/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/45774/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2014-03-27","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what current plans they have to enhance stability and democracy in Bosnia Herzegovina.","false","Biography information for The Earl of Dundee",,"The Earl of Dundee","HL6423"

At the same time the annual Junior ISA and Child Trust Fund subscription limits will be increased to £4,000.</p><p> </p><p>These measures were part of a wider Budget packaged aimed at supporting savers.

This was developed in collaboration with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Local Government Association and the Trading Standards Institute. The guidance covers offences head shops may be committing under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985, and various consumer protection regulations.<br><br>The Home Office also provides local authorities and their trading standards officers with technical and financial support with drug testing through the Forensic Early Warning System. This supports local authorities in their action against the sale of legal highs by helping them to identify the contents of legal high products. To date, we have brought well over 250 substances under control through the use of ‘generic' legislation and temporary class drug orders. We also work closely with law enforcement to tackle this reckless trade. Concerted action, started in November 2013, has so far resulted in over 40 arrests and seizures of new psychoactive substances, including 9 kilograms by Kent Police. <br><br>Last summer we also ran a targeted communications campaign to raise awareness of the risks in taking new psychoactive substances amongst young people; providing information on these substances through our FRANK online service. <br><br>However, we accept that more can be done, hence my announcement on 12 December 2013 of a review by an expert panel to look at how the UK's response to new psychoactive substances can be enhanced beyond the existing measures.

This is the biggest step towards fairer schools funding in a decade, and it puts us in a much better position to implement a national funding formula when the time is right.</p><p>To allocate this £350 million as fairly as possible, we selected the characteristics we think contribute most to the attainment of pupils and viability of schools, and set indicative minimum funding levels for each of these. These characteristics include deprivation and low prior attainment, both of which show some correlation with low-cost, high incidence special educational needs (SEN). We looked at the average value attached by local authorities to these characteristics and used these as a basis for our proposed minimum funding levels. Applying these minimum funding levels could mean that some of the least fairly funded local authorities with high numbers of these pupils see a benefit.</p><p>This additional £350 million applies to the schools block of the dedicated schools grant that local authorities receive. However, this is one of three notional blocks of funding, and local authorities are free to move money between their schools block, high needs block and early years block as they see fit. It is therefore possible that local authorities could choose to move the additional money to their high needs block to support children with high-cost special educational needs.</p><p>Our proposals are still at the consultation stage.
