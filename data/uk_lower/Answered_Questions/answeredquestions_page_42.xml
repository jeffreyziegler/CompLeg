The snapshot is taken annually by local authorities using street counts, evidence-based estimates, and estimates informed by spotlight street counts. Local authorities decide, in conjunction with their local partners and based on advice from Homeless Link who verify the rough sleeping statistics collection, to use the approach that they believe will return the most accurate figure to assess the extent of people sleeping rough in their local area.</p><p>The methodology used has been in place since 2010 when it was developed after consultation with local authorities and the voluntary sector with the objective of strengthening the accuracy of the figures. Prior to 2010, there was no requirement for all local authorities to carry out a count or estimate to make an assessment of the number of people sleeping rough in their local area.</p><p>We are confident in the annual rough sleeping statistics and the methodology used. The annual snapshot has never claimed to be a total figure of all those sleeping rough in the country and is a pragmatic approach that provides a representation of those sleeping rough, alongside a reliable and consistent measure of change. The methodology used in England aligns with the approach which is now standard in many parts of the world including Canada, the United States and a number of other European countries.</p><p>All counts and estimates are independently verified by Homeless Link. Homeless Link oversee the whole process, issue clear guidance on how to conduct a count or estimate and actively challenge areas to ensure figures are reliable. Hundreds of local partners and voluntary sector organisations actively engage in the count and producing the estimate which also gives us confidence in the reliability of the statistics.</p><p>Accurately counting or estimating the number of people sleeping rough within a local authority is inherently difficult given the hidden nature of rough sleeping. There are a range of factors that can have an impact on the number of people seen or thought to be sleeping rough on any given night. This includes the weather, where people choose to sleep, the date and time chosen, and the availability of alternatives such as night shelters.</p><p>MHCLG is actively encouraging local authorities with significant numbers of rough sleepers to improve their year-round data on rough sleeping and is working collaboratively with local authorities to develop improved homelessness data and outcomes that can measure progress in reducing rough sleeping and homelessness.</p><p>Alongside our recent overhaul of homelessness statistics, through H-CLIC, to collect detailed case level information about every homelessness application we are also establishing local data pilots which will seek to improve the data collected by a wide range of services which people who sleep rough access</p><p><br>The Government is committed to reducing homelessness and ending rough sleeping. No one should ever have to sleep rough. That is why we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy. This sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now, but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all. The Government has now committed over £1.2 billion to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over the spending review period. In its first year, the Rough Sleeping Initiative provided over 1,750 new bed spaces and 500 staff.</p>","South Derbyshire","Mrs Heather Wheeler",,"2019-05-21T10:55:11.68Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126493/answer","Biography information for Mrs Heather Wheeler","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126493/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126493/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2019-05-14","Sleeping Rough","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, what recent assessment he has made of the (a) adequacy of the methodology used to measure rough sleeping and (b) accuracy of the data produced as a result of deploying that methodology.","false","Biography information for Daniel Zeichner","Cambridge","Daniel Zeichner","254208"

The YCS now has experienced, directly accountable, leadership in the post of Executive Director and two new Deputy Director posts with responsibility for reform, placements and casework; assurance and contracted services.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Plans for extending the autonomy of governors in the YSE should be introduced as soon as is practical.</p></td><td><p><strong>Partially achieved.</strong> The YCS has devolved additional funds and spending powers for YCS governors regarding education (amounting to £1.8m across the four public-sector YOIs in 2019/20), and we are considering other ways in which we can extend their autonomy and flexibility to innovate.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Immediate action must be taken to appoint a skilled individual to the proposed new post of Director of the YSE.</p></td><td><p><strong>Fully achieved.</strong> The YCS has had a dedicated Executive Director, accountable to ministers, since April 2017.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>All new staff in the YSE should have appropriate skills and knowledge of working with young people.</p></td><td><p><strong>Fully achieved.</strong> The YCS established a bespoke recruitment route and induction training programme in April 2018 to ensure staff are recruited with the right skills and values for working with young people. All new recruits will be expected to complete the new professionalisation programme (see below). We have used this recruitment route to expand the capacity of YOIs – there were 315 more Band 3-5 frontline officers in the YCS at the end of 2018 than at the end of 2017, and increase of 35%.[1]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A training programme for existing staff at all levels of the YSE should be developed to heighten and develop their skills working with young people.</p></td><td><p><strong>Fully achieved.</strong> The YCS has established a youth custody professionalisation programme (to foundation degree level) for frontline staff of Bands 3 and 4 or their equivalents in the private sector. Thee staff will be transitioned into a new Band 4 Youth Justice Specialist role upon completion of the training. Over 400 staff have been enrolled on this training to date, and the first YJ Specialists were confirmed in post this month. We are developing further training options for managers.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The MoJ should identify immediately what additional measures can be taken in each YOI and STC to improve the safety of young people.</p></td><td><p><strong>Fully achieved.</strong> The YCS has introduced a new evidence-based behaviour management strategy focusing on proactive relationship-building and positive reinforcement. This will sit alongside a new holistic care framework for children and staff developed by the NHS, the recruitment of more psychology staff in YOIs, new critical case panels for the children who present the most severe issues, and the building of two new Enhanced Support Units (ESUs).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A comprehensive review of the specific needs of young people and the specific forms of interventions required should be undertaken as an essential prerequisite to opening new specialist units in YOIs and STCs. Appropriate specialist staff should also be appointed by the time such units become operational.</p></td><td><p><strong>Fully achieved. </strong> The YCS has a detailed evidence-based operating model and eligibility criteria for ESUs developed by psychological and healthcare staff. Dedicated staff were in post for each before becoming operational.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>As a priority, specific consideration must be given to the over-representation of Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) young people in the YSE and further action be taken urgently to ensure young BAME people do not experience discrimination whilst in custody.</p></td><td><p><strong>Partially achieved.</strong> The MoJ has created a dedicated youth disproportionality team with a key focus on explaining or changing disproportionate outcomes for BAME children in the justice system and the YCS has introduced a new behaviour management framework which requires each establishment to demonstrate a commitment to addressing discrimination and disadvantage and to promote equitable outcomes for children.[2]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The government should carry out a clear needs analysis of young people in custody, with a particular focus on mental health, mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. This will allow full details of the cohort and what services they need to aid effective and appropriate commissioning.</p></td><td><p><strong>Partially achieved.</strong> The MoJ carried out a comprehensive cohort analysis, including mental health needs, of the youth secure estate at the start of the programme to guide the development of reform proposals and service commissioning. Comprehensive identification of children’s needs relating to neurodiversity and mental health are performed on entry into custody by healthcare and this process itself is under review (see below).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A review of the use of the Comprehensive Health Assessment Tool (CHAT) should be undertaken to ensure it is effectively collecting and communicating the information about individual young people that is needed.</p></td><td><p><strong>Partially achieved.</strong> A comprehensive review of the CHAT has been undertaken by NHS England and its conclusions are being finalised, after which an action plan will be developed to implement its recommendations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ministers should consider removing the requirement for 30 hours of education and replacing it with a national framework based on ensuring each young person has mastered the basics of learning and can develop relevant academic and vocational skills.</p></td><td><p><strong>Not yet achieved.</strong> We are retendering education contracts for 2021 and intend to test elements of core day and curriculum flexibility with our current providers to inform this exercise.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>National minimum standards of experience should be required for teaching in YSE establishments, with greater consideration given to the calibre of teaching staff recruited.</p></td><td><p><strong>Not yet achieved.</strong> We are retendering education contracts for 2021 and as part of this we are exploring new models and types of provider, including the staffing requirements.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>For the purposes of the pilot, the MoJ should consider direct management of the 2 secure schools through a national agency, government department or local authority model.</p></td><td><p><strong>Rejected</strong>. Secure schools will be set up and run by not-for-profit secure academy trusts. Providers will have to have a clear child-focused ethos at their core and a proven record of the knowledge and skills required to work with children in crisis. Secure academy trusts will enter into a funding agreement with the Secretary of State for Justice and be accountable to him</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Plans for piloting secure schools should give serious consideration to how provision for young women could be made within them.</p></td><td><p><strong>Fully achieved.</strong> All children that are currently deemed suitable for placement into YOIs and STCs, including girls, will be considered for Secure Schools. In our published ‘Guidance on How to Apply to Run a Secure School’,[3] we have advised potential providers that they will deliver a provision that caters to the specific needs of girls and demonstrate how an understanding of their lives and diverse needs will inform interventions at the secure school.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Each of the piloted secure schools should be designed to test evidence-based approaches with a specific cohort of young people, for example those serving long (or short) sentences, or those that would benefit from, and respond to, a therapeutic model of intervention and care.</p></td><td><p><strong>Rejected. </strong> Any boy or girl aged 12 to 17 who is remanded or sentenced into youth detention accommodation could be placed into a secure school, and we expect them to accommodate children with a wide range of complex needs. The secure schools model has been designed to deliver an individualised, therapeutic approach to meeting children’s needs that ultimately addresses their offending behaviour and improve their life chances, which is based on evidence of what works and we believe they underpin best practice for any type of youth custody provision. Rigorous evaluations will be carried out to evaluate the benefits and impacts on children within custody, the estate’s workforce, and the community as a whole</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>[1] https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-offender-management-service-workforce-statistics</p><p>[2] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-bridges-a-positive-behaviour-framework-for-the-children-and-young-people-secure-estate</p><p>[3] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/secure-schools-how-to-apply</p>","Charnwood","Edward Argar",,"2019-05-20T13:26:24.22Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126632/answer","Biography information for Edward Argar","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126632/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126632/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-05-14","Young Offender Institutions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, which of the recommendations made in the Youth Custody Improvement Board report, published in February 2017, have been (a) fully, (b) partially and (c) not achieved.","false","Biography information for Richard Burgon","Leeds East","Richard Burgon","254236"

At that time, IPSA expected the programme to be completed in 2017-18. The full costs of the system are now forecast to be £8.253 million.</p><p>The increase in cost was due in part to the unexpected General Election of June 2017 which diverted all IPSA work for up to nine months to supporting MPs who left or joined parliament, and increased supplier costs. Costs also increased following our change of suppliers in September 2018 to improve the quality of IPSA’s IT support. IPSA also spent longer than anticipated on testing the new system so that IPSA could have confidence that it would be fully secure and free of technical problems. The increases in cost have been partly mitigated by savings elsewhere in IPSA’s budget.</p><p>The new system administers MPs’ pay and business costs more efficiently and effectively, providing improved support to MPs and their staff while saving taxpayers’ money. MPs and their staff will benefit from these improvements by being able to access information and make changes to their staffing budget or office leases without needing to contact IPSA staff. They can now also access IPSA’s system directly through their secure parliamentary digital account without an additional logon. MPs and staff no longer need to send IPSA paper receipts and invoices through the post, but can scan and photograph them and upload them to IPSA digitally. The new system can also reimburse MPs’ staff directly rather than via the MP. On the basis of the experience so far, IPSA estimate that MPs will need to spend around 30 per cent less time overall on the new system than they did on the old one.</p><p>However, IPSA recognise that many MPs and their staff still need to get used to the new system. IPSA are therefore conducting group and one-to-one training in Parliament and have staff available on the phone to answer queries. IPSA are putting on more such training sessions in response to demand, with a regular presence in Portcullis House.</p><p>IPSA will shortly conduct a survey to gather more feedback about the new system, with plans for further improvements in due course. IPSA will report to the Speaker’s Committee for the IPSA later in the year on the overall costs and benefits of IPSA Online.</p>","Broxbourne","Mr Charles Walker",,"2019-05-20T12:41:32.997Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126071/answer","Biography information for Sir Charles Walker","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126071/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1126071/answer",,,,,"90","Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority","Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority","2019-05-13","Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority: ICT","1","House of Commons","To ask the hon.
