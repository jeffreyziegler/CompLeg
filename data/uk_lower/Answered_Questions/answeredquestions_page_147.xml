As part of this duty, they must have regard to statutory safeguarding guidance, 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' and 'Working Together to Safeguard Children'. Available respectively at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2</a>. The guidance sets out the steps that they must take and the systems that must be in place to provide support for children at each stage of their education. In the context of both guidance documents ‘children’ includes 16 and 17 year olds.</p><p> </p><p>Ofsted inspectors report on whether or not arrangements for safeguarding and supporting children and learners are effective. Ofsted has published guidance to inspectors setting out the approach they should take to inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills – <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills-from-september-2015" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills-from-september-2015</a>. This makes clear that safeguarding is not just about protecting children and learners from deliberate harm and neglect and relates to broader aspects of care and education. Pupils’ and students’ personal development, behaviour and welfare is also a key area of focus in all inspections of education providers conducted under Ofsted’s Common inspection framework.</p><p> </p><p>We are clear in 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' and 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' about the importance of early help assessments. Early help means providing support as soon as a problem emerges at any point in a child’s life. These assessments should be undertaken by school and college staff for children, especially vulnerable children, aged 16 and 17 as appropriate to their local circumstances. Effective early help can prevent problems escalating. In some cases, however, the school or college may consider that the child is a child in need, as defined under the Children Act 1989, and make a referral to children’s social care.</p><p> </p><p>We are currently conducting a range of work to assess and improve the support children in need receive, including those experiencing mental ill-health, domestic abuse, exploitation or substance misuse. The children in need review and call for evidence, which was launched on 16 March, is looking at the educational outcomes for all children in need, including 16 and 17 year olds, and what support they need to improve those outcomes. The Children’s Social Care Innovation Programme is also funding projects to assess how early help and contextual safeguarding can help protect adolescents and prepare them for adult life.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900391/answer",,,,,,"2018-05-16T15:08:36Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900391/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900391/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-05-09","Pupils: Disadvantaged","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment he has made of the quality of pastoral support provided within the education system for 16 and 17 year olds identified as vulnerable.","false","Biography information for Ben Bradley","Mansfield","Ben Bradley","142511"

These limits are normally set at 50mph in accordance with published standards and in agreement with the police. Highways England can increase this speed limit to 55 mph or 60 mph where it is safe to do so. These speed restrictions are lifted once the roadworks are completed.</p><p> </p><p>Highways England uses variable speed limits on smart motorways to manage traffic flows at busy times and in response to incidents on the network. A system of road sensors is used to detect actual vehicle speeds and the rate of flow of traffic on a motorway. Based on this information an algorithm is used to determine whether a reduced speed limit is required in order to maintain safety or optimise traffic flow. The algorithm works out the optimum speed for traffic by comparing the observed vehicle speed and traffic flow against the historical norm for a particular stretch of road. The automated system then activates the reduced speed limit at a level that will maintain safety and allow traffic to flow as freely as possible. Speed limits are set to 40mph to maintain safety when a slow moving or stopped vehicle is detected and are set to 50 or 60 mph to optimise traffic flow based on a number of factors detected by the sensors, including average speed, flow rate and traffic density.</p><p> </p><p>The algorithm ensures that speed limits are returned to 70 mph as soon as the detected traffic parameters indicate that this can be done safely. Highways England traffic operations staff are also able to activate or deactivate variable speed limits manually based on observed traffic patterns should this be required.</p><p> </p><p>These measures ensure that automated variable speed limits are set appropriately and that variable speed limits do not remain in place for longer than is necessary.</p><p> </p><p>Highways England routinely monitors, reviews and learns lessons on the performance of variable speed limits on smart motorway schemes to ensure that the speed limits that are set are appropriate for the traffic conditions.</p>","Hereford and South Herefordshire","Jesse Norman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900498/answer",,,,,,"2018-05-16T10:14:35.72Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900498/answer","Biography information for Jesse Norman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900498/answer","Hereford and South Herefordshire","Jesse Norman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900498/answer/previousversion/57775","Biography information for Jesse Norman","27","Transport","Transport","2018-05-09","Motorways: Speed Limits","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what the criteria are for activating an average speed monitored stretch of motorway; what measures are in place to (a) prevent an artificially low speed limit being implemented and (b) ensure that an average speed limit camera check is in place for no longer than necessary; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Sir Greg Knight","East Yorkshire","Sir Greg Knight","142357"

As such, they are ensuring that each of their investment programmes impacts directly on disabled people. For the financial year 2017/2018 Sport England invested £1.2 million into the English Federation of Disability Sport, now known as the Activity Alliance, to provide expertise and services in marketing and communications, research and insight, and engaging with disabled people and the disability sector. In addition, all of Sport England’s major capital investments are required to make their facilities accessible, and Sport England publish online tools and guidance to help designers, building owners and operators create accessible facilities.</p><p> </p><p>Government recognises the value of shooting as an outdoor recreation and is keen to ensure that everyone who wants to be involved has the opportunity to do so. Between 2017 and 2021, Sport England is investing £1,290,000 in British Shooting to continue to support more people to get involved in shooting sports and to develop talented athletes within the sport. The investment has also supported British Shooting to integrate Disability Shooting GB into its own governance and operation from April 2017.</p>","Chatham and Aylesford","Tracey Crouch","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900011/answer",,,,,,"2018-05-16T09:53:57.143Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900011/answer","Biography information for Tracey Crouch","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/900011/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2018-05-08","Sports: Disability","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, what discussions he has had with Sport England on progress in increasing disability participation in (a) sport and (b) shooting.","false","Biography information for Bill Wiggin","North Herefordshire","Bill Wiggin","141720"
