The Strategy is taking a multi-strand approach. Law enforcement is very important, but it also depends on partnerships across a number of sectors, such as education, health, social services, housing, youth services, victim services and others.</p><p>Our analysis highlights that a major factor behind the recent increases in serious violence is changes in the drugs markets. The strategy says that law enforcement plays a vital role in tackling these offences, but big shifts in crime tend to be driven by factors outside the police’s control such as drug market changes.</p><p>Police have the resources they need to carry out their vital work. In 2017, the Policing Minister visited and spoke to every police force in England and Wales about the demands on policing. That is why we have provided a strong and comprehensive funding settlement that will increase funding by £460m from 2018/19, including £280m of direct funding raised through increases in Council Tax precept which police forces can spend locally. Decisions about frontline policing, and how resources are best deployed, are for Chief Constables and democratically accountable Police and Crime Commissioners.</p><p>The strategy sets out action that is being taken to address knife crime. This includes the national knife crime media campaign, #knifefree, to raise awareness of the consequences of knife crime among young people and to encourage them to take up positive activities. We will continue to encourage police forces in England and Wales to undertake a series of coordinated national weeks of action to tackle knife crime under Operation Sceptre.

Our contribution to this is funded from the Government's Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). The UK's share of the UN Peacekeeping Budget is currently 5.8%.

We do not make mission specific contributions. To give an indication of costs, we pay £34m per year to cover all EU CSDP Missions (Peacekeeping and non-Peacekeeping).</p><p>(c) The UK contributes to the NATO Kosovo Force through our overall contributions to NATO Operation Balkans, in accordance with the UK's NATO cost share in force at the time that the budget was set.

This is so that the NHS trust can consider if a charge for NHS treatment was applied incorrectly and requires cancellation. The Home Office has introduced additional safeguards to ensure those from the Windrush generation are not adversely affected by measures designed to protect benefits and services.

Persistent low income is defined as having had low income in at least 3 out of the last 4 years. Also a measure of material deprivation is published which measures whether individuals have access to a range of goods and services so provides a broader measure of living standards which goes beyond assessing income only.</p><p> </p><p>No one measure of poverty is able to fully capture the concept of a low standard of living in all economic circumstances.

The government is committed to preparing vulnerable children for adult life and we recognise the importance of the transition into adulthood.</p><p> </p><p>We are pleased that the report welcomes the recent publications under the government’s Children in Need Review. The review is a priority for the government and a significant opportunity to review the support we offer vulnerable children to help them reach their potential. As part of the review we have published new data on the educational and Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) outcomes for children in need.</p><p> </p><p>Alongside the new data we have launched a call for evidence to look at the support offered to children in need and asked the Education Endowment Fund and the Early Intervention Foundation to look at the evidence for what works to support these children and improve their outcomes. This will help us assess the adequacy of the support children in need are given and to decide what steps should be taken to improve that support. We will consider any evidence we receive about transition support as part of the review.</p><p> </p><p>It is important that children in need receive the right support throughout childhood to ensure they are ready for adult life. Therefore, we are continuing to implement our reform programme as set out in ‘Putting Children First’ with the aim that all children, no matter where they live, should have access to the same high quality care and support to meet their needs. This includes stronger initial training and clarity about the knowledge and skills social workers need in their jobs and creating an environment where innovation can flourish and frontline practice is driven by evidence. We are also taking decisive action to improve services in inadequate local authorities through our interventions programme and by implementing a new improvement strategy for local authorities at risk of delivering inadequate children’s social care services.</p><p> </p><p><strong><br> </strong></p><p> </p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","144404 ; 144405 ; 144406 ; 144407","2018-05-23T12:45:19.98Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904681/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904681/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904681/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-05-15","Children: Social Services","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment he has made of the potential merits of the recommendations made in the report Crumbling Futures, published by Children’s Society in March 2018.","false","Biography information for Emma Hardy","Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle","Emma Hardy","144403"
