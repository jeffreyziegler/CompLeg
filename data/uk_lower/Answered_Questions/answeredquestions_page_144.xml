The Strategy is taking a multi-strand approach. Law enforcement is very important, but it also depends on partnerships across a number of sectors, such as education, health, social services, housing, youth services, victim services and others.</p><p>Our analysis highlights that a major factor behind the recent increases in serious violence is changes in the drugs markets. The strategy says that law enforcement plays a vital role in tackling these offences, but big shifts in crime tend to be driven by factors outside the policeâs control such as drug market changes.</p><p>Police have the resources they need to carry out their vital work. In 2017, the Policing Minister visited and spoke to every police force in England and Wales about the demands on policing. That is why we have provided a strong and comprehensive funding settlement that will increase funding by Â£460m from 2018/19, including Â£280m of direct funding raised through increases in Council Tax precept which police forces can spend locally. Decisions about frontline policing, and how resources are best deployed, are for Chief Constables and democratically accountable Police and Crime Commissioners.</p><p>The strategy sets out action that is being taken to address knife crime. This includes the national knife crime media campaign, #knifefree, to raise awareness of the consequences of knife crime among young people and to encourage them to take up positive activities. We will continue to encourage police forces in England and Wales to undertake a series of coordinated national weeks of action to tackle knife crime under Operation Sceptre.

Our contribution to this is funded from the Government's Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). The UK's share of the UN Peacekeeping Budget is currently 5.8%.

On Monday 26 March an event was held to commemorate the centenary of the appointment of Marshal Foch as Supreme Allied Commander on the Western Front, at the statue of the Marshal in Lower Grosvenor Gardens. It was attended by the French Ambassador, and the French Minister of State for Veterans and Remembrance.</p><p> </p><p>On 8 August we will commemorate the centenary of the the Battle of Amiens and the subsequent 'Hundred Days' Offensive with an event for 2,000 guests in Amiens Cathedral in Northern France. It is being delivered in partnership with the governments of Australia, Canada, France and the United States of America.</p><p> </p><p>The governmentâs programme of centenary events will culminate on 11 November 2018 with a series of events across the UK to mark the centenary of the Armistice. The National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph will follow traditional lines, to respect its wider purpose in remembering the fallen of all conflicts. The traditional veteransâ parade will then be followed by a civilian procession made up of 10,000 members of the public who wish to show their thanks to a generation who gave so much for the freedoms we enjoy today. An announcement regarding the public ballot for tickets to participate in this procession will be made shortly. During the day, church and other bells will ring out as they did in 1918 to mark the end of the war.</p><p> </p><p>The commemorations will conclude in the evening with a national service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey in London. Similar services will also take place in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to the national events, the other elements of government programme, such as the Schools' Battlefields Tours, the schools 'Great War Debates', the Victoria Cross Paving Stones, and funding for the repair and restoration of War Memorials will continue, to ensure that the final year of the War and the Armistice are commemorated appropriately. Historic England will also continue to research and conserve not only war memorials and historic buildings, but trenches and other fieldworks constructed during the war for training purposes, to make sure that our history can be enjoyed by present and future generations. Two of these, the practise trenches at Short Fell, Northumberland, and the earthwork model training trenches at Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, have been added to the National Heritage List for England. A range of information, including detailed research on various sites across the country, can be found on their website.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has no plans to create any lasting natural memorials to the First World War, but I am aware of, and commend, the Woodland Trustâs First World War Centenary Woods initiative involving the planting of millions of trees in four Centenary Woods across the UK, creating beautiful places for the next generation to enjoy whilst providing a living legacy to all those affected by the conflict.</p>",,"Lord Ashton of Hyde",,"2018-05-25T12:06:31.21Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906035/answer","Biography information for Lord Ashton of Hyde","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906035/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906035/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2018-05-16","World War I: Anniversaries","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War; and whether there are plans to dedicate any lasting natural memorials.","false","Biography information for Baroness Young of Old Scone",,"Baroness Young of Old Scone","HL7959"
