It recognises that for the UK to be a world-leading digital economy that works for everyone, it is crucial that everyone has the digital skills they need to fully participate in society.</p><p> </p><p>In September 2018 DCMS launched a £400,000 Innovation Fund to tackle the digital exclusion of older and disabled people. Three pilot projects will address the digital exclusion of these groups with a view to replicating and scaling successful interventions in future.</p><p> </p><p>DCMS are also supporting the development of Local Digital Skills Partnerships to encourage collaboration between key regional stakeholders to design and deliver innovative digital skills provision locally. Working closely with regional LEPs and Combined Authorities, three regions - Lancashire, Heart of the South West and the West Midlands have already launched with a further three regions - South East, Cheshire and Warrington and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly coming on stream over the coming months.</p><p> </p><p>On 18th September 2018, we published plans to improve adult basic digital skills.</p><p>We will introduce an entitlement to full funding for basic digital courses from 2020, similar to the entitlements already in place for maths and English.

Through around 3000 libraries across England we provide a trusted network of accessible locations with trained staff and volunteers, free Wi-Fi, computers, and other technology as well as Assisted Digital access to a wide range of digital public services where individuals are unable to access these services independently. There are numerous library device loan schemes across the country, many of which have a high take-up by older people.</p><p> </p><p>Government is also tackling digital exclusion via the ‘Future Digital Inclusion’ programme funded by DfE, managed by the Good Things Foundation and delivered through the 5,000 strong national Online Centres network based out of libraries and other community spaces. There is provision across the East Midlands. To date, this programme has supported 1 million adult learners to develop their basic digital skills, many adults aged over 65 have benefited from “Future Digital Inclusion” programme (approx. 170,000). Further, the NHS Digital ‘Widening Digital Participation’ programme develops projects that enable people in England to improve their digital health skills and to increase their access to digital services and tools that support their health and care.

This includes promoting staff wellbeing and addressing all forms of discrimination including against those that speak up about concerns. This work will be delivered as part of the Workforce Implementation Plan announced in the Long Term Plan.</p><p> </p><p>The Department has appointed an independent National Guardian, Dr Henrietta Hughes, who leads over 750 local Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, covering every NHS trust in England.

Schools are responsible for ensuring that each of their pupils is engaged, challenged and has opportunity to achieve their full academic potential. The government’s ongoing education reforms have given headteachers considerable flexibility over their use of the funding allocated to their schools, as they are best placed to support and address the specific needs of their pupils – including those who are classed as having English as an additional language (EAL).</p><p>​We recognise that having a large intake of EAL pupils can present challenges for a school. Through the national funding formula (NFF) for schools, introduced in April 2018, state-funded schools attract funding for pupils with EAL who have been in the school system in England for up to 3 years. This funding equates to an additional £515 per primary school pupil and an additional £1,385 per secondary school pupil by the time the formula is fully implemented. Schools in which more than 10% of pupils joined mid-way through the school year also attract funding through the mobility factor in the NFF if their local authority uses this factor in their local formula. Furthermore, schools are also able to use their pupil premium funding to support pupils with EAL who are classed as disadvantaged, through having been eligible for free school meals at any point in the last 6 years, or through being looked after or previously in local authority care.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2019-02-01T11:11:40.623Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047654/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047654/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047654/answer",,,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-01-24","Children: English Language","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking to support children who are learning English as a second language.","false","Biography information for David Simpson","Upper Bann","David Simpson","212344"
