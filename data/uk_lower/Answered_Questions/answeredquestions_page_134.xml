In the case of FTSE 350 companies, there should be an externally facilitated evaluation at least every three years with the external facilitator identified for shareholders in the annual report, and with the chairman acting on the findings.</p><p> </p><p>Shareholders, where they are regulated, and fund managers must comply with the terms of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which is enforced by the Financial Conduct Authority. Institutional investors also have fiduciary duties to their clients and must comply with the terms of their investment mandate. Additionally, the UK Stewardship Code sets out best practice for institutional investors in terms of their stewardship responsibilities. The FRC will be consulting on a revised Code later this year.</p><p> </p><p>It is the responsibility of a company’s board of directors to assess the effectiveness of remuneration advisers it appoints and a company has a statutory obligation (under Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended in 2013) to disclose certain details in respect of remuneration advisers’ services, including whether and how the remuneration committee has satisfied itself that the advice received was objective and independent.

Reformed apprenticeships and new T Levels will ensure that the technical option is world-class and provides a high quality alternative to A levels.</p><p>T Levels will be substantial programmes, so we expect that in future the majority of students will follow either an academic programme (e.g. three A levels) or a technical programme (a T level). We do appreciate that students may change their minds, and we will ensure there are appropriate bridging courses to make movement between the two options easily accessible. In principle, we believe that a student should be able to take an A level alongside their T Level, particularly if it supports progression outcomes for their chosen T Level. We are particularly supportive of high attaining students who want to take Core maths or an A level in maths alongside their T Level.</p><p>In the response to the consultation on T Level implementation, we committed to reviewing qualifications that currently attract government funding for post-16 study. In designing this review, we will ensure that continued funding is only available for the group of qualifications that serve a genuine purpose, are of a high quality and enable students to progress to meaningful outcomes.</p>","Guildford","Anne Milton",,"2018-06-26T11:09:06.587Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926525/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926525/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926525/answer",,,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-06-18","Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, whether it is his policy to ensure that young people choose between a wholly technical and wholly academic education when aged 16.","false","Biography information for Robert Halfon","Harlow","Robert Halfon","154676"

Technical Awards are broad, high-quality level 1 and level 2 qualifications in non-English Baccalaureate subjects that equip students with applied knowledge not usually acquired through general education. They focus on applied study of a sector or occupational group, including the acquisition of associate practical or technical skills where appropriate. Each Technical Award is equivalent to a GCSE in robustness and challenge.</p><p>It is important that young people are able to make informed choices about their future education, training and jobs. Our careers strategy, published in December 2017, says that by 2020 schools should make sure that their students experience at least seven encounters with employers, at least one a year from year 7 to 13. Some of these encounters should be with employers working in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.</p><p>In January 2018, we introduced a new law which requires all maintained secondary schools and academies to make sure that students hear from a range providers about approved technical education qualifications or apprenticeships.

We are working closely with stakeholders to ensure that this happens as smoothly as possible. The overall amount of money available for supporting victims of modern slavery will not fall, but by making these changes more money is being made available to treble the period of “move on” support, which will happen at the same time, and will help people leaving victim support with their transition to other arrangements.</p><p>When considering the level of these rates, the essential needs of potential victims were assessed to be comparable to the needs of asylum seekers. This is why the tested and established methodology that has been developed to measure the level of subsistence for asylum seekers will be adopted to measure the level of subsistence for potential victims of modern slavery. The rate is reassessed annually, and in 2018 was increased to £37.75. Where it has been identified that victims of slavery have needs above those of asylum seekers or have additional entitlements under the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Beings, these needs are met within the existing Adult Victims of Modern Slavery Care Contract. The methodology includes an allowance for individuals to purchase their food, and this will be taken into consideration when considering the level of subsistence for potential victims who live in catered accommodation, to ensure consistency throughout support. <br> <br>Victims will continue to receive dedicated and expert support, which is tailored to their unique needs as victims of modern slavery. This includes access to legal aid, counselling, NHS medical and dental services. This will ensure there is a consistent approach for all individuals receiving similar government support. It is also essential that we target support to confirmed victims, at the point they need it most.</p><p>We are working closely with the Salvation Army and the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner to ensure that the implementation of this change is as smooth as possible.</p>","Louth and Horncastle","Victoria Atkins",,"2018-06-26T11:29:46.587Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926628/answer","Biography information for Victoria Atkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926628/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926628/answer",,,,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2018-06-18","Slavery","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the Answer of 10 May 2018 to Question 140986, when the alignment of subsistence rates for victims of trafficking with asylum seekers is planed to take place; and what the new subsistence rates are to be set at for victims of modern slavery supported by the National Referral Mechanism living in (a) accommodation in a safe house with food provided and (b) a safe house where they purchase their own food who (i) have applied for asylum and (ii) are receiving outreach support.","true","Biography information for Vernon Coaker","Gedling","Vernon Coaker","154593"

However, while a Northwest Runway at Heathrow will help to secure the UK’s status as a global aviation hub, other airports will continue to develop their point-to-point networks. The Department’s aviation forecasts show that passenger numbers and flights at airports within the South East (excluding Heathrow) will increase by 33 per cent and 20 per cent respectively between 2016 and 2050 with expansion at Heathrow.</p><p> </p><p>London is the largest aviation origin and destination market in the world, and the forecasts show demand for this market growing further. This will continue to provide opportunities for airports around London and in the South East, including Stansted, to increase their services alongside any expansion at Heathrow over the longer term. Individual airport commercial strategies – which are not modelled – could help these airports to grow even faster and further.</p><p> </p><p>Lastly, as the Secretary of State set out in his oral statement on 05 June, any new operational runway at Heathrow is still a number of years away. This is why Government supports airports beyond Heathrow making best use of their existing runways. However, the Government recognises that the development of airports can have positive and negative effects, including on noise levels, and it considers that any proposals should be judged on their individual merits by the appropriate planning authority, taking careful account of all relevant considerations, particularly economic and environmental.</p>","Hereford and South Herefordshire","Jesse Norman",,"2018-06-21T16:16:15.527Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926722/answer","Biography information for Jesse Norman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926722/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/926722/answer",,,,,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2018-06-18","Heathrow Airport: Construction","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what assessment has his Department made of the effect of Heathrow expansion on airport capacity in (a) the South East and (b) Stansted Airport.","false","Biography information for Mrs Kemi Badenoch","Saffron Walden","Mrs Kemi Badenoch","154797"
