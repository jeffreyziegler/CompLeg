These data do not provide enough information to link the deaths to poor care. It is not possible to determine from these figures how or where the condition originated. There are many explanations as to why someone becomes malnourished: for example they may have cancer of the digestive tract, which means they can not eat properly or can not absorb nutrients; they may have suffered from a stroke or have advanced dementia which can cause difficulties chewing and swallowing; or they may abuse alcohol and so not eat properly. The deceased may have been malnourished before they went into hospital (for any of the reasons mentioned previously), and perhaps only have been in hospital a very short time and the malnutrition may have nothing to do with not being fed properly in hospital. Also, in the majority of deaths in hospitals from falls, it is likely the fall occurred elsewhere, not in the hospital.

The 16-19 Bursary Fund is the principal scheme. Under the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund, young people are eligible for awards of up to £1,200 per year (in particular, vulnerable groups that generally do not receive financial support from their families). Those not in these particular vulnerable groups, but who still need financial support, can apply to their education institution for discretionary bursary support. Each institution receives an allocation to make available these discretionary bursaries.</p><p>The department spoke with a sample of schools, colleges and other 16-19 education providers in 2018 to help us understand how the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund was being used and to assess the extent to which discretionary bursary allocations met the needs of students in the different institutions. Providers were using the available funds to support their most disadvantaged students, but there were different responses on the adequacy of funding. We are continuing to keep the use of the fund under review to inform our understanding of whether it is providing effective support to our most economically disadvantaged students.</p><p>With regard to its effectiveness in promoting social mobility, providers have the flexibility to target those young people in most need of financial support to stay on in further education and training. This flexibility helps to ensure that the poorest students get the same opportunities available to those with more financial support, for example, by purchasing equipment for technical courses, taking part in trips, purchasing books, participating in industry placements and getting support with UCAS fees. The majority of providers that the department spoke to in 2018 confirmed that this funding was making a significant impact on the ability of young people to access opportunities.</p>","Guildford","Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047035/answer",,,,,,"2019-01-29T16:50:11.217Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047035/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047035/answer","Guildford","Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1047035/answer/previousversion/97893","Biography information for Anne Milton","60","Education","Education","2019-01-23","16-19 Bursary Fund: Social Mobility","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the 16 - 19 bursary in promoting social mobility.","false","Biography information for Gordon Marsden","Blackpool South","Gordon Marsden","211664"

That is 0.7% of spend on medicines in primary care. Spend on specials has reduced significantly since 2010 when it was £136 million. This is the consequence of a reduction in the prescribing of specials and the introduction of reimbursement prices for the most commonly prescribed specials. Specials listed with a price in the Drug Tariff incentivise community pharmacies to source the special at the lowest price possible which creates a competitive market and reduces costs. Out of the £65 million spent on specials in 2018, £20 million was spent on specials listed with a price in the Drug Tariff covering more than half of the items dispensed. The Department aims to include more specials with a reimbursement price in the Drug Tariff and seek alternative arrangements for specials that are not commonly prescribed and therefore cannot be listed with a reimbursement price.

The Withdrawal Agreement offers a time-limited implementation period that provides a bridge to the future relationship, allowing businesses to continue trading as now until the end of 2020.
