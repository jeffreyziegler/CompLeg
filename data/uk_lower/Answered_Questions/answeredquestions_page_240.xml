The change reduces the total amount a working-age household can receive in benefits to £20,000 for couples and lone parents (£13,400 for single adults with no children) in Great Britain outside Greater London. Within Greater London the level is £23,000 for couples and lone parents (£15,410 for single adults with no children).</p><p>Evidence from the 2014 evaluation of the cap showed very little, if any, impact on homelessness as a direct result of the cap. In the cases of a small numbers of capped households who had been evicted, the Local Authorities noted that they had other reasons for rent arrears and they also failed to engage with relevant services, they were considered intentionally homeless.</p><p> </p><p>The lower cap is still the equivalent of gross family earnings of £25k, and £29k in London. There are a number of exemptions, for example, for people receiving disability payments or people who work and qualify for Working Tax Credits. Discretionary Housing Payments can be made by local authorities to help people adjust to the benefit cap and those payments can be made to prevent people becoming homeless.</p><p> </p><p>To help Local Authorities protect the most vulnerable and to support households adjusting to the reforms, the Government has provided around £900 million funding for the Discretionary Housing Payments scheme since 2011.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage","4987","2017-07-18T14:29:25.98Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/751693/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/751693/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/751693/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2017-07-13","Social Security Benefits: Homelessness","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment he has made of the effect of the reduction in the benefit cap in November 2016 on the level of homelessness since that date.","false","Biography information for Andrew Gwynne","Denton and Reddish","Andrew Gwynne","4986"

The assessment period runs for a full calendar month from the date of entitlement, and the UC pay date will be 7 calendar days after the end of the assessment period. This mirrors the world of work and allows for a 1 month period in which to gather information about a claimants’ earnings.

The Commission rightly concludes that too often life chances can be determined not by effort and talents but where you come from, your parents’ situation and what school you attend. The Department will set out further details on policy to tackle this social injustice in due course.</p><p> </p><p>Thanks to the Government’s reforms, there are 1.8 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools than in 2010, and we are delivering three million apprenticeship places, opening up access to our higher education system and investing £500 million a year into technical education.</p><p> </p><p>Improving social mobility requires support from all parts of society: government, employers and civic organisations. Last year, we launched our £72 million Opportunity Area programme. In these 12 social mobility ‘coldspots’ we are working with a range of local partners to break the link between background and destination. We know these areas face some of the most entrenched challenges, as described by the Social Mobility Commission’s Index last year. Our approach here goes beyond what the Department and central government can do – extending to local authorities, schools, academy sponsors, local and national businesses, Local Enterprise Partnerships, FE colleges, universities, the voluntary sector, and more.</p><p> </p><p>I spoke at a Westminster Hall Debate about government policies on social mobility and the Commission’s ‘Time for Change’ report on 11 July.
