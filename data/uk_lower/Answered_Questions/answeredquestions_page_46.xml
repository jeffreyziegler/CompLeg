To that effect, we use ante-mortem tests that measure the animals’ immune response to infection with the bovine TB bacterium (<em>Mycobacterium bovis – M. bovis</em>), rather than rely on direct detection methods.</p><p> </p><p>The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, commonly known as the ‘skin test’, together with the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), is the legal standard approved in the EU legislation for the diagnosis of TB in live cattle in the UK. As with cases of TB in humans, only a proportion of those animals infected with <em>M. bovis</em> and reacting to a tuberculin skin test or IGRA display gross lesions of TB when subjected to post-mortem meat inspection in the slaughterhouse.</p><p> </p><p>In 2017 (the last year for which an analysis of post-mortem findings is available), approximately 60% of the 32,000 cattle compulsorily removed for bovine TB control reasons in England as skin test reactors or IGRA positives did not have visible lesions of TB on post-mortem and were also negative for <em>M. bovis</em> on bacteriological culture (where performed).</p><p> </p><p>Defra and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) are constantly striving for new ways to maximise the effectiveness of TB testing of cattle to achieve the objectives of the Strategy.

A policy position paper on non-validated diagnostics for TB in cattle is now available on the APHA Vet Gateway (<a href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/vet-gateway/index.htm" target="_blank">http://apha.defra.gov.uk/vet-gateway/index.htm</a>).</p><p> </p><p>Over £4 million was allocated to TB research and development in 2018/19, with the anticipation of a similar spend this financial year.

The report is consistent with the evidence and approach that we set out in the Serious Violence Strategy which we published in April last year. Specifically, the briefing supports the Government’s view that tackling knife crime and serious violence cannot be solely focused on law enforcement, but it should also involve a multi-agency approach involving a wide range of sectors, including education, health, social services, housing, youth services, victim services and others. This is why we launched our consultation on a new legal duty to ensure public bodies take action to prevent serious violence on 1 April. The consultation explores how a legal duty will support effective multi-agency work.

Governors work closely with partner agencies and stakeholders to ensure that suitable regimes and support are in place to ensure those in our custody receive the right care. At MoJ Ministers frequently visit prisons, where governors can highlight matters of concern to them. However, most issues relating to screening are discussed with health and justice partners through normal governance structures at official level.</p><p> </p><p>Providing the right intervention at the right time is vital to improving outcomes for people with mental health issues and there is ongoing work to divert offenders away from custody where appropriate, though it is important to remember that sentencing decisions are a matter for our independent judiciary. We welcome the Sentencing Council’s development of an Overarching Principles guideline on Mental Health, which has been recently published for consultation. The guideline aims to assist the court in sentencing offenders with mental health needs.</p><p> </p><p>We continue to support NHS England’s roll out of Liaison and Diversion services, which support efforts to intervene early for vulnerable offenders and divert them into services that address the underlying causes of offending. They do so by placing clinical staff at police stations and courts to provide assessments and referrals to treatment and support. Services are currently operating across 92% of the country, with full rollout expected by 2020/21.</p><p> </p><p>We are also working with the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and Public Health England on a programme to support the greater use of community sentences with treatment requirements (CSTRs) in courts, including mental health treatment requirements. The programme facilitates processes and pathways for clinical staff in courts to screen and assess offenders for mental health (and substance misuse) issues. This provides the judiciary with effective community sentencing options as an alternative to custody. Wherever possible, screening and assessments are completed on the day of sentence by CSTR providers for mental health and substance misuse.</p><p> </p><p>For individuals who are sentenced to custody, it is crucial that MoJ and HMPPS work to create healthy, supportive prison environments. We already know that prisoners are more likely to have poor physical and mental health than the general population and that being in prison can exacerbate these issues. That is why we have ensured that over 4,000 new staff are in post to enable us to implement initiatives like the key worker role, allowing staff dedicated time to provide support to individual prisoners. These initiatives and others mean that we will be able to better support individuals with mental health needs in prison.</p>","Charnwood","Edward Argar","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1123914/answer",,,,,,"2019-05-09T16:28:50.657Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1123914/answer","Biography information for Edward Argar","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1123914/answer",,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-04-30","Offenders: Mental Illness","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what representations he has received from Prison Governors on mental health screening for offenders at sentencing.","false","Biography information for Imran Hussain","Bradford East","Imran Hussain","249321"

According to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), phonics approaches have been consistently found to be effective in supporting younger readers to master the basics of reading, with an average impact of an additional four months’ progress. Research suggests that phonics is particularly beneficial for younger pupils (four to seven year olds) as they begin to read. Teaching phonics is more effective on average than other approaches to early reading (such as whole language or alphabetic approaches), though it should be emphasised that effective phonics techniques are usually embedded in a rich literacy environment for early readers and are only one part of a successful literacy strategy[1].</p><p>In 2018 there were 163,000 more six year olds in England on track to become fluent readers compared to 2012. This represented 82% of pupils meeting the expected standard in the phonics screening check, compared to just 58% when the check was introduced in 2012.</p><p>The Department is investing £26 million in a national network of English hubs to support local schools in developing their teaching practice, with a focus on systematic phonics, early language development and reading for pleasure.

Provisional data and subject to further change</p><p>Although care is taken when processing and analysing the data, the details are subject to inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale case management system and are the best data that are available.</p><p> </p><p><br>It is important that appeals are heard as quickly as possible. Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) recognises there are delays in the system and it is in the process of recruiting more judicial office holders in order to increase capacity and help to reduce waiting times for appellants. This includes 250 judges across the First-tier Tribunal, 125 disability qualified members and up to 230 medical members.</p><p>In addition, we have recently launched a new digital service with a view to enabling speedier processing of appeals. Information on the new digital service can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/appeal-benefit-decision/submit-appeal</p><p>We are also working with the Department for Work and Pensions to understand what could be done to reduce the number of appeals being submitted to the Tribunal, through their focus on improving decision-making and the mandatory reconsideration process.</p><p>These measures will increase the capacity of the Tribunal. As a result, the number of appeals outstanding in the Tribunal is starting to fall as the number of cases heard by the Tribunal outweigh those sent to the Tribunal. If this continues, over time, we expect the time it takes for the Tribunal to hear, and the age of, appeals to reduce.</p><p>The time taken for the Tribunal to hear an appeal is mainly driven by the number of appeals sent to the Tribunal and the capacity of the Tribunal to deal with them. The number of appeals sent to the Tribunal is directly affected by changes in welfare policy.</p><p>The time it takes the Tribunal to hear an appeal is calculated from the time it is sent to the Tribunal to its final disposal. An appeal is not necessarily disposed of at its first hearing. The final disposal decision on the appeal may be reached after an earlier hearing has been adjourned (which may be directed by the judge for a variety of reasons, such as to seek further evidence), or after an earlier hearing date had been postponed (again, for a variety of reasons, often at the request of the appellant). An appeal may also have been decided at an earlier date by the First-tier Tribunal, only for the case to have gone on to the Upper Tribunal, to be returned once again to the First-tier for its final disposal.</p><p>HMCTS is very sensitive to the needs of people who may be affected by waiting times for Tribunal hearings. Tribunal staff and judicial office-holders, are trained accordingly, with HMCTS’s reasonable adjustments policy and practice applied where appropriate. Guidance on the policy is published on GOV.UK. If an expedited hearing is sought, or where the Tribunal identifies a case which might benefit from an expedited hearing, a judge or caseworker will make a decision on the issue, taking all the circumstances of the case into account.</p><p> </p>","Blackpool North and Cleveleys","Paul Maynard","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1123671/answer",,,,,,"2019-05-16T16:26:11.38Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1123671/answer","Biography information for Paul Maynard","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1123671/answer",,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-04-29","Social Security Benefits: Appeals","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many Social Security and Child Support Tribunal appeals have taken longer than 52 weeks for a determination, in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Grahame Morris","Easington","Grahame Morris","248645"
