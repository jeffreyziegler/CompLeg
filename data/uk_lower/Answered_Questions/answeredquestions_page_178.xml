The Taskforce’s attendees included representatives from leading business bodies, the construction trade sector, unions, banks and government. This has already led to useful collaborations, in particular in relation to ensuring firms and employees have access to support from Government and the banks.</p><p>I have also met several times with leading business and construction trade bodies, representing Carillion’s sub-contractors, to understand the impact of Carillion’s insolvency on the supply chain, and agree actions that could be taken to mitigate this. It is our intention to continue to meet regularly with this group on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Following the Secretary of State and my meeting with the banks on Wednesday 17<sup>th</sup> January, they made public commitments to provide support to SMEs affected and are contacting customers and, where appropriate, are putting in place emergency measures, including overdraft extensions, payment holidays and fee waivers to ensure those facing short term issues can be helped to stay on track.

Through this collaboration the UK government and the banks can continue to support small businesses with the appropriate finance.</p><p>The Secretary of State has written to all accredited EFG lenders to draw their attention to this additional support, and expects them to ensure that they are actively engaging with SME businesses so they can give them the support they need.

TfN has carried out some additional work which suggests that a shorter tunnel beneath the most environmentally sensitive areas, combined with wider transport connectivity enhancements, could help to overcome these issues and provide enhanced access to the Peak District National Park. Further work has been commissioned jointly by TfN and the Department to explore this option in more detail, and is currently expected to report late this year or early in 2019.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, the Government’s Road Investment Strategy sets out a package of measures to improve the route between Sheffield and Manchester.

In Improving Lives: The Future of Work, Health and Disability, we published our analysis of Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates that working-age disabled people with a reported main health condition of a learning difficulty (including people with a learning disability) have an employment rate of 24%.</p><p> </p><p>Making a step change in the life chances of people with learning difficulties, and learning disabilities, is a cross-Government priority. Improving Lives describes the measures we have taken so far and lays out our strategy for the future, including improvements to apprenticeships, education and employment support. The details may be read here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-lives-the-future-of-work-health-and-disability" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-lives-the-future-of-work-health-and-disability</a></p><p>Many leading employers do already create inclusive, healthy workplaces where people can thrive, and our vision is for this to become normal practice for all employers.</p><p>When employers sign up as Disability Confident they are asked to make specific meaningful offers of opportunities for disabled people such as jobs, apprenticeships, internships, and work experience opportunities. 5,550 businesses are currently signed up to Disability Confident, and this number is growing rapidly.</p><p>Access to Work provides practical and financial support for the additional costs faced by individuals whose health or disability affects the way they do their job. Access to Work has a Hidden Impairment Specialist Team which specialises in supporting people with learning difficulties, mental health conditions, learning disabilities and other less visible disabilities.</p>","Truro and Falmouth","Sarah Newton",,"2018-02-09T14:43:37.167Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/837603/answer","Biography information for Sarah Newton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/837603/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/837603/answer",,,,,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-02-05","Employment: Learning Disability","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment she has made of the adequacy of support made available by employers for workers with learning difficulties.","false","Biography information for Paul Blomfield","Sheffield Central","Paul Blomfield","126722"

These include:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Transport for London attribute the fall in bus patronage in London in the last three consecutive years to increased congestion and road works which has affected bus performance by reducing average bus speeds. This may also result in people switching to other modes of transport such as light rail.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Car ownership: Household car ownership remains high and is likely to have contributed to falling bus patronage. Data from the National Travel Survey (NTS) shows that 77% of households in England owned at least one car or van in 2016, up from 75% in 2010.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Online shopping: The growth in online shopping in recent years may have led to a fall in people using the bus for shopping trips.

The critical factors include the efficiency of the EfW plant; the volume and efficiency of landfill gas collection; the carbon intensity of electricity production offset by EfW and the proportions of the biogenic and fossil-derived content of residual waste. The study notes that, reducing the proportion of fossil-derived materials such as plastics going to EfW through actions such as increased recycling can improve its environmental performance relative to landfill in terms of carbon.</p><p> </p><p>The study also found that, under the current waste composition, landfill would only be environmentally preferable to EfW if the EfW plant had a net electrical efficiency of 11.7%.</p><p> </p><p>As set out in Defra’s 2013 paper on incineration of municipal solid waste, the typical net electrical efficiency of an incinerator only recovering electricity is 27%, further increasing with the utilisation of heat.

Local housing authorities already have strong powers under the Housing Act 2004 to require that landlords make necessary improvements to a property. Where a property contains potentially serious risks to the health and safety of the occupants, the local housing authority must take enforcement action.</p><p>The Housing and Planning Act 2016 introduced a range of further measures to strengthen local housing authority powers to tackle rogue landlords and drive up standards. In April 2017, we introduced civil penalties of up to £30,000 as an alternative to prosecution and extended Rent Repayment Orders, which require a landlord to repay a specified amount of rent to a local housing authority and/or tenant, to cover illegal eviction and failure to comply with a statutory notice. We intend to introduce a system of banning the most serious and prolific offenders from renting properties, as well as a database of rogue landlords and lettings agents to help local housing authorities with their housing standards enforcement work, in April 2018. These new powers will give local housing authorities the tools they need to crack down on rogue landlords who disregard the law and take advantage of tenants in the private rented sector.</p><p>Ultimately local housing authorities are responsible for taking enforcement action against rogue landlords. Our 'How to Rent' and 'How to rent a safe home' guides provide information for tenants on their rights and responsibilities and signpost them to their local housing authority for further information should there be a problem with their rented property. The Department will also be publishing further guidance for local housing authorities on the powers in the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which will encourage local housing authorities to publicise successful prosecutions locally and to make information on banned landlords available on request by a tenant. The guidance will be available on Gov.uk by April 2018.</p>",,"Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth",,"2018-02-14T16:15:34.897Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834728/answer","Biography information for Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834728/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834728/answer",,,,,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2018-02-01","Private Rented Housing: Standards","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government, following reports of poor standards of private rental accommodation, what remedial measures they are taking in conjunction with local and national housing agencies; and how those measures will be publicised.","false","Biography information for Lord Hunt of Chesterton",,"Lord Hunt of Chesterton","HL5328"
