"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604760","Department for Education","false","2016-10-26","<p>Estimating the average cost to a local authority of placing a child in the care system is complicated by a number of issues. For example, the costs relating to a particular child are determined by the length of time that they remain looked after. This will be, in part, determined by age on entry. Evidence shows that, proportionally, the number of children starting to be looked after aged 16 and over has been increasing in recent years: 16 percent of all children who started to be looked after during the year ending 31 March 2015 were aged 16 or over. For the year ending 31 March 2016, the proportion was 18 percent.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Costs also vary across placement types. Evidence shows that the average costs per resident week for a local authority care home for children are around £3,000.<sup>2</sup> The cost of foster care for children is estimated at around £600 per child per week on average.</p><p>Local authorities are required to submit annual budget and outturn statements about their spending on children’s services to the Secretary of State for Education.</p><p>The most recent annual outturn figures can be found at:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-outturn-2014-to-2015-data" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-outturn-2014-to-2015-data</a></p><p>Total local authority expenditure on looked after children is broken down across a number of areas including, for example, total expenditure on residential care, fostering services, and leaving care support services.</p><p>This information can be combined with information on the numbers of looked after children in each local authority to gain insight into average local authority expenditure per looked after child. Table LAA1 of the “Children Looked After in England including adoption” Statistical First Release shows the number of looked after children at 31 March each year by local authority.

Professor Briggs then visited every trust in England to discuss their data in order to reflect on variation in clinical practice, management approach and variations in procurement. The reports benchmark providers nationally and explore how clinical evidence is considered and informs practice. This is a highly detailed approach facilitating an extensive understanding of the links between practice, outcome and cost drivers, which in turn enabled a series of recommendations to be developed benefitting quality of care and finances of both providers and commissioners. Following the provider level reports and visits, a national report and recommendations were produced.

This investment is needed to meet the ever increasing demand for passenger journeys into London, of which there are currently about 4 billion every year.</p><p> </p><p>More widely, care needs to be taken in interpreting regional spend figures. Expenditure is usually allocated between regions on the basis of which regions benefit from the expenditure rather than on the basis of where the expenditure is made. However, it is not always possible to put the value of spending down to certain parts of the country and this is particularly a problem for spending on the rail network. Though the Department does try to distribute rail funding across the regions, allocations are inevitably fairly imprecise.</p><p> </p><p>It is also important to note that expenditure comparisons on a ‘per-head’ basis (using resident populations) can present a skewed picture of the distribution of benefits for transport generally, and for transport in London particularly. This is because the transport networks in London are routinely used by a very large number of other regions’ residents.</p><p> </p><p>Even allowing for these points, one would also expect London’s ‘per head’ transport expenditure to be higher than the national average. London provides key international travel gateways for the whole of the country. London is also densely populated with different public transport and infrastructure demands – for example London residents comprise around 15% of the population of England, but London accounts for almost two-thirds of rail journeys in Great Britain.</p><p> </p><p>The equivalent information is unavailable at a sub-region level, therefore cannot be provided as per parts (a) and (b) of the request.</p>","Blackpool North and Cleveleys","Paul Maynard",,"2016-10-25T14:08:34.247Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604941/answer","Biography information for Paul Maynard","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604941/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604941/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2016-10-18","Railways: Expenditure","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, how much has been spent from the public purse on rail services per capita in (a) Birmingham, (b) the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority, formerly Centro and (c) each region of England from 2009-10 to the most recent financial year for which information is available.","false","Biography information for Mr Khalid Mahmood","Birmingham, Perry Barr","Mr Khalid Mahmood","49232"
