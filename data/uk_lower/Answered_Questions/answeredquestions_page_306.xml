"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604760","Department for Education","false","2016-10-26","<p>Estimating the average cost to a local authority of placing a child in the care system is complicated by a number of issues. For example, the costs relating to a particular child are determined by the length of time that they remain looked after. This will be, in part, determined by age on entry. Evidence shows that, proportionally, the number of children starting to be looked after aged 16 and over has been increasing in recent years: 16 percent of all children who started to be looked after during the year ending 31 March 2015 were aged 16 or over. For the year ending 31 March 2016, the proportion was 18 percent.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Costs also vary across placement types. Evidence shows that the average costs per resident week for a local authority care home for children are around Â£3,000.<sup>2</sup> The cost of foster care for children is estimated at around Â£600 per child per week on average.</p><p>Local authorities are required to submit annual budget and outturn statements about their spending on childrenâs services to the Secretary of State for Education.</p><p>The most recent annual outturn figures can be found at:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-outturn-2014-to-2015-data" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-outturn-2014-to-2015-data</a></p><p>Total local authority expenditure on looked after children is broken down across a number of areas including, for example, total expenditure on residential care, fostering services, and leaving care support services.</p><p>This information can be combined with information on the numbers of looked after children in each local authority to gain insight into average local authority expenditure per looked after child. Table LAA1 of the âChildren Looked After in England including adoptionâ Statistical First Release shows the number of looked after children at 31 March each year by local authority.

The reports benchmark providers nationally and explore how clinical evidence is considered and informs practice.

The Government is giving local authorities access to up to Â£3.5 billion of new support for social care by 2019/20. This should mean local government has access to the funding to increase social care spending in real terms by the end of the Parliament. This will support councils to continue to focus on core services and to pay fees which reflect provider costs including the National Living Wage.</p><p> </p><p>The spending took into account a range of financial and economic factors, including projections and data on the National Living Wage from the Office of Budget Responsibility and Skills for Care.</p><p> </p><p>The National Living Wage is an important step in rewarding the valuable contribution made by care workers, who often fall into the lowest earning occupations. Out of an estimated 1.16 million workers in adult social care in England, up to 900,000 people are expected to benefit.</p><p> </p><p>Under the Care Act 2014, local authorities must have regard to fostering an effective workforce with the appropriate capabilities when shaping their local markets. The Act and its statutory guidance make clear that prices and fee rates agreed with providers must reflect these new duties, including the National Living Wage. The Department continues to monitor the whole of the market of care providers and engage with the sector to better understand the challenges they face and support local authorities who purchase services.</p>","Warrington South","David Mowat","49212 ; 49299","2016-10-20T14:54:47.713Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604871/answer","Biography information for David Mowat","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604871/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/604871/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-10-18","Care Homes: Living Wage","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what assessment he has made of the future viability of care providers after the introduction of the national living wage.","false","Biography information for Ian Austin","Dudley North","Ian Austin","49214"

This investment is needed to meet the ever increasing demand for passenger journeys into London, of which there are currently about 4 billion every year.</p><p> </p><p>More widely, care needs to be taken in interpreting regional spend figures. Expenditure is usually allocated between regions on the basis of which regions benefit from the expenditure rather than on the basis of where the expenditure is made.
