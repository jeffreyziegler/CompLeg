HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely, apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information. Note that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March, e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.</p><p> </p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2015-06-22T14:12:50.58Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381512/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381512/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381512/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-06-16","Eating Disorders","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what estimate his Department has made of the number of people who have an eating disorder in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Luciana Berger","Liverpool, Wavertree","Luciana Berger","2736"

NHS England has committed £6 million to support six trials of more precise stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and a further £15 million over three years to evaluate and treat patients with SABR.

Infrastructure has been seriously damaged while the depletion of state resources threatens the Libyan economy.

Criminal gangs are exploiting the security void to smuggle and traffic increasing numbers of refugees and migrants through Libya, leading to continuing loss of lives at sea.</p><p>A united Libyan government is urgently needed in order to address these challenges. That is why the UK welcomed the latest round of talks in Morocco and Berlin on 8 and 10 June respectively on the fourth draft Libyan political agreement, led by UN Special Representative of the Secretary General Leon.

The first national lung cancer campaign led to 700 extra diagnoses and 300 more surgeries during the time of the campaign. NHS England has launched a major early diagnosis programme (Accelerate, Co-ordinate, Evaluate – ACE), working jointly with Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support to test new innovative approaches to identifying cancer more quickly. We are also on track to have all bowel scope screening centres open by December 2016.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have also made major investments in innovative radiotherapy.

This is ahead of the target of 24%, and up from 5% in 2010. NHS England has committed £6 million to support six trials of more precise stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and a further £15 million over three years to evaluate and treat patients with SABR. We have also pledged £250 million for two proton beam therapy (PBT) centres at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which will be operational by 2018.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Over 1.5 million people were urgently referred to a specialist for suspected cancer in 2014-15, an increase of over 645,000 or 71% compared to 2009-10, and a record of nearly 273,000 patients began treatment for cancer, an increase of over 39,000 or 17% compared to 2009-10. In addition 19 million diagnostic tests were carried out, an increase of nearly 4.7 million or nearly 33% compared to 2009-10.
