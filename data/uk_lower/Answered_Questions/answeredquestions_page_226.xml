OSJA assessments are carried out before assistance is rendered and evaluates the risk of any training provided being used in a way that is not in line with human rights and British values. As the Foreign Secretary stated in his written ministerial statement on 26 January 2017 (HCWS441), the new OSJA process remains the most comprehensive and demanding tool of its type anywhere in the world.</p><p> </p><p>As the lead Department for OSJA policy, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) engaged with a number of human rights organisations (including members of the Foreign Secretary’s Advisory Groups on Human Rights) as part of the recent revision of the OSJA guidance and will continue to do so with regard to its implementation. The FCO will include information on the steps taken to implement OSJA across Government when it publishes its Annual Human Rights Report.</p><p> </p><p>Defence personnel consider the OSJA guidance for all new proposed assistance and extensions to existing assistance, and where a substantial change in circumstances has significantly altered the risk for existing assistance. The guidance is therefore considered in any country where assistance is planned. Authority for activity underpinned by OSJA assessments is made at different levels according to the risk, from personnel in-country to Ministers in Departments of State. The Ministry of Defence does not hold data covering all Defence OSJA assessments made in the last three calendar years.</p><p> </p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster","105778 ; 105780 ; 105785 ; 105786 ; 105791","2017-10-16T15:18:26.95Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/766075/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/766075/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/766075/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2017-10-06","International Assistance: Security","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, for which countries his Department has made Overseas Security and Justice Assistance assessments in the last three years.","false","Biography information for Stephen Gethins","North East Fife","Stephen Gethins","105768"

Alongside a significant reduction in commercial landings, these measures are aimed at reducing mortality while the stock recovers, in order to secure the long term future of bass fisheries. The EU measures from 2015 onwards were also applied to the recreational sector as scientific advice in 2014 indicated on the basis of earlier angling surveys that up to 25% of total bass removals were estimated at that time to be accounted for by bass anglers.</p><p>A specific cost estimate of the effects of the EU bass recovery measures on the recreational sector by limiting retention of catch by anglers has not been conducted. Arriving at a reliable assessment, particularly given that catch and release activity has not been restricted, would be challenging.
