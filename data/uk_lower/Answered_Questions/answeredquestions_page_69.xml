Out of the 11 areas assessed, the UK received the highest possible rating in 4 and the second highest rating in a further 4.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The strong assessment of the UK’s system reflects the UK’s commitment to tackling illicit finance – as reflected through recent reforms such as the establishment of the National Economic Crime Centre, the establishment of the Office for Professional Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS) within the Financial Conduct Authority, the new measures introduced in the Criminal Finances Act 2017, and the implementation of the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.</p><p> </p><p>In January, the Chancellor and Home Secretary launched the Economic Crime Strategic Board which will work with senior figures from the public and private sectors to tackle economic crime. The Board, which will meet twice a year, will set priorities, direct resources and scrutinise performance against the economic crime threat. It is through the work of this Board, and the ongoing Treasury and Home Office-led economic crime reform programme, that the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations will be addressed.</p><p> </p><p>On 13 February, I co-chaired an AML/CFT Supervision roundtable with the Minister of State for Security &amp; Economic Crime, with attendance from across the professional body supervision regime. This provided an important opportunity to emphasise the commitment of government to tackling illicit finance in the accountancy and legal sectors, to reaffirm my support for OPBAS in raising supervision standards and to make clear to attendees their responsibility to address the recommendations made by FATF during their review of the UK’s AML/CFT regime.</p><p> </p><p>There is work already in train to address some of the recommendations. For example, the government is already committed to:</p><ul><li><p>Reforming the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) regime, to further improve the use of financial intelligence in the UK</p></li><li><p>Regulating virtual currencies for AML/CTF purposes by the end of 2019, to tackle emerging risks in the sector</p></li><li><p>Taking appropriate action on mitigating the threats posed by limited partnerships, on which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published proposals in December 2018</p></li><li><p>A broader package of reforms to Companies House which will be consulted on later this year, and</p></li><li><p>Strengthening the AML supervisory regime through the work of the OPBAS.</p></li></ul>","Salisbury","John Glen",,"2019-02-19T14:27:16.51Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1061148/answer","Biography information for John Glen","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1061148/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1061148/answer",,,,,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2019-02-14","Money Laundering","1","House of Commons","To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what steps his Department is taking to implement the recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force in its recent assessment of the UK's anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing regime.","false","Biography information for Anneliese Dodds","Oxford East","Anneliese Dodds","221812"

Anybody who is worried about being able to pay what they owe should get in touch with HMRC as soon as possible. They have a number of ways to help those who are genuinely unable to make a full payment of tax on time, for example, by arranging payments by instalments. HMRC’s Debt Management team are also trained to identify customers who are vulnerable and will refer them to HMRC’s specialist “Needs enhanced support” team. They will tailor their support to meet the needs of the individual.</p><p> </p><p>DR schemes are contrived arrangements that pay loans in place of ordinary remuneration with the sole purpose of avoiding income tax and National Insurance contributions.</p><p> </p><p>Since the announcement of the 2019 loan charge at Budget 2016, HMRC has now agreed settlements on disguised remuneration schemes with employers and individuals totalling over £1 billion. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) liabilities fall on the employer in the first instance. The charge on DR loans does not change this principle and the employee will only be liable where the amount cannot reasonably be collected from the employer, such as where the employer is offshore or no longer exists. Around 85% of the settlement yield since 2016 is from employers, with less than 15% from individuals.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC is working hard to help individuals get out of avoidance for good and offer manageable and sustainable payment plans wherever possible. It carefully considers each case and there is no maximum limit on how long a customer can be given to pay what they owe. HMRC considers a customer’s ability to pay on a case by case basis and decisions are based on each individual’s personal circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has simplified the process for those who want to settle their use of DR schemes before the loan charge arises. DR scheme users who currently have an income of less than £50,000 and are no longer engaging in tax avoidance can automatically agree a payment plan of up to five years without the need to give HMRC detailed information about their income and assets. This arrangement has been extended to 7 years for scheme users who have an income of less than £30,000.</p><p> </p><p>Anybody who is worried about being able to pay what they owe should get in touch with HMRC as soon as possible.
