"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391000","Department for Education","false","2015-07-23","<p>We have changed the law to improve how young carers and their families are identified and supported. Changes introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014 consolidate and simplify the legislation relating to young carers’ assessments, making rights and duties clearer to both young people and practitioners. They extend the right to an assessment of needs to all young carers, regardless of who they care for or what type of care they provide. They make it clear to local authorities that they must carry out an assessment of a young carer’s needs for support on request or on the appearance of need. These new duties came into effect in April 2015.</p><p> </p><p>We know that schools play a very important part in identifying pupils who are young carers and in offering them appropriate support. The Department for Educaton has worked with the Children’s Society and the Carers Trust since 2011 to share existing tools and good practice. Since 2011 we have provided grant funding and contracts worth over £3.4m to help support schools and local authorities in the identification and support of young carers. This includes over £500,000 we are providing to Carers Trust in 2015-16 to work with local authorities to develop models for identification, assessment and support services which specifically address the needs of young carers. DfE are also providing over £110,000 of grant-funding to Suffolk Family Carers to run a local project which aims to raise awareness of young carers amongst teachers, non-teaching staff and school nurses, supporting Suffolk County Council’s strategy on young carers. The Department of Health is also training school nurses to be champions for young carers. They will speak up on their behalf and help head teachers and governors decide how best to support them at school.</p><p> </p><p>I am also familiar with and welcome two initiatives led by the voluntary sector. The Big Lottery Fund are financing The Children’s Society’s “Young Carers in Focus” programme and The Queen’s Trust, too, are funding the Carers Trust to develop and test best practice on young carer support in schools. We are also grateful to the National Governors’ Association and Ofsted for their help in raising awareness of the impact of caring on school attendance and attainment and sharing resources amongst governors and inspectors.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We will continue to encourage schools to use the resources that are already freely available to them and to make links to their local young carers support groups.</p><p> </p><p>We recognise that consistent identification of young carers remains challenging. DfE has commissioned a research study into the lives of young carers in England which aims to provide firmer information on the numbers and needs of young carers and their families. The research will be completed in spring 2016.</p><p> </p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391000/answer",,,,,,"2015-07-23T10:16:37.57Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391000/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391000/answer",,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2015-07-17","Carers: Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what recent steps her Department has taken to (a) identify and (b) support young carers.","false","Biography information for Mr Jamie Reed","Copeland","Mr Jamie Reed","7795"

Because of the gradual progression of the condition, the variety of symptoms, which are shared with a range of other conditions, diagnosis at early onset can be challenging.</p><p>To support the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) has published <em>Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Cobalamin and Folate disorders,</em> which sets out that cobalamin status is the recommended first line diagnostic test. However, the guidance states that there is no gold standard test for the condition and makes it clear that the clinical picture of a patient is the most important factor in assessing the significance of the test results. This means clinicians should take into account all of the symptoms the patent is experiencing, their medical history, age and other relevant factors when considering the implications of a patient’s cobalamin status. The BCSH guidance highlights the risk of neurological impairment if treatment is delayed.</p><p><br /> The BCSH operates independently of Department and NHS England and produces evidence based guidelines for both clinical and laboratory haematologists on the diagnosis and treatment of haematological disease, drawing on the advice of expert consultants and clinical scientists practicing in the United Kingdom. It would be for the BCSH, not the Department, to consider whether any adjustments to current best practice in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pernicious anaemia were needed, including whether any new or additional tests were appropriate.

Pernicious anaemia develops gradually, and can cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, lethargy, feeling faint and headaches, which vary from patient to patient. Because of the gradual progression of the condition, the variety of symptoms, which are shared with a range of other conditions, diagnosis at early onset can be challenging.</p><p>To support the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) has published <em>Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Cobalamin and Folate disorders,</em> which sets out that cobalamin status is the recommended first line diagnostic test. However, the guidance states that there is no gold standard test for the condition and makes it clear that the clinical picture of a patient is the most important factor in assessing the significance of the test results. This means clinicians should take into account all of the symptoms the patent is experiencing, their medical history, age and other relevant factors when considering the implications of a patient’s cobalamin status. The BCSH guidance highlights the risk of neurological impairment if treatment is delayed.</p><p><br /> The BCSH operates independently of Department and NHS England and produces evidence based guidelines for both clinical and laboratory haematologists on the diagnosis and treatment of haematological disease, drawing on the advice of expert consultants and clinical scientists practicing in the United Kingdom. It would be for the BCSH, not the Department, to consider whether any adjustments to current best practice in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pernicious anaemia were needed, including whether any new or additional tests were appropriate. A copy of the BCSH guidance document <del class="ministerial">has already been placed in the Library and</del> is attached.</p><p><br /> More general clinical guidance on the diagnosis and management of pernicious anaemia can also be found on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Knowledge Summaries website. This is a freely accessible online resource that covers the causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of pernicious anaemia, as well as potential complications of the condition. In addition to this, NHS Choices provides similar, though less technical, information on pernicious anaemia for the public.</p>",,"Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/390600/answer","colbalamin and folate disorders.pdf","colbalamin and folate disorders.pdf","BCSH Guidelines pernicious anaemia","BCSH Guidelines pernicious anaemia",,"2015-07-24T13:21:19.357Z","2015-10-14T11:21:19.847Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/390600/answer","Biography information for Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/390600/answer","Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/390600/answer/previousversion/17460","Biography information for Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/390600/answer/previousversion/17460","colbalamin and folate disorders.pdf","BCSH Guidelines pernicious anaemia","17","Health","Health","2015-07-16","Anaemia","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government how they propose to alert medical practitioners to the severe and irreversible nerve damage that can occur when pernicious anaemia is misdiagnosed.","false","Biography information for The Countess of Mar",,"The Countess of Mar","HL1540"
