It went on to say that:</p><p> </p><p>“The Department supports the intent behind this recommendation and is considering the benefits of developing a coherent cross-departmental programme in due course. However, doing so would require considerable time and resource to do it justice and our focus at present is on a wide range of delivery and policy priorities which we will set out briefly here. NHS England set out a clear plan for improvements in the NHS in the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health Implementation Plan, building upon the recommendations of Future in Mind to improve children and young people’s mental health. The Department remains committed to this plan and has since made commitments to go significantly further, particularly in relation to mental health and education via Transforming Children and Young People’s Mental Health Provision: a Green Paper, jointly published with the Department for Education in December 2017, and there are a wide range of important new commitments outlined in the NHS Long Term Plan. The Department is also taking forward significant work bilaterally with several other government departments including the Ministry of Justice on the independent review of the Mental Health Act, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on social media and a cross-government strategy on suicide prevention which was published 22 January 2019.</p><p> </p><p>Both the children and young people’s mental health Green Paper and Future in Mind identified the need for cross-organisational working. As a result of Future in Mind, since 2015, each Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) area across England worked with partners in Children’s Services, the voluntary sector, providers and children, young people and parents to develop Local Transformation Plans, setting out how local agencies will work together to improve children and young people’s mental health across the full spectrum of need. Local Transformation Plans are refreshed annually and report into local governance structures including Health and Wellbeing Boards. The Government convenes regular cross-Whitehall Inter-Ministerial Groups to ensure senior focus on mental health in policies across Government.”</p><p> </p><p>The Government response is available at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/public-accounts/Correspondence/2017-19/Treasury%20MInutes%20Government_Response_Web.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/public-accounts/Correspondence/2017-19/Treasury%20MInutes%20Government_Response_Web.pdf#page=9</a></p>","Thurrock","Jackie Doyle-Price",,"2019-06-20T16:27:36.303Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132606/answer","Biography information for Jackie Doyle-Price","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132606/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132606/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-06-17","Mental Health Services: Children and Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, for what reason his Department disagreed with the Public Accounts Committee in their report into mental health services for children and young people, published on 11 January 2019, that his Department should co-operate with other Departments to tackle mental health issues in children and young people.","false","Biography information for Layla Moran","Oxford West and Abingdon","Layla Moran","265625"

However, where there is a safeguarding issue or an ongoing risk to children, proceedings can be brought in England and Wales against the individual, regardless of whether the local authorities have sought to bring such action.</p><p>Our network of tri-departmental Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Home Office and the Department For International Development Serious and Organised Crime Regional Coordinators, and National Crime Agency officers posted overseas, work closely with their host governments in the fight against all forms of organised crime, including child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA). The network's aim is to fuse and enhance the response to transnational serious and organised crime. The Government is also enhancing its understanding of the nature and impact of international illicit finance (including corruption), demonstrating the UK's global leadership in tackling it. We will engage with partner governments to build both the political will and the capability to tackle this threat.

The Government published the Immigration White Paper, outlining the future immigration system in December 2018 and is currently running an engagement programme with businesses and other stakeholders before publishing the Immigration Rules setting out the detail of the future system. In addition, since January 2018, the Government has implemented an extensive and wide-ranging package of changes to the immigration rules, aimed at supporting science, research and innovation including setting up a new Tier 5 (Government Authorised Exchange) Scheme to make it easier to sponsor the temporary movement of international researchers.</p><p>Business schools attract funding for research from a range of sources including Horizon 2020, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme.

In the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the extension period, the Government has confirmed that the funding commitments made under the guarantee and its extension still stand. Through these commitments, the Government will underwrite funding for all successful competitive eligible UK bids to Horizon 2020 that are submitted before the end of the Programme - including those involving UK business schools. This guarantee will apply for the lifetime of projects and will provide funding for UK participation in Horizon 2020.</p><p>Looking ahead, the Government would like the option to associate to the future excellence-based European research and innovation programmes, including Horizon Europe.

Any drawings from business to personal accounts or, where a claimant has incorporated their business, payment of salary from their company to their personal account, is disregarded in this calculation to avoid double counting.</p><p> </p><p>When a claim is made to Universal Credit the Department will, on the basis of the information provided by the claimant, assess whether the claimant may reasonably be expected to work. If a claimant is in a group expected to work, the number of hours they may be expected to work is a maximum of 35 but may be lower, for example to take account of caring responsibilities or a health condition.</p><p> </p><p>If a claimant is self-employed and in a group expected to work, the Department then considers a number of factors to establish whether someone is gainfully self-employed. A claimant is considered to be in gainful self-employment where all of the following apply:</p><p> </p><ul><li>the claimant is carrying on a trade, profession or vocation as their main employment</li><li>their earnings from that trade, profession or vocation are self-employed earnings</li><li>the trade, profession or vocation is organised, developed, regular and carried out in expectation of profit</li></ul><p> </p><p>If all of the above are satisfied, then the claimant is considered gainfully self-employed. A Minimum Income Floor (MIF) is calculated by multiplying the number of hours the gainfully self-employed claimant is expected to work by the relevant National Minimum Wage for their age, minus notional deductions for Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions. Gainfully self-employed claimants with a MIF applied to their claim are free from requirements to seek other work and are free to undertake those activities that they consider will maximise their profit including decisions about when and how to work most effectively.</p><p> </p><p>As we announced in the Autumn Budget 2018, we are extending the 12-month start-up period where claimants are exempt from the Minimum Income Floor to all gainfully self-employed claimants who are new to Universal Credit. This start-up period will provide time for self-employed claimants to establish and grow their business, or to adjust to Universal Credit.</p><p> </p><p>On average earnings from self-employment are lower than from employment and the self-employed make up a significant proportion of those in in-work poverty. The Government believes the MIF, by incentivising claimants to earn more from self-employment, or alternatively enter employment, offers the most effective way of tackling in-work poverty for the self-employed.</p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma","264731 ; 264733","2019-06-24T15:58:35.073Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132233/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132233/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132233/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2019-06-14","Universal Credit: Self-employed","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether her Department differentiates between annual turnover and salary when assessing the incomes of self-employed applicants of universal credit.","false","Biography information for Hywel Williams","Arfon","Hywel Williams","264734"

This will drive up standards in promoting student and staff mental health and wellbeing and it will invite universities to meet high standards of practice, including in areas such as leadership, early intervention and data collection.</p><p>On 5 June 2019, the Office for Students announced the award of almost £6 million of funding for 10 large-scale projects through a challenge competition, encouraging higher education providers to find new ways of combating student mental health issues. The projects involve over 60 different universities, colleges and other organisations including NHS services, the police and charities, together contributing matched-funding taking the investment up to £14.5 million. <br> <br> Higher education providers have legal responsibilities under the Equality Act (2010) to support students, including those with mental health conditions.

To ensure the increase in business rates retention is fiscally neutral, some existing grants (including the Rural Services Delivery Grant) will be devolved to local authorities so that these responsibilities are funded through retained business rates. We recognise that some redistribution of business rates between authorities will continue to be necessary to ensure that no council loses out if it is unable to collect enough business rates locally to meet its needs. We are therefore undertaking a review of local authorities’ relative needs and resources to determine the basis on which redistribution will take place in the new system.</p><p>The review of relative needs and resources will set fresh baseline funding levels for councils in England, and we are working closely with local government representatives and others to examine all of the available evidence for the costs faced by authorities, including how geographical features such as rurality and density affect the cost of delivering services across the country, and how to account for these in a robust manner. In December 2018 we published a consultation paper that set out a proposed ‘Area Cost Adjustment’ methodology to account for these factors. This included consideration of how levels of 'accessibility' and 'remoteness' - the impact of journey times on labour and procurement costs - might account for the additional costs associated with sparsity, isolation or market size. For example, local authorities with longer journey times from service points to households may have to pay their staff (e.g. on domiciliary care visits) for more hours in order to deliver an equivalent level of service.</p><p>In developing this innovative new approach, we have worked closely with both local government and other government departments, including the Department for Transport and DEFRA as champions for rural proofing. Our most recent consultation closed on 21 February and we are considering the many representations made in response, before taking further decisions on the shape of the review.</p>","Richmond (Yorks)","Rishi Sunak",,"2019-06-18T13:36:33.17Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132063/answer","Biography information for Rishi Sunak","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132063/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132063/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2019-06-13","Local Government Finance: Rural Areas","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, what plans he has to review the rural sparsity factor in the calculation of Government support for rural areas; and if he will ensure that changes can be incorporated within the delivery of the Rural Services Delivery Grant.","false","Biography information for Dr David Drew","Stroud","Dr David Drew","264312"

We take the mental health of prisoners extremely seriously, which is why we have increased the support available to vulnerable offenders, especially during the first 24 hours in custody. We are updating the mental health training for prison officers and so far over 24,000 new and existing prison staff have completed at least one module of the revised suicide and self-harm prevention training. HMPPS is working with NHS England and Public Health England to improve and redesign services for people in prison with mental health needs. This includes revising approaches to secure hospital transfers under section 47 and 48 of the Mental Health Act when a person needs to be in a hospital setting for their mental health assessment and treatment. HMPPS and NHS England have worked together to collect new evidence and have increased understanding of where transfers work well and how delays arise, identifying areas for improvement. NHS England are currently consulting on an updated version of DHSC’s good practice guidance on transfers and remissions, which will inform our approach. In addition, the independent review of the Mental Health Act, published in December 2018, made recommendations in relation to patients in the criminal justice system, which require detailed consideration in the context of transfers from prison to hospital and we will respond to these in due course. Officials in the Mental Health Casework Section (MHCS) in HMPPS issue transfer warrants on behalf of the Secretary of State. MHCS has an internal target to produce a transfer warrant within 24 hours of receipt of all necessary information. In the vast majority of cases (96%), transfer warrants are issued within 24 hours of MHCS receiving all necessary information. By holding partners to account where information is missing, MHCS has recently reduced the average time from initial notification to the issue of a warrant from 14 calendar days to 3 calendar days.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","Charnwood","Edward Argar",,"2019-06-21T13:49:22.497Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132147/answer","Biography information for Edward Argar","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132147/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1132147/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-06-13","Mentally Disordered Offenders: Prisoners' Transfers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what steps he is taking to reduce waiting times for the transfer of offenders to mental health hospitals under sections 47 and 48 of the Mental Health Act 1983.","false","Biography information for Mr Kevan Jones","North Durham","Mr Kevan Jones","264365"

As such, we cannot tell whether an offender is still subject to a community order at the time of their reoffence. Please see the available data in the table provided. There is persuasive evidence showing community sentences, in certain circumstances, are more effective than short custodial sentences in reducing reoffending. The MoJ study ‘The impact of short custodial sentences, community orders and suspended sentence orders on re-offending’ published in 2015 involved around 350,000 sentencing occasions over 4 years and used 130 different variables to construct matched groups of offenders and examine the effect of short sentences relative to community sentences. This study found a reduction of around 3 percentage points in proven reoffences if offenders receiving sentences of less than 12 months were to get a community order instead. This is statistically significant and equates to around 30,000 proven reoffences in total over a one-year period. This means fewer victims of crime. Unless we tackle the underlying causes of offending, we cannot protect the public from being victims of crime. Effective community orders can address offenders’ behaviour, answer their mental health and alcohol or drug misuse needs, and provide reparation for the benefit of the wider community.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","South Swindon","Robert Buckland",,"2019-06-17T16:53:27.17Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1131654/answer","Biography information for Robert Buckland","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1131654/answer","Copy of PQ 263837.xlsx","Copy of PQ 263837.xlsx","Table","Table","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1131654/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-06-12","Reoffenders: Community Orders","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, pursuant to the Answer of 10 April to Question 239207 on the Answer of 9 May to Question 246971, how many offenders re-offended while being the subject of a community order; and how many offences of each type were committed by those offenders in each year since 2007.","false","Biography information for Neil O'Brien","Harborough","Neil O'Brien","263837"
