We are also testing supported work experience for young disabled people aged 18-24 flowing into the Work-Related Activities Group of Employment Support Allowance or the Universal Credit equivalent. Those young people with little or no work experience will be offered a supported work experience placement with an employer, to help them gain confidence and encourage them to look for work. Although the proof of concept is pan-disability we expect a significant proportion of those taking part to have a learning disability.</p><p> </p><p>Eligibility to specialist employment support programmes such as Work Choice (WC) and Specialist Employability Support (SES) is not benefit or disability specific, but does include claimants who are on Jobseeker's Allowance and who have a learning disability. Of all those to have who started Work Choice, 56% were claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance and almost a quarter had a mild learning disability/moderate to severe learning disability.</p><p> </p><p>We are promoting Disability Confident among employers, including the benefits to business of employing people with learning disabilities. Almost 5,000 employers have now signed up to be Disability Confident, including all Government Departments. Access to Work is also available to help people with learning disabilities into employment, such as funding for a Job Coach to support a person’s induction and provide on-site training in a new job.</p><p> </p><p>DWP publishes online guidance for employing people with health conditions and disabilities, including learning disabilities. It provides information to help employers increase their understanding of disability and enable them to recruit and support disabled people and those with long term health conditions in work. The Disability Confident scheme provides links to a range of guidance and other resources to enable employers to become more confident when recruiting and retaining disabled people. The guidance can be accessed at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employing-disabled-people-and-people-with-health-conditions/employing-disabled-people-and-people-with-health-conditions" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employing-disabled-people-and-people-with-health-conditions/employing-disabled-people-and-people-with-health-conditions</a></p><p> </p><p>The Green Paper Improving Lives; the Work, Health and Disability Green Paper, asked questions about how we better support people into employment and highlighted learning disabilities as an area for further discussion.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756129","Department for Work and Pensions","false","2017-09-11","<p>By design, Universal Credit is a much simpler system than that it replaces. It is easier for claimants to understand their entitlements and easier to administer. Nonetheless, we recognise that it represents a significant change for claimants, and some will find it challenging. That is why Universal Credit has an unprecedented level of personalised support for each claimant and there are a number of safeguards to support them, especially at the start of the claim. For example advances are available to help people manage until their first payment, this can amount to 50% of their indicative award and is payable straight away.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, ‘Universal Support’ is being rolled out alongside Universal Credit and is being delivered via a framework approach to allow third sector organisations and Local Authorities to work with jobcentres to deliver the support needed in their local community. The aim is for claimants to receive integrated tailored support journeys and partners can achieve this through best use of local resources.</p><p> </p><p>Part of this offer is budgeting support to help claimants manage their money on a monthly basis, pay bills on time and take responsibility for housing costs. Advice is offered by external organisations with the relevant expertise, online, by phone or face-to-face. Where claimants need help making a claim online, ‘assisted digital’ support is available as part of the package, alongside telephone and face to face support. And for claimants who cannot manage their money on a monthly basis alternative payment arrangements are available. These can include payment of rent direct to a landlord, paying Universal Credit more frequently or splitting the payment between members of the household.</p><p> </p><p>When debt problems are identified then the claimant can be referred on or signposted to other more specialised debt support services</p>","East Hampshire","Damian Hinds","7614 ; 7615","2017-09-11T16:48:48.593Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756129/answer","Biography information for Mr Damian Hinds","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756129/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756129/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2017-09-04","Universal Credit","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps he is taking to help universal credit claimants avoid getting into debt.","false","Biography information for Mike Kane","Wythenshawe and Sale East","Mike Kane","7441"

As capacity with the provider has increased, this has enabled us to undertake assessments on a greater range of cases, including more reassessment cases and more cases which require a face-to-face assessment. This has changed the case mix and we are seeing more fit-for-work and work-related activity group decisions. Fit-for-work decisions are more likely to be appealed.

The CPS definition of rape covers any case where the following offences were considered pre-charge or were subsequently charged:</p><ul><li>Rape: Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956</li><li>Sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13: Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956</li><li>Rape: Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003</li><li>Rape of a child under 13: Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003</li><li>Sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder impeding choice: Section 30(3) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003</li><li>An attempt to commit any of the above offences under the Criminal Attempts Act 1981</li><li>Incitement or conspiracy to commit any of the above offences.</li></ul><p>No separate record of the shortest or longest time from the initial request from the police to the decision to charge is maintained on the CMS, nor is any record collated showing the average number of days taken when the outcome of the charging decision is not to prosecute or any other outcome.</p><p>Rape and serious sexual offences (RASSO) investigations can be highly complex in nature and typically involve the review of a large quantity of evidence. In the vast majority of cases suspects are on police bail prior to a charging decision being made by the CPS and where the police seek a charging decision in such circumstances the CPS cannot authorise charges until the Full Code Test set out in the Code is met. The timeliness of a charging decision is determined by two key factors: how quickly the police can complete the necessary enquiries; and how quickly the CPS can then review the evidence provided by the police and finalise the charging decision.</p><p>The CPS recognises the distress caused to both complainants and defendants by delays in the charging process and we are committed to improving the timeliness of charging decisions. One of the most significant steps that the CPS has taken in this regard has been to substantially increase the resourcing allocated to the specialist RASSO units around the country which prosecute these cases. Between July 2015 and May 2017 the number of RASSO prosecutors available to make charging decisions rose from 138 to 197. This increased resourcing has contributed to an improvement in the timeliness of charging decisions. The number of RASSO cases awaiting CPS charging advice for between 28 days and 3 months fell by over 46% between March 2016 and March 2017 from 489 to 263 cases. Latest provisional data for July indicates the numbers have fallen still further to less than 130.</p><p>The CPS is committed to achieving further improvements in timeliness and in May 2017 the RASSO Service Standards were launched. These Standards set out best practice for the management of pre-charge RASSO bail cases between CPS areas and their local police partners. The Standards provide a commitment on the part of the CPS to provide a review of a case within 28 days of submission from the police and sets out an escalation procedure for police colleagues to follow when this target is not met. The Standards also require CPS staff to be actively involved in securing updates from investigating officers where there are significant delays in the police investigation of RASSO cases.</p>","Kenilworth and Southam","Jeremy Wright",,"2017-09-19T14:33:50.607Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756377/answer","Biography information for Jeremy Wright","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756377/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756377/answer",,,,,"88","Attorney General","Attorney General","2017-09-04","Rape: Prosecutions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Attorney General, how many cases of alleged rape under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 were referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) by police in each year since 2009-10; on how many occasions the CPS pressed charges for those cases in each of those years; and what the (a) average, (b) shortest and (c) longest period of time between referral and charging was for cases which (i) did and (ii) did not lead to CPS charges in each of those years.","false","Biography information for Diana Johnson","Kingston upon Hull North","Diana Johnson","8464"
