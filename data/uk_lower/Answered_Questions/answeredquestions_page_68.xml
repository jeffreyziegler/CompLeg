Children of lone parent workless families are around 4 times more likely to be in poverty than those where their parent works full time. There are now over 1.2 million lone parents in work and this Government has introduced a number of changes to help lone parents address the challenges they face. Working parents on Universal Credit can have up to 85% of their childcare costs reimbursed – worth up to £1,108 per month for someone with two or more children. We have also introduced additional flexibility on support for up front childcare costs, increased work allowances and doubled free childcare available to working parents of 3 and 4 year olds to 30 hours per week. People on Universal Credit who earn above £542 a month are exempt from the benefit cap, and lone parents need to work just 16 hours a week to be eligible for Working Tax Credits and be exempt from the benefit cap.</p><p>This Government has introduced the National Living Wage which will increase again to £8.21 from April 2019. This is expected to benefit up to 2.4m people with the rise this April increasing a full-time worker’s annual pay by over £2,750 since its introduction. Our tax changes will make basic rate tax payers £1,075 better off in 2018-19 than in 2010-11.

The relevant legislation should be changed so that all members of the Armed Forces whether they want religious ceremonies, civil partnerships or marriage, or same-sex marriage are treated equally.</p><p>The Department conducted a pilot project in 2016, under the Minister of the Armed Forces, to consider the feasibility of using the MOD estate to host the registration of civil marriages or partnerships. This pilot identified a change was required to the relevant legislation to deliver this ambition. The current legislation does not allow for the MOD sites to limit who is married, and who attends civil marriages, civil partnerships and same-sex marriages; this presents difficulties in protecting security of MOD sites. The Department is working on how we fix this anomaly and have written asking for legislative change.</p><p>Meanwhile, more widely in the Armed Forces I am determined that the MOD should continue to be a leader in supporting the LGBT community, and to build on the strong progress to date.

The UK government recognises the importance of amplifying young people's voices and the powerful impact this can have in raising the profile of the Children and Armed Conflict (CAAC) Agenda.
