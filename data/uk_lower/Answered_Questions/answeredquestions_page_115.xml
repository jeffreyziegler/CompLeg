Fees introduced in April 2016 took account, for the first time, of the full cost of providing consular services and forecast income over the Spending Review period. Consular services are funded through income received from the Consular premium (£14.93 on each standard passport issued) and fees charged for specific services provided to British nationals abroad (for example, the issue of ETDs) and legalisation services provided in the UK. Fees are differentiated between types of service. The fee for providing any individual service is the same throughout the overseas network.</p><p>We conduct an annual review of consular fees to ensure that the fees charged are appropriate and reflect the costs of providing consular services. The costs attributed to providing consular services fluctuate from year to year depending on the overall cost to Government of operating the overseas network and how these are shared amongst the different Government Departments and FCO services using the platform. The Consular Fees Model then further allocates costs across four categories of service (providing assistance, ETDs, notarial acts and legalisation of documents). For example, the increased cost in 2017-18 reflects changes to how the Consular Fees Model makes use of staff activity recording which should allow for more consistency in future, but does make comparison with prior years less relevant.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Year</p></td><td><p>Total Cost of Issuing ETDs</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013-14</p></td><td><p>£7,493,409</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014-15</p></td><td><p>£5,046,453</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015-16</p></td><td><p>£4,632,489</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016-17</p></td><td><p>£8,257,673</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017-18</p></td><td><p>£12,918,549</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p>","West Worcestershire","Harriett Baldwin",,"2018-10-11T15:41:46.69Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971742/answer","Biography information for Harriett Baldwin","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971742/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971742/answer","West Worcestershire","West Worcestershire","Harriett Baldwin","Harriett Baldwin","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971742/answer/previousversion/77294","Biography information for Harriett Baldwin","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971742/answer/previousversion/77294","Biography information for Harriett Baldwin","16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2018-09-11","Emergency Travel Documents","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what estimate he has made of the cost to the public purse of providing emergency travel documents from UK embassies in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Jo Stevens","Cardiff Central","Jo Stevens","173638"

The Department’s Health and Wellbeing Strategy for all MOD employees, military and civilian, is designed to provide guidance to the Chain of Command and civilian line managers on how to manage the health needs, both mental and physical, of their people. The aim is to maximise the number of people fit to work, managing people back to work after a period of sickness, so that they are fit and able to meet the requirements of Defence outputs, including operational effectiveness. In 2017, the Department also launched its Defence People Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2017 – 2022 with a four-step plan of implementation; promotion, prevention, detection and treatment.</p><p> </p><p>All civilian staff can access the Department’s Employee Wellbeing Service which offers emotional support and advice on life events as well as counselling services. In addition, the Speak Safe helpline provides a safe space to discuss issues relating to bullying, harassment and discrimination. The Department also has over 2000 civilian and military Mental Health First Aiders, each of whom has completed a two-day course delivered in accordance with the requirements of Mental Health First Aid England (or equivalent).</p><p> </p>","Bournemouth East","Mr Tobias Ellwood",,"2018-09-19T14:48:29.773Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971773/answer","Biography information for Mr Tobias Ellwood","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971773/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/971773/answer",,,,,,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2018-09-11","Ministry of Defence: Sick Leave","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what estimate he has made of the number of days of sick leave taken by staff in his Department for mental health reasons in each year since 2010.","false","Biography information for Justin Madders","Ellesmere Port and Neston","Justin Madders","173647"

Whilst Government and Ofgem are aware of potential approaches to minimising losses, including through the use of low resistance cables, network companies are not instructed exactly how to go about this. Instead, Ofgem sets incentives for network companies, including broader environmental incentives on losses and business carbon footprint. These incentives have encouraged the network companies to proactively manage losses on their networks to the extent to which this is possible.

This examines evidence of which prisoners are most likely to commit violence, when and where incidents are likely to occur, and what the strongest drivers of prison violence are.

We are taking significant steps to address these drivers.</p><p> </p><p>Across the prison estate, we are improving staff-prisoner relationships and regimes through recruiting an extra 3,500 staff and using these extra numbers to move to a new key worker model. This model will enable prison officers to mentor, challenge and support a small caseload of prisoners. The increased staffing levels will also support prisons to run full and consistent regimes.

Under the programme, governors at each prison will be provided with new scanners capable of detecting packages inside bodies, and sniffer dogs trained to detect new psychoactive substances.
