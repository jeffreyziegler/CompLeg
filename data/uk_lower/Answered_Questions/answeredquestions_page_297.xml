They frequently display an unrivalled approach to team working and leadership along with flexibility, respect for procedures, integrity, loyalty and an ability to adapt to new environments; in many cases this is backed up by skills and qualifications accredited against national standards. The CTP contract provides employers with unique access to the Service leaver talent pool. Employers can upload job opportunities to RightJob via the CTP website which receives over 50,000 unique hits per month, and promotes employment opportunities through regular e-bulletins sent to over 20,000 active clients. Through the resettlement contract, the CTP can link employers with the best Service leaver candidates for their vacancies. The CTP offers a high quality, no-cost recruitment service for organisations looking to recruit highly motivated, skilled and experienced Service leavers.</p><p>The MOD and the CTP strive to further improve the employment prospects of BAME Service leavers and to work with other government departments to help overcome potential societal barriers which may be experienced by some.</p><p>The BAME employment rates of Service leavers who have used the CTP at 68 per cent is 5.2 percentage points higher than the general UK BAME population. This demonstrates that serving in the Armed Forces enhances the employment prospects of BAME Service leavers when they choose to enter the employment market at the end of their military career.</p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster",,"2016-11-18T14:15:46.993Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/637022/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/637022/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/637022/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-11-15","Veterans: Employment","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what steps his Department is taking to support BAME veterans into employment.","false","Biography information for Dan Jarvis","Barnsley Central","Dan Jarvis","52941"

I am aware of an application by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council to seek approval to dispose of part of the playing fields at the closed Rock Ferry High School. The application is currently being processed by officials at the Education Funding Agency, who have sought further detail from the council about the proposal. The application can only be considered when sufficient information is available to enable the panel and the Secretary of State to assess where the capital receipt of the sale of the land will be spent and whether a local Residents’ Association will manage the remaining field for local use. The Secretary of State will consider the recommendation of the panel before making her final decision.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2016-11-22T14:09:20.813Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/637050/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/637050/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/637050/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-11-15","Rock Ferry School","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what the timetable is for a decision to be taken on the future of the Rock Ferry High School site.","false","Biography information for Frank Field","Birkenhead","Frank Field","53051"

Legislation also exists to protect, and regulate the hunting of, game and wild birds[2], which includes provisions making it an offence to use certain indiscriminate methods such as lime sticks or mist-nests to hunt game or birds. All fenced military areas are protected from poaching, and in the wider territory game reserves and special protected areas no hunting is allowed. Hot spots for illegal hunting of protected species and hunting out of season have been identified and are patrolled on a frequent basis by SBA police and environmental wardens. In addition to normal patrolling activity the SBA Police conduct extensive seasonal Police anti trapping campaigns, joint patrols with Republic of Cyprus Game Wardens, operations to remove paraphernalia used for trapping and educational programmes with local farmers.</p><p>The specific threat of illegal trapping of migratory birds is one of the SBA Administration's priorities. Since November 2014, the SBA has removed 61 acres of invasive acacia bushes, which are planted and used by illegal bird trappers at a cost in excess of €400,000. As part of their enforcement activity the SBA Police continues to work closely with non-government bodies such as the RSPB and BirdLife of Cyprus to tackle bird trapping. The SBA Administration has also participated with non-governmental organisations to endorse a Strategic Action Plan to counter illegal bird trapping, which brings various measures together to tackle the problem. This plan is currently being considered by the Republic of Cyprus.
