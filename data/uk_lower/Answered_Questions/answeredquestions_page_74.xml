The BHA works closely with the thoroughbred passport issuing office to record details on animal movement and career outcomes. This data includes broodmare and stallion registrations, and export certificates, to form a picture of post-racing careers. A project within the programme involves the creation of a database to track animal movements throughout their careers, including the movement out of racing, whether that be as a leisure horse, breeding horse, or otherwise.

HMRC has a suite of powers to tackle and challenge those who promote or otherwise enable tax avoidance and HMRC is using its powers to challenge all major promoters of avoidance schemes, including disguised remuneration (DR) avoidance schemes. In recent years, HMRC has been investigating over 100 promoters and others involved in avoidance, including disguised remuneration arrangements. In the last year, HMRC has taken litigation action against 5 scheme promoters for failure to disclose under Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (DOTAS) with others deciding to disclose to avoid litigation. Further cases will be litigated in the year ahead.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has used its powers under the Promoters of Tax Avoidance Schemes (POTAS) legislation to challenge promoters and made three successful complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority about misleading advertising; two of which relate to disguised remuneration schemes. In addition, the ‘Enablers’ penalty regime, introduced in Finance (No. 2) Act 2017, means anyone who knowingly enables another person to use an abusive tax arrangement that is later defeated by HMRC will face a penalty of 100% of the fees they have earned from that activity. HMRC consider criminal investigation and referrals to prosecuting authorities where appropriate.</p><p> </p><p>Since the announcement of the 2019 loan charge at Budget 2016, HMRC has agreed settlements on disguised remuneration schemes with employers and individuals of over 650 million pounds.

If scheme users repay the loan or agree a settlement for the tax that they owe with HMRC, they will not face the charge.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has also introduced a simplified process for those who choose to settle their use of DR avoidance schemes before the loan charge arises. DR scheme users who currently have an income of less than £50,000 and are no longer engaging in tax avoidance can automatically agree a payment plan of up to five years without the need to give HMRC any information about their income and assets.

The interferon-gamma test is more sensitive than the skin test, which means it is less likely to miss TB-infected animals (approximately 1 in 10 infected animals compared with 1 in 4 for the skin test). However, it is less specific than the skin test (on average 3-4 false positives per 100 disease-free animals tested).

In such herds the predictive value of a positive interferon-gamma test result is maximised and the cost of taking out low numbers of false positive animals is outweighed by the benefit of earlier and more complete detection of all TB-infected animals in the herd.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1052489","Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","false","2019-02-07","<p>A consistent methodology for collecting data on the number of people sleeping rough on a typical night has been in place across local authorities since 2010. Local authorities themselves decide whether to undertake a count or estimate to determine their snapshot figure. They should use the method that will most accurately reflect the number of people sleeping rough in their area. All counts and estimates are checked on the night by an independent verifier from Homeless Link, funded by the Government, to certify reliability.</p><p>Whilst Brighton and Hove conducted an estimate in 2017 and undertook a count in 2018, an estimate or count should return same figure. The latter is a visible count of those seen, and the former an evidence based assessment of those thought to be sleeping rough on a single given night. There are a number of reasons for changing methodology, including improvements in knowledge and capacity of outreach services, changes in the number of people thought to be sleeping rough or belief that the change will result in a more accurate return. Brighton has changed methodology before. In the last 9 years it has counted 6 times and estimated 3 times.</p><p>There are a range of factors which impact the number of people seen or thought to be seen sleeping rough on single night, including the weather on the night of the count or estimate. It can also be affected by where people choose to sleep, the date and time chosen by the local authority, and the availability of alternatives such as night shelters. We know the weather was unseasonably cold this year and that Severe Weather Emergency Provision (SWEP) was enforced. Undoubtably this may have meant people found alternatives to sleeping rough or bedded down deeper. However, those in SWEP are importantly still included in the resultant figure and it is unfortunately unrealistic to expect complete weather consistency year on year.</p><p>MHCLG officials are aware of the letter mentioned and that Brighton are undertaking their own formal process to address this. Attaining as comprehensive a rough sleeping figure as possible each year is crucial intelligence - not only to the Government but all those with an interest in addressing the problem of homelessness. This is why a large number of local partners are consulted as part of the count and estimate process and 244 (75 per cent) of local authorities, including Brighton and Hove, reported consultation of 5 or more different agencies. The Government also funds Homeless Link to independently verify all counts and estimates that are undertaken to further ensure they are both reliable and robust. This includes following the guidance on counting not only those sleeping rough on the street, but also those in a myriad of situations including in tents, encampments, buildings, and other places not designed for habitation.</p><p>Of course it is unrealistic to assume a count or estimate can ever be 100 per cent accurate and MHCLG is encouraging local authorities with larger numbers to improve their year-round data. However, a great deal of committed work has been undertaken in Brighton and Hove, including that backed by almost £500,000 in Rough Sleeping Initiative funding for 2018/19 and £35,000 in Cold Weather funding. As such, they’ve deservedly made an inspiring impact and this is reflected in their annual return and our own intelligence. We hope this driven work will continue in the next year with the schemes including the 2019/20 round of RSI funding (provisionally allocated at £711,524) and the Rapid Rehousing Pathway (providing £555,025 in 2018/19 and over £1.36 million provisionally allocated for 2019/20) for interventions including navigators, supported lettings and two Somewhere Safe to Stay hubs – one of which is a women-only shelter.</p><p>This Government is committed to reducing homelessness and rough sleeping. No one should ever have to sleep rough. That is why last summer we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy which sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now, but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all. The Government has now committed over £1.2 billion to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over the spending review period.</p>","South Derbyshire","Mrs Heather Wheeler",,"2019-02-07T17:42:46.837Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1052489/answer","Biography information for Mrs Heather Wheeler","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1052489/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1052489/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2019-02-01","Sleeping Rough: Brighton","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, with reference to his Department's Rough sleeping statistics autumn 2018, England, published on 31 January 2019, whether the statistics for the total number of people rough sleeping in Brighton and Hove in autumn (a) 2017 and (b) 2018  were collected using the same methodology; what steps he took to check that the data supplied by local authorities for the purposes of comparison between those two years used comparable statistics; whether he is aware of the letter dated 8 January 2019 from Conservative Councillors in Brighton and Hove to the Chair of the Brighton and Hove City Council Audit and Standards Committee on Misrepresentation of rough sleeping statistics; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Caroline Lucas","Brighton, Pavilion","Caroline Lucas","215570"
