These measures will enhance the time and resources available to support prisoners. Dedicated officers will be able to build a relationship with prisoners and be in a better position to recognise and respond to changes in their behaviour or their mental well-being.</p><p>We are continuing to work with our health partners to improve our understanding of the mental health of prisoners.

We are therefore discussing with Her Majesty’s Treasury about how we can best apply this money before we leave the European Union.</p><p>The Government has delivered significantly higher funding for breakfast clubs than that envisaged by the FEAD.
