Through the introduction of compulsory relationships and sex education (RSE) in all secondary schools, we will ensure that pupils are fully aware of the illegality of FGM and that it will not be tolerated. This has been included, alongside topics such as honour-based abuse, grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse, as core content for secondary pupils in the updated draft statutory guidance for relationships education, RSE and health education. Through these subjects we want to support all children to be healthy, happy and safe; arming them with the knowledge to recognise unhealthy behaviour in relationships, and how to seek help when necessary.</p><p>At primary level, we are introducing compulsory relationships education for all pupils, to put in place the building blocks for developing healthy relationships. There is no statutory requirement for schools to deliver teaching on FGM at primary, but schools are free to build on the core content to reflect the needs of their cohort of pupils. If a school considers the teaching of FGM to be age-appropriate for their pupils at primary, they are free to deliver this.</p><p>There will be a legal requirement for schools to consult with parents in the development of their policies for both relationships education and RSE. During this consultation, schools should share example resources with parents and ensure they understand the age-appropriate content that their child will receive. Schools will continue to be free to choose materials that are age-appropriate and sensitive to the needs of their pupils. Many organisations already provide high quality resources to support this teaching â schools can consider, for example, drawing on the expertise of the main subject associations, who also quality assure third party resources from expert organisations on specific topics.</p><p>We have committed to supporting schools and teachers to deliver these subjects to a high standard.

Generous financial incentives are offered for languages teaching, including scholarships in modern foreign languages worth Â£28,000, and tax-free bursaries, typically worth up to Â£26,000. The Department is also working in partnership with Spainâs Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to deliver Spainâs Visiting Teachers Programme to provide schools with access to a pool of qualified teachers from Spain who are able to teach MFL. For the 2019/20 academic year, the programme will be open to secondary schools and also (as a pilot) to primary schools. The Department also has a Teacher Subject Specialism Training programme which aims to improve the subject knowledge of non-specialist teachers and returning teachers in MFL and to increase the number of hours taught.</p><p>The Department has recently launched the new Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy, which will attract new teachers to all subjects, including MFLs.</p><p>A Â£4.8 million MFL Pedagogy Pilot commenced in December 2018. It is managed by the newly appointed MFL Centre for Excellence and is run through nine school-led hubs, to improve uptake and attainment in languages at Key Stages 3 and 4. A pilot project in MFL undergraduate mentoring for secondary school pupils has been launched to drive up participation in the subject, specifically targeting areas of high disadvantage to extend access to languages for all pupils.</p><p>The Department recently published and promoted a guidance leaflet<sup>[1]</sup> for parents, which explains why studying a language, as part of the EBacc, broadens opportunities in both education and employment.
