Through the introduction of compulsory relationships and sex education (RSE) in all secondary schools, we will ensure that pupils are fully aware of the illegality of FGM and that it will not be tolerated. This has been included, alongside topics such as honour-based abuse, grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse, as core content for secondary pupils in the updated draft statutory guidance for relationships education, RSE and health education. Through these subjects we want to support all children to be healthy, happy and safe; arming them with the knowledge to recognise unhealthy behaviour in relationships, and how to seek help when necessary.</p><p>At primary level, we are introducing compulsory relationships education for all pupils, to put in place the building blocks for developing healthy relationships. There is no statutory requirement for schools to deliver teaching on FGM at primary, but schools are free to build on the core content to reflect the needs of their cohort of pupils. If a school considers the teaching of FGM to be age-appropriate for their pupils at primary, they are free to deliver this.</p><p>There will be a legal requirement for schools to consult with parents in the development of their policies for both relationships education and RSE. During this consultation, schools should share example resources with parents and ensure they understand the age-appropriate content that their child will receive. Schools will continue to be free to choose materials that are age-appropriate and sensitive to the needs of their pupils. Many organisations already provide high quality resources to support this teaching – schools can consider, for example, drawing on the expertise of the main subject associations, who also quality assure third party resources from expert organisations on specific topics.</p><p>We have committed to supporting schools and teachers to deliver these subjects to a high standard. We have an initial budget of £6 million for the 2019-20 financial year to develop a programme of support for schools, which will include supporting them to make appropriate choices regarding resources.</p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086409/answer",,,,,,"2019-03-22T14:52:08.02Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086409/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086409/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-03-11","Female Genital Mutilation: Primary Education","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to educate primary school children about the harmful effects of FGM as part of relationships and sex education; and to include any such information in any relevant guidance issued to teachers.","false","Biography information for Baroness Tonge",,"Baroness Tonge","HL14434"

This is in the context of wider teaching about positive, respectful relationships including family and caring friendships, as well as respect for different beliefs. The Department has also published guidance to help schools understand how the Equality Act (2010) affects them and how to fulfil their duties under the Act.</p><p> </p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086513/answer",,,,,,"2019-03-19T15:09:33.343Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086513/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086513/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-03-11","Sex and Relationship Education: Primary Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, pursuant to the Answer of 1 March 2019 to Question 223981, what information he provides to primary schools on how they can meet their duties under the Equality Act 2010 and Public Sector Equality Duty if they choose to omit LGBT families from relationship education teaching.","false","Biography information for Caroline Lucas","Brighton, Pavilion","Caroline Lucas","230669"

In addition, we have committed to protecting leaseholders who are suffering at the hands of rogue managing agents every day from unexpected costs or excessive fees for poor quality repairs.</p><p>We intend to create a new statutory regime for freeholders based on the leaseholder rights contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. This will ensure maintenance charges must be reasonably incurred and services provided are of an acceptable standard. We will provide freeholders with the ability to challenge the reasonableness of the charges they are required to pay towards the maintenance of communal areas and facilities at the First-tier Tribunal. We are also considering whether freeholders should have a right to change the provider of maintenance services by applying to the tribunal for the appointment of a new manager. We will bring forward legislation as soon as Parliamentary time allows.</p><p>We have asked Lord Best to chair a working group to look at regulating and professionalising property agents.

Generous financial incentives are offered for languages teaching, including scholarships in modern foreign languages worth £28,000, and tax-free bursaries, typically worth up to £26,000. The Department is also working in partnership with Spain’s Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to deliver Spain’s Visiting Teachers Programme to provide schools with access to a pool of qualified teachers from Spain who are able to teach MFL. For the 2019/20 academic year, the programme will be open to secondary schools and also (as a pilot) to primary schools. The Department also has a Teacher Subject Specialism Training programme which aims to improve the subject knowledge of non-specialist teachers and returning teachers in MFL and to increase the number of hours taught.</p><p>The Department has recently launched the new Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy, which will attract new teachers to all subjects, including MFLs.</p><p>A £4.8 million MFL Pedagogy Pilot commenced in December 2018.

The report found that the Government of Sri Lanka has taken some steps to address human rights concerns and to introduce more democratic and accountable government.</p><p>These include the return of some military-held civilian land, the establishment of an Office of Missing Persons and the ratification of the Convention on Enforced Disappearances. However, as I made clear to a range of senior Ministers on my visit to Colombo in October, and to Finance Minister Marapana in January, more needs to be done. I have urged further progress on these issues, and encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to deliver meaningful devolution through constitutional reform, and to establish credible mechanisms for transitional justice.</p><p>The United Kingdom has made a long-term commitment to improving human rights in Sri Lanka. The British High Commission in Colombo is in regular contact with the Government of Sri Lanka and other key stakeholders to encourage and support the implementation of Resolution 30/1.</p>","Cities of London and Westminster","Mark Field","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086752/answer",,,,,,"2019-03-14T11:26:57.487Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086752/answer","Biography information for Mark Field","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1086752/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2019-03-11","Sri Lanka: Human Rights","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what assessment his Department has made of the Sri Lankan Government's progress towards meeting the objectives set by the UN Human Rights Council in resolutions 30/1 and 34.1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka.","true","Biography information for Mr Ranil Jayawardena","North East Hampshire","Mr Ranil Jayawardena","230918"
