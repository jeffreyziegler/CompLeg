There are two centres responsible for the diagnosis and long-term care of complex NF1 which are based at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. These centres also provide education with the National Health Service to raise and maintain awareness of NF1 and are expected to form a relationship with local health and social care providers to help optimise any care for complex NF1 patients provided locally.</p><p> </p><p>In 2010, a nationally funded service was established for patients in England with a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The purpose of this service is to ensure patients are managed consistently by experienced doctors within a multi-disciplinary setting and that they receive the highest standard of care. The service for NF2 is co-ordinated from four major clinic centres: Manchester, Cambridge, Oxford and London. Each centre has a clearly defined geographical area of responsibility and runs peripheral clinics within that area, contributing their expertise to ensure the same standard of service and care is maintained.</p><p> </p><p>Over the last few years, there has been an increase in the awareness of NF through more training of doctors and nurses, particularly through community paediatricians, development of guidelines with nurses, and links with genetic and neurology clinics.

There are two centres responsible for the diagnosis and long-term care of complex NF1 which are based at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. These centres also provide education with the National Health Service to raise and maintain awareness of NF1 and are expected to form a relationship with local health and social care providers to help optimise any care for complex NF1 patients provided locally.</p><p> </p><p>In 2010, a nationally funded service was established for patients in England with a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The purpose of this service is to ensure patients are managed consistently by experienced doctors within a multi-disciplinary setting and that they receive the highest standard of care. The service for NF2 is co-ordinated from four major clinic centres: Manchester, Cambridge, Oxford and London. Each centre has a clearly defined geographical area of responsibility and runs peripheral clinics within that area, contributing their expertise to ensure the same standard of service and care is maintained.</p><p> </p><p>Over the last few years, there has been an increase in the awareness of NF through more training of doctors and nurses, particularly through community paediatricians, development of guidelines with nurses, and links with genetic and neurology clinics. Links between expert centres have developed and improved the transfer of patients whose condition is complex to the centres. Professionals at the expert centres including consultants and specialist nurses also undertake the usual range of activities to raise awareness of the condition by giving lectures and presentations, attending conferences and publishing papers in medical journals.</p><p> </p><p>In April 2018, the former Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health and Primary Care (Steve Brine MP) met the Childhood Tumour Trust to discuss, amongst other things, raising awareness of NF.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage","236342","2019-03-28T15:15:57.31Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105015/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105015/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105015/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-03-25","Neurofibromatosis","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what discussions his Department has had with neurofibromatosis charities to help raise awareness of the condition.","false","Biography information for Wayne David","Caerphilly","Wayne David","236343"

Citizenship aims to prepare pupils to play a full and active part in society.

Mark has published an annual report highlighting best practice in leaving care services, a copy of which is available via the following link: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-implementation-adviser-for-care-leavers-first-year-report" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-implementation-adviser-for-care-leavers-first-year-report</a>.</p><p> </p><p>However, care leavers’ outcomes remain significantly worse than their peers in the general population and the government is determined to further improve the support care leavers receive as they make the challenging transition from care to independence. In addition to the new duties on local authorities mentioned above, government has introduced a range of measures to improve care leavers’ outcomes, including:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Launching 3 care leaver social impact bonds, which will use ‘payment by results’ contracts to support care leavers to engage in education, employment or training;</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Establishing 8 ‘Staying Close’ pilots, which are testing an enhanced support offer for young people leaving residential care;</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Providing additional funding for 47 local authorities, to enable them to work intensively with small caseloads of care leavers at highest risk of homelessness – as part of the cross-government rough sleeping strategy;</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Introducing a £1,000 bursary for care leavers starting an apprenticeship (local authorities are already required to provide a £2,000 bursary for care leavers who go to university; and care leavers are a priority group for receipt of a 16-19 bursary if they are in further education).</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Launching the care leaver covenant, which provides a way for organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors to show their commitment to care leavers, through providing concrete offers of support;</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Launching the next recruitment round for the Civil Service care leaver internship scheme, which provides 12-month paid internships for care leavers across government. For this intake we are hoping to place 100 care leavers in government departments across the country;</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Publishing guidance to universities on how they can improve the support they offer to care leavers.</li></ul>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2019-03-26T17:53:26.003Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1092617/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1092617/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1092617/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-03-21","Care Leavers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what recent assessment he has made of the adequacy of  care and support offered to care leavers.","false","Biography information for Dr Paul Williams","Stockton South","Dr Paul Williams","235360"

In the NHS Long Term Plan, NHS England set out that it will increase its contribution to children’s palliative care over the next five years by match funding clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) which commit to increase their investment in local children’s palliative and end of life care services. NHS England will match CCG increased investment by up to £7 million a year by 2023/24.</p><p> </p><p>The increase set out in the Long Term Plan is in addition to the existing Children’s Hospice Grant, which currently provides an annual contribution of £11 million. NHS England estimates that full match funding should more than double the additional NHS support from £11 million to a combined total of £25 million a year by 2023/24.</p><p> </p><p>The Department would expect hospices to be significant beneficiaries of the additional funding NHS England has committed to over the next five years. In many areas, children’s hospices are the main providers of children’s palliative and end of life care services. However, this new investment may also provide for community services; short break (respite) services; and out of hours support for children with palliative care needs, all of which we know is hugely valued by children and their families and carers.</p><p> </p><p>The Department believes the focus of NHS England’s planned increase to children’s palliative care services is the correct to approach to deliver sustainable and effective care for this vulnerable group of patients. Simply increasing the hospice grant is not a solution.
