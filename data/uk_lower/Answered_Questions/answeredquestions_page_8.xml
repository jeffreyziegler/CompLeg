This included the consideration of the high value scheme bids submitted by providers as part of previous sustainability and transformation partnership (STP) capital rounds, and other relevant previous representations by trusts and STPs. The other metrics being - Estates and facilities running costs; backlog costs; Critical Infrastructure Risk (a subset of the highest risk elements of backlog with a potential for significant impact e.g. fire safety); unused and functionally unsuitable space; and incidents having an impact on clinical services.</p><p>Based on that, a small number of schemes were identified as being suitable to fully fund now, given their advanced level of readiness to deliver in near future. These are the 6 projects for HIP1.</p><p>The remaining list of priority schemes was then further filtered based on a combination of criteria, including the level of Critical Infrastructure Risk in the estate and an overall check of the regional breakdown (to make sure no regions were over or under-represented), and engagements through NHS regional teams.

The new Business GCSE, which was first taught from 2017, is intended to enable students to develop as commercially minded and enterprising individuals. In 2014, for the first time, financial literacy was made statutory within the national curriculum as it is now taught as part of the citizenship curriculum for 11 to 16 year olds. Schools are free to cover enterprise and entrepreneurship teaching within their personal, social, health and economic education.</p><p> </p><p>Personal characteristics like resilience, problem-solving and good character are crucial for setting up a business. Good schools will offer a wide range of opportunities for their pupils to develop these characteristics through activities such as debating, sport and volunteering, or through programmes such as the National Citizen Service or the Cadets.</p><p> </p><p>Published in December 2017, the Government’s careers strategy aims to give young people from all backgrounds the opportunity to learn from employers about work and the skills that are valued in the workplace. The strategy introduces a new expectation that every school should offer every young person at least seven encounters with employers, including those who are self-employed, during their education as part of a high-quality careers programme.</p><p> </p><p>The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company’s network of Enterprise Advisers will support the delivery of this ambition. Enterprise Advisers are senior business volunteers who help schools and colleges to work with local businesses. At the end of June 2019, over 2,200 schools and colleges had been matched with an Enterprise Adviser. The Department will give all schools and colleges access to an Enterprise Adviser by the end of 2020.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2019-10-07T18:36:22.04Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148151/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148151/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148151/answer",,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-10-03","Business: Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he is taking to increase entrepreneurship and business education in schools.","false","Biography information for Mr Jonathan Lord","Woking","Mr Jonathan Lord","294160"

The valuations set employer contribution rates to ensure the full costs of pensions are recognised and met by employers at the point scheme liabilities arise. The last valuations of the schemes considered the position as at 31 March 2016 and were completed earlier this year. Employer contribution rates have been set and came into effect on 1 April 2019. On 19 January the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury made a written statement (HCWS1286) announcing a pause to the cost control element of the valuations. The pause was necessary following a court ruling that an element of the reforms made to schemes in 2015 gave rise to unlawful discrimination. The matter has been remitted to the Employment Tribunal to determine how the discrimination is to be remedied. The Government has confirmed that it will take steps to remedy the discrimination in all public service pension schemes.

We are also investing £26.3 million in a national network of English hubs. We have appointed 34 primary schools across England as English hubs, who are taking a leading role in supporting nearly 3000 schools to improve their teaching of reading through systematic synthetic phonics, early language development, and reading for pleasure.</p><p>The national curriculum aims to ensure that all pupils develop the habit of reading widely and often, becoming independent, fluent and enthusiastic readers who read for pleasure and for information. Reading aloud is a part of this, and teachers are encouraged to read poetry, stories and non-fiction to younger pupils, as well as longer books to older pupils.</p><p>This government recognises the importance of strong literacy skills both in work and everyday life, which is why we provide full funding through the Adult Education Budget for people who need English skills to undertake a range of courses in GCSEs, functional skills and stepping stone qualifications from entry level to Level 2. To ensure as many people as possible have developed these skills by 19, the government requires students who have not yet achieved a Grade 4 in English to study it as part of the 16-19 study programme. Students taking Level 3 apprenticeships and T-Levels need to achieve a grade 4 at GCSE or pass functional skills. In 2018, nearly 80% of 19-year-olds held a Level 2 English qualification.</p><p> </p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton","HL18030","2019-10-08T12:14:26.877Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148311/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148311/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1148311/answer",,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-10-03","Literacy","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they intend to take to ensure that everybody living in the UK is able to read and write English to a competent standard.","false","Biography information for Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth",,"Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth","HL18031"

Applications in aerospace and defence have even more challenging operating temperatures.

The Challenge is supporting battery R&amp;D from the Faraday Institution’s academic research through Innovate UK’s programme of collaborative R&amp;D and to scale-up in the cutting-edge UK Battery Industrialisation Centre.

This included the consideration of the high value scheme bids submitted by providers as part of previous sustainability and transformation partnership (STP) capital rounds, and other relevant previous representations by trusts and STPs. The other metrics being - Estates and facilities running costs; backlog costs; Critical Infrastructure Risk (a subset of the highest risk elements of backlog with a potential for significant impact e.g. fire safety); unused and functionally unsuitable space; and incidents having an impact on clinical services.</p><p>Based on that, a small number of schemes were identified as being suitable to fully fund now, given their advanced level of readiness to deliver in near future. These are the six projects for HIP1.</p><p>The remaining list of priority schemes was then further filtered based on a combination of criteria, including the level of Critical Infrastructure Risk in the estate and an overall check of the regional breakdown (to make sure no regions were over or under-represented), and engagements through National Health Service regional teams. This gave us the 21 projects identified to receive seed funding to kick start their schemes, ready for building in HIP2.</p><p>HIP scheme selection was not specifically discussed at the NHS Property Board, which did not meet during the period when final decisions were made. However, the underlying principles and issues have been discussed previously by the NHS Property Board and members were involved in discussions that led to the final selection of schemes.</p><p>Schemes will be required to submit business cases to provide the required standard assurance on the key features including patient benefits, value for money and commercial terms etc. A number of the six HIP1 schemes have submitted business cases to NHS Improvement previously but these will need to be developed further or revised to align with the current scope of their scheme. The Department is looking to speed up and streamline the business case process and approvals.</p>","Charnwood","Edward Argar","293621 ; 293622 ; 293623 ; 293624","2019-10-08T16:06:00.483Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1147856/answer","Biography information for Edward Argar","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1147856/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1147856/answer",,,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-10-02","Hospitals: Construction","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, with reference to his Department's News story of 29 September 2019, New hospital building programme, how many of those 40 hospital building projects have submitted business cases for approval.","false","Biography information for Karin Smyth","Bristol South","Karin Smyth","293625"
