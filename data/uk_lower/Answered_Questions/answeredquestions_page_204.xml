We will also continue to drive innovative employment programmes like the Prisoner Apprenticeship Pathway, where prisoners will receive high quality, employer-led training and work experience in custody that leads to a guaranteed apprenticeship on release, and the New Futures Network (NFN), that will support empowered governors to broker relationships between prisons and employers more effectively. Initiatives like these, coupled with work to incentivise employers to work with ex-offenders, will all help ensure offenders have the best chance of securing employment immediately on release.</p><p>We currently do not have comprehensive and accurate figures on the number of offenders with different types of accommodation needs, both on entry to prison and on release. Nevertheless, in the year ending March 2017, 70% of offenders released during 2016/17, excluding those released in London, to the supervision of the Community Rehabilitation Companies were settled in accommodation, whether in permanent housing, with family or friends, or in supported housing or hostels.

The Government has proposed that EU citizens who were resident in the UK before the specified date, and who have five years’ continuous residence, will be able to apply for UK settled status. Other EU citizens who have arrived before the specified date will be able to make an application to stay until they have built up the necessary five continuous years’ residence to be able to apply for UK settled status. The UK remains determined to swiftly reach an agreement that provides reassurance for both EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU.</p><p> </p><p>The Prime Minister has also proposed that there should be an Implementation Period post-exit, while we and the EU put in place the necessary preparations for the future arrangements, and to ensure that people and businesses only have to plan for one set of changes. During this time, EU citizens will continue to be able to come and live and work in the UK.</p><p>The Government is considering a range of options for the immigration system for EU citizens after the UK leaves the EU.
