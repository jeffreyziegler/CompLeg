Where students fall short of the training requirement there will be occasions where, to avoid a student being removed from training, elements of training may need to be repeated, enabling those Officer Cadets who need extra training to progress. All elements of Officer training are subject to regular and constant internal validation feedback to actively and constantly improve delivery. This involves obtaining student feedback on what is taught and the standard of delivery. This feedback is employed to identify where improvements can be made and ensure optimum effectiveness of the delivery of training. External validation of training is also conducted by the Human Resource and Training Support Group to ensure the relevant material is being delivered in training, minimising the requirement for repetition.</p><p>In the Army, first time pass rates have increased steadily over the last five years and repetition of training is now a rare occurrence among Officer Cadets. Measures to improve Officer Cadets and avoid repetition of training include improved pre-employment and induction training for permanent staff, which includes how to deliver effective feedback; briefings before each assessment on the standard expected and subsequent feedback on performance and areas for improvement. For critical assessments, Officer Cadets are given the opportunity to retake the assessment after a period of reflection.</p><p>In the Royal Air Force, to avoid repeating training,Officer Cadets' development is assessed throughout the course.

The maximum rate of deductions will not normally exceed an amount equal to 40% of the Universal Credit standard allowance. However, where it is in the best interest of vulnerable claimants, to protect them from being made homeless or having their fuel disconnected, deductions in excess of the 40% standard allowance may be applied. This is only for ‘last resort’ third party deductions for arrears of service charges, rent, gas and electricity. When we take deductions for gas and electricity arrears, we will also take them for the on-going monthly cost of these utilities.</p><p> </p><p>Claimants’ circumstances are always taken into account when applying debt repayment thresholds and to avoid undue hardship. If a claimant is in financial difficulty as a result of the level of deductions, where it relates to benefit debt, a social fund loan or rent arrears, they can request that a reduction be considered. Similarly, if a claimant is having difficulty repaying a benefit overpayment, they can request a reconsideration of the amount that is being taken. Any reduction will be based on the individual circumstances of the claimant rather than the amount of the overpayment, which helps to ensure that a sustainable repayment plan based on affordability is put in place.</p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma","169044","2018-09-11T14:21:17.65Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964336/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964336/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964336/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-09-03","Universal Credit","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps she is taking to prevent excessive deductions being taken from universal credit payments to repay debts.","false","Biography information for Frank Field","Birkenhead","Frank Field","169060"

This funding will boost the immediate support available, including providing an additional 1,750 bed spaces for those sleeping rough or at risk this winter. This will be followed by an additional £45 million in 2019-20 to continue to respond to emerging challenges and make an immediate impact.</p><p>As part of our new Rough Sleeping Strategy, published on 13 August, we will provide up to £2 million in 2018/19 in health funding. This will be used to test models of community-based provision designed to enable access to health and support services for people who are sleeping rough. We have also asked NHS England to spend up to £30 million on health services for people who sleep rough, over the next five years. Alongside this, we will ensure that people sleeping rough have access to existing local systems by providing new funding for rough sleeping navigators.</p><p>Most importantly, we will work to ensure that Safeguarding Adult Reviews are conducted when a person who sleeps rough dies or is seriously harmed as a result of abuse or neglect, whether known or suspected, and there is concern that partner agencies could have worked more effectively to protect the adult. We will consider how lessons learned from these reviews will inform improvements in local systems and services so this does not happen again.</p><p>We are clear that only by taking a holistic approach to homelessness and rough sleeping will we ensure that support is there for those who need it most. That is why our rough sleeping strategy builds on the foundation of the Homelessness Reduction Act and has prevention at its centre - stopping people from becoming homeless in the first place and providing them with the right support to find work and live independently. We are also committed to publishing a strategy on wider homelessness issues, which the cross-government Rough Sleeping and Homelessness Reduction Taskforce, will move on to address in due course.</p><p>I strongly believe that this package will achieve substantial results, alongside the work already underway. We have allocated £1.2 billion to tackling homelessness through to 2020.

The assessment period and payment structure of Universal Credit is crucial in creating and maintaining the strong work incentives at the heart of Universal Credit and provides the flexibility to adjust when claimants move in and out of work regularly.</p><p> </p><p>DWP has produced guidance to help ensure claimants, staff and representatives are aware of the importance of reporting accurate dates and the impact on payment cycles: this is available online <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-different-earning-patterns-and-your-payments/universal-credit-different-earning-patterns-and-your-payments-payment-cycles" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-different-earning-patterns-and-your-payments/universal-credit-different-earning-patterns-and-your-payments-payment-cycles</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Where people have potential income volatility because of their payment cycles, they can discuss the implications of this with their case managers and work coaches and can be referred to Personal Budgeting Support to help them manage their budgeting.</p><p> </p><p>The Real Time Information (RTI) system is working well with over 99% of individual employment records now being reported in real time. In April 2018 over a million separate RTI notifications were used in Universal Credit awards. Of those, the DWP RTI Dispute Team received under 3000 disputed earnings referrals – a query rate of less than 0.3%. Many of these queries are resolved by an explanation of how Universal Credit works. We continue to work with employers to ensure that they use the most appropriate payment practices and comply with RTI guidelines to prevent issues from occurring.</p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma","169045 ; 169046 ; 169082 ; 169083","2018-09-11T13:46:53.247Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964392/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964392/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964392/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-09-03","Universal Credit","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether she plans to introduce (a) modifications and (b) improvements to the administration of universal credit in relation to monthly pay arrangements for claimants who are not paid on the same date in each month.","false","Biography information for Ms Angela Eagle","Wallasey","Ms Angela Eagle","169084"
