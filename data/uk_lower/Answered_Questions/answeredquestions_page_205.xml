These policies should be complied with and communicated to all employees;</p><p> </p><p>- In April 2016, the National Guardian’s Office was established, based in the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Dr Henrietta Hughes was appointed as National Guardian in October 2016. The National Guardian’s role is to support whistle-blowers in the NHS and improve reporting culture. The National Guardian advises and supports a network of individuals who act independently within NHS trusts. These ‘Freedom to Speak Up Guardians’ are responsible for developing a culture of openness in NHS trusts and NHS foundations trusts in England. Local Guardians have been appointed across all NHS trusts, foundation trusts and NHS providers in primary care and the independent sector are also appointing guardians. The size of the guardian network is over 500 individuals and is still growing;</p><p> </p><p>- The Department funds a freephone helpline for the health and social care sector offering free, impartial and confidential guidance to staff who wish to raise concerns but are not sure how or what protections they have when they do;</p><p> </p><p>- In addition to these actions, in 2017 the Government introduced legislation to impose a duty on prescribed persons (such as the CQC and the professional regulatory bodies) to report annually on whistleblowing disclosures made to them;</p><p> </p><p>- The Government has also extended the definition of ‘worker’ within the whistleblowing statutory framework in the Employment Rights Act 1996 to include student nurses and student midwives, meaning those people are now afforded protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. The intention is to extend the definition further to include other healthcare students when Parliamentary time allows; and</p><p> </p><p>- The Department is looking to strengthen protection for whistle-blowers further in legislation by putting further in place regulations which prohibit discrimination against whistle-blowers (or applicants believed by the prospective employer to have been whistle-blowers) when they apply for jobs with prescribed NHS employers. This will support NHS employers in being an exemplar to others in fostering a culture of openness and a willingness to report problems with care.

These figures have been derived from administrative IT systems, which as with any large scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p><p>2.

Number of offenders in each disposal category do not sum to the total number of offenders. This is due to a difference in methodology to provide a realistic and relevant view of proven reoffending by disposal type. The first event within each disposal is taken as the start point. Therefore, some offenders will appear in more than one disposal category.</p><p>4. From October 2015 onwards, reoffending data are collected using different data sources to previous quarters. Therefore, users should be cautious when making any comparison between the October to December 2015 cohort and earlier cohorts.</p><p>5. The average OGRS4/G (Offender Group Reconviction Scale) score is used to control for some differences in offender characteristics across different offender groups. OGRS4/G is based on a well-established, peer-reviewed methodology for assessing and representing reoffending risk.</p><p>6. Adjusted2011 proportion of offenders who reoffend (%) is the OGRS4/G-adjusted reoffending rate for a given cohort. It is calculated as the observed reoffending rate for that cohort plus any difference between the OGRS4/G score in that cohort and the 2011 baseline cohort. This calculation standardises the mix of offenders in each cohort to the 2011 mix for that same cohort.</p>",,"Lord Keen of Elie",,"2017-12-06T17:25:33.157Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/792930/answer","Biography information for Lord Keen of Elie","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/792930/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/792930/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-11-21","Prison Sentences","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government how many prisoners in England and Wales who had been released after serving a prison sentence of less than a year went on to re-offend in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames",,"Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames","HL3454"

The supporting Guidance also reminds local authorities that, in planning to meet local housing and other needs, they must have due regard to national policies - such as Green Belt policy - which indicate that development should be restricted and which may restrain the ability of an authority to meet its need. We intend to introduce a simpler and more transparent method for assessing the housing needs of each community next year, along with other reforms.</p><p>However, it will still be for local authorities in consultation with local people to plan their areas using the Local Plan, and then to decide planning applications in line with that Plan and all other relevant factors.

Research shows that in Universal Credit, people are going into work faster and spending more time looking for work than under the old system.</p><p> </p><p>The Black and Ethnic Minority employment rate is currently the highest since the series began (64.7%) but the Race Disparity Audit shows us there is more to be done. In response, we have identified key areas where we want to work in partnership with other public services and the voluntary sector to test out interventions to help overcome the barriers to employment faced by different ethnic groups.</p><p> </p><p>We recognise that some people will need help with on-line claims and activity. People without digital skills will be offered support in jobcentres to make and manage their claims on-line, and also to acquire or improve core digital skills. Our work coaches have the flexibility to tailor support for individuals in difficult circumstances; they can adjust their work search requirements and conditionality to allow them to prioritise solutions to their issues. DWP has also rolled out the Universal Support initiative alongside the national roll out of Universal Credit, as part of which Local Authorities deliver both digital and budgeting support.</p><p> </p><p>It is DWP policy to use an interpreter when we need to communicate with a customer who cannot communicate adequately in English (or, in Wales, Welsh) and would otherwise be unable to conduct business with them, and clear guidance on this is available to all staff. To allow us to communicate with customers unable to speak English we can make use of a customer’s own interpreter, a local community based interpreting service, telephone interpretation service or a contracted face to face interpretation service. In addition, where there is a need to do so, we are also able to translate correspondence into foreign languages. Work Coaches are also aware of the local and national provision in their area and will support the claimant to find suitable provision to work towards removing communicating in English as a barrier towards work.</p><p> </p><p>In introducing the provision of support for a maximum of two children we recognise that some claimants are not able to make choices about the number of children in their family. That is why exceptions have been put in place to protect certain groups. We believe this policy strikes the right balance between protecting the vulnerable and encouraging families who receive benefits to make the same financial decisions as those families who support themselves solely through work.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has assessed the impact of the policy from an equality and human rights perspective throughout its development and in its implementation, thus meeting its obligations under the Public Sector Equality Duty and ensuring compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998 and other international law obligations.</p>",,"Baroness Buscombe",,"2017-12-04T17:58:50.853Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/792420/answer","Biography information for Baroness Buscombe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/792420/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/792420/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2017-11-20","Universal Credit: Ethnic Groups","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government how they propose to handle specific problems arising from Universal Credit for Black and Ethnic Minority people arising from existing poverty, digital exclusion, language difficulties, or family size.","false","Biography information for Lord Hylton",,"Lord Hylton","HL3367"

This package of measures responds to concerns raised around the first assessment period and the budgeting issues faced by some claimants at the start of their claim.</p><p> </p><p>Since the Chancellor’s budget statement, we are making Universal Credit advances more generous in three key ways. From January 2018 claimants who require support can now get an advance of up to 100 per cent of their estimated monthly entitlement while they wait for their first payment. Effectively, this removes the wait until their first payment altogether, going beyond what has been called for in Parliament and by external commentators.</p><p> </p><p>From January 2018 claimants can pay back their advances over 12 months, instead of the current six month period, making it easier for claimants to manage their finances. From spring 2018 claimants will also be able to apply for their advance online, making it even easier for claimants to receive the support they need.</p><p> </p><p>From February 2018, the seven day waiting period will be removed for all new Universal Credit claimants; this means that no claimant should wait longer than five weeks to receive their first monthly Universal Credit payment.</p><p> </p><p>From April 2018, all claimants already receiving Housing Benefit will receive two weeks’ worth of additional Housing Benefit payments at the beginning of their Universal Credit claim. This is in addition to Universal Credit support for housing costs and will help reduce the issue of rent arrears whilst claimants transition to monthly payments of Universal Credit.</p><p> </p><p>From April 2018, for claimants in temporary accommodation, local authorities will be able to recoup more of their temporary accommodation costs in UC areas directly from DWP, which will allow them to continue to offer valuable support to the most vulnerable.</p><p> </p><p>From December 2017, there will be new guidance so that Private Rented Sector claimants, who already have their Housing Benefit paid directly to landlords, are offered this option when they join Universal Credit, provided the relevant criteria continue to be met.</p><p> </p><p>Throughout rollout, we will ensure that partnership working is fundamental to the successful implementation of Universal Credit. We are exploring with Citizen’s Advice and Citizen’s Advice Scotland the scope for greater collaborative working to help claimants locally as they move to Universal Credit, within the Universal Support framework.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, we must remember that Universal Credit is primarily aimed at supporting those out of work to move into work, and once in work, to progress and increase their earnings.
