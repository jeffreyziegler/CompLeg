The then former Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation Jo Johnson, my hon. Friend for Orpington said in the House of Commons Debate about Student Maintenance Grants on 19 January 2016 (c1308) that:</p><p>“The switch from maintenance grants to loans will, in a steady state, save around £2.5 billion per year from the fiscal deficit. […] We acknowledge that a proportion of the loans will not be repaid. This is a conscious decision to invest in the skills base of our country, and protect those who go on to lower-paying graduate jobs. We forecast that the long-term annual economic savings will be around £800 million per year.”</p><p>An equality analysis was also published by the government in November 2015, which included analysis of the impacts of the change from maintenance grants to loans: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482110/bis-15-639-student-finance-equality-analysis.pdf" target="_blank">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482110/bis-15-639-student-finance-equality-analysis.pdf</a>.</p><p>There has been no further analysis of the impact of this policy, as current student loan expenditure and repayment will be impacted by all the policy changes which have been enacted since this date.</p><p>A review of post-18 education and funding is underway. This is being informed by independent advice from an expert panel, chaired by Philip Augar. The panel have undertaken an extensive programme of stakeholder engagement and evidence gathering. They will report in 2019 before government concludes the overall review.</p>","Kingswood","Chris Skidmore","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041364/answer",,,,,,"2019-01-17T17:54:44.233Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041364/answer","Biography information for Chris Skidmore","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1041364/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-01-14","Students: Grants","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment he has made of the effect on the public purse of replacing university maintenance grants with larger maintenance loans in every year since that change was introduced in 2016-17.","false","Biography information for Layla Moran","Oxford West and Abingdon","Layla Moran","208358"

This includes pressing those parties to conflict listed in the UN Secretary-General's annual report on CAAC to enter into concrete action plans with the UN to verify and release any child soldiers associated with armed groups and forces and to prevent re-recruitment. We apply diplomatic pressure to listed governments and armed groups, and fund projects to help protect and rehabilitate vulnerable children.

We have shown our support for the SRSG's recently launched Global Coalition for Reintegration (GCR) by joining the 'Friends of Reintegration' group, a forum to generate new ideas for supporting reintegration programmes for children formerly associated with armed groups. The GCR is working to provide more reliable funding to ensure higher quality, longer-term reintegration programming and prevention of re-recruitment for all children formerly recruited and used by armed groups and forces.</p><p>In 2018, the UK endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a political commitment to reduce the impact of conflict on education, and the Vancouver Principles, a political commitment to prevent the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and armed groups during the conduct of United Nations peace operations. As a member of the Group of Friends of CAAC in Geneva, we also participated in a joint statement to the 37th session of the Human Rights Council in March 2018, in which we reiterated our strong support for the mandate of the SRSG for CAAC.

The 2006 Act is backed up by the statutory Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and Their Hybrids (the Code). The Code provides owners and keepers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their horses and includes a specific section on how to tether a horse. Local authorities have powers under the 2006 Act to investigate allegations of cruelty or poor welfare. In addition, welfare organisations such as the RSPCA and World Horse Welfare (WHW) may also investigate such matters. If anyone is concerned about the way a horse has been tethered, they should report the matter either to the relevant local authority, or to the RSPCA or WHW who can investigate. If a horse is found not to be tethered appropriately, this could lead to a prosecution under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
