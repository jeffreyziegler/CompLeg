This is based on advice provided by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA). ACRA is an independent committee and reports jointly to the Secretary of State for Health (in regard to public health allocations) and NHS England in regard to CCG and primary care allocations. The formula was initially approved by NHS England in 2013 and they have now reviewed and updated the formula for 2016-17 onwards.</p><p> </p><p>The formula is based on the size of the population of each CCG and adjustments, or weights, per head for relative need for health care services and unavoidable costs between CCGs. The weights per head are based on the following:</p><p>― need due to age (typically, the more elderly the population, the higher the need per head, all else being equal);</p><p>― additional need over and above that due to age (this includes measures of health status and a number of proxies for health status such as deprivation);</p><p>― an adjustment for unmet need and health inequalities;</p><p>― unavoidable higher costs of delivering health care due to location alone, known as the Market Forces Factor (this reflects that staff, land and building costs are higher in for example London than other parts of the country); and</p><p>― an adjustment for the higher costs of providing emergency ambulance services in sparsely populated areas, and an adjustment for the higher costs of unavoidably small hospitals with 24 hour accident and emergency services in remote areas.</p><p> </p><p>The final step of the allocations process is to determine how quickly to move CCGs from their current allocation to the target allocation determined by the formula. The objective is to reduce the ‘distance from target’ so that areas furthest below their target allocation receive the biggest increases. This needs to balance against the need to ensure service stability for those areas above target, and that increases are not so large that resources are not used efficiently. The approach also takes account of the distance from target in each area for primary care and specialised services so that the overall funding position for the area is taken into account.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England recently published a technical guide to allocations which sets out all the individual factors used in determining the allocation levels.

Our air quality plan for nitrogen dioxide, published on 17 December 2015, sets out a comprehensive approach to meeting our ambition for the UK to have some of the cleanest air in the world, including by implementing a new programme of Clean Air Zones. Under the Plan, by 2020 the most polluting vehicles, including older polluting buses, will be discouraged from entering the centres of Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton, Nottingham and Derby. As part of the plan, London also has a well-developed strategy for improving air quality, including the implementation of an ultra-low emission zone by 2020 - which will cover a range of vehicles, also including buses.</p>","Harrogate and Knaresborough","Andrew Jones",,"2016-04-18T11:02:49.803Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/506721/answer","Biography information for Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/506721/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/506721/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2016-04-08","Buses: Exhaust Emissions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether his Department issues guidance to bus operators on air pollution control and leaving bus engines running idle while at a bus stand.","false","Biography information for Christian Matheson","City of Chester","Christian Matheson","32801"

Import tariffs are set by the EU.

Under WTO rules increases to EU tariffs above the level committed to, or ‘bound’ rate, require us to give compensation to affected countries (in the form of lower tariffs on other products). Any potential benefit of an import tariff increase may therefore harm another UK sector.</p><p>The latest version of the EU tariff was published in Official Journal to the EU L285 on 30 October 2015 (Council implementing Regulation EU No 1101/2014 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC|) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff).
