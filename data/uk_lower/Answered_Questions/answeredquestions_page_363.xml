The report was commissioned by BIS following the publication of the OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills in 2013. Key findings from <em>Building Skills for All</em> are:</p><ul><li>Nine million adults in England have poor basic skills.</li><li>Overall, in terms of proportion, this is average for OECD countries, but England’s young people lag behind other countries.</li><li>A third of 16-19 year olds in England have poor basic skills – three times the proportion than in high performing countries.</li><li>Eliminating the tail of low achievement could increase long term productivity growth by around 0.5%.</li></ul><p>The BIS Research Paper 195 ‘Estimation of the labour market returns to qualifications gained in English Further Education’, published in December 2014, shows that there are higher returns to qualifications achieved at younger ages and that English (and maths) Level 1 and Level 2 qualifications provide an additional wage uplift for achievers of higher learning aims. Increased earnings and employment rates following training provide an indication of the positive impact on the economy of improving skills.</p><p> </p><p>In 2012, when the PIAAC carried out the survey fieldwork for both reports, only 70% of 16-19 year olds were participating in education and training that leads to a formal qualification; compared to almost universal participation in some other OECD countries. Since then the participation age in England has been increased to age 18 and action has been taken to improve GCSE qualifications and raise standards in post-16 education. These reforms have been welcomed by the OECD in its latest report. .</p><p> </p><p>Since changing the requirement for all learners who did not achieve a Level 2 in English and maths by the age of 16 to continue to study these subjects as part of their 16-19 study programme, we have seen a positive effect on participation and attainment. In 2014/15, 97% of 16 to 19 year olds without GCSE A*-C English and/or maths attending an FE institution continued their study of these subjects. In 2015, for 17-year-olds and over, entries for English rose by 23% (30% for maths). As a result, last year there were over 4,000 more GCSE passes at grades A*-C in English by students aged 17 and over (7,500 more maths passes).</p><p>On 5 February 2016 we published a new report on the impact of poor English and maths from the perspective of employers. Some key findings are:</p><p> </p><ul><li>The vast majority of employers surveyed reported no issues with the literacy of their employees.</li><li>Employers that do offer basic skills training reported positive impacts on aspects of work such as the number of errors (63%), better capacity to meet statutory requirements (58%), being able to introduce new processes (52%) and being able to produce higher quality products (51%).</li></ul><p> </p><p>The full report can be found here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poor-basic-literacy-and-numeracy-effect-on-employers" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poor-basic-literacy-and-numeracy-effect-on-employers</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",,"Baroness Neville-Rolfe",,"2016-02-22T12:31:09.603Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/450654/answer","Biography information for Baroness Neville-Rolfe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/450654/answer","BIS-impact-of-poor-basic-literacy-and-numeracy-on-employers.pdf","Literacy and Numeracy skills","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/450654/answer",,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2016-02-04","Literacy: Young People","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of the impact on the UK economy of poor literacy skills on the part of 16–24 year-olds.","false","Biography information for Baroness Rebuck",,"Baroness Rebuck","HL5955"

Several projects can however be noted:</p><p> </p><p>- We are providing £50m over the next four years to support Bikeability cycle training in schools; £11m was provided in 2015/16. This funding will help to increase children's road awareness, encourage active travel and improve future motorists’ empathy for more vulnerable road users. We expect to train a further 1 million children with the new funding settlement.</p><p> </p><p>- We are spending £114m from 2015 onwards on the Cycling Ambition Cities programme which will accelerate their development of local cycling networks, including increased protection for cyclists at junctions.</p><p> </p><p>- In addition, through the Road Investment Strategy, Highways England will spend £100m through to 2020/21 to make around 200 locations on our major road network more cycle-friendly.</p><p> </p><p>Much more widely, however, other Government funding streams will also contribute to projects which could deliver improved cycle safety.

An important part of this is the work of the cross-government Ministerial taskforce on Child Protection.</p><p>The Child Protection Implementation Taskforce is taking a comprehensive approach to child protection through looking at the children social care system as a whole. Every stage of the child’s journey in the care system is important to safeguard and protect children. The Taskforce has looked at how we get the best people to deliver the right outcomes for allchildren– in particular through social work reform and improving leadership; through improving systems and practice – building a better performing, more innovative social care sector; and through accountability and governance, looking at how arrangements locally and nationally help to drive a strong and improving system. It is monitoring implementation and driving forward improvements and reform.</p><p>The Department for Education published a paper in January 2016 - ‘Children’s social care reform: a vision for change’ - which outlines the areas of reform the Taskforce has been looking at.

Following the UK NSC’s recommendation, bowel cancer screening in England was initially offered to men and women aged 60 to 69 years old. The original programme in England only invited people in their 60s because the risk of bowel cancer increases with age, with over 80% of bowel cancers being diagnosed in people who are aged 60 or over. In the pilot, over three times more cancers were detected in people aged over 60 than under 60, and people in their 60s were most likely to complete a testing kit. In addition there were issues about endoscopy capacity. The programme has now been extended to men and women aged up to 74. Men and women aged over 74 can self-refer for screening every two years if they wish.</p><p> </p><p>In 2011, the UK NSC recommended that screening for bowel cancer using bowel scope screening could be offered. The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is currently rolling out Bowel Scope Screening (BSS), an additional one off examination for men and women aged 55 with the aim of detecting and removing any adenomas (polyps) at an early stage to prevent bowel cancer from developing.
