The Government is actively supporting and encouraging coastal areas to diversify and transform their economies.</p><p>The Blue New Deal Action Plan outlines the importance of community involvement in coastal areas. In 2015 we provided £1.18 million to establish 118 Coastal Community Teams around the English coast to empower local communities to take control of their own areas’ regeneration and we will shortly be announcing more than 20 new Teams. The Teams ensure local partners (including the Council, community groups and businesses) work together under a local and nationally recognised structure, and agree their strategic direction and key economic priorities. All 118 Coastal Community Teams have submitted publically available Economic Plans detailing how they plan to drive forward future growth, jobs and prosperity. This placed based approach allows for public bodies to work directly with local communities to help resolve specific issues and barriers.</p><p>The Government is also supporting coastal areas to create jobs and investment. By 2017 the Coastal Communities Fund will have invested over £120 million in projects that are helping to create or safeguard over 18,000 jobs, provide more than 12,000 training places and apprenticeships, and attract over £200 million of public/ private sector co-finance. A further £90m is available between 2017 &amp; 2021 and is the first time Coastal Community Teams in England are able to bid to the Coastal Communities Fund ensuring that, wherever possible, projects have the support of the local community and meet wider economic objectives.</p><p>The Blue New Deal Action Plan suggests a national coastal brand for tourism. The Government continues to strongly encourage use of the Great British Coast logo which can be used by Coastal Community Teams to include all coastal initiatives including tourism. A number of Teams have been tailoring the logo to identify their local area within the overall coastal brand. The Blue New Deal Action Plan specifically identifies the need for an industrial strategy for the coast.

The overall security situation has improved since its low point in December 2015, with a reduction in night-time police raids and attacks by the opposition. However, this has been replaced by increased, systematic government oppression. There is compelling evidence from a range of local and international monitors, including the United Nations, that extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary arrests continue.

These are risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to cover at an acceptable cost to customers.</p><p> </p><p>If called upon, the Government Support Package (GSP) may provide support in five different scenarios. The statement made to the House by my right hon. Friend, the member for North Shropshire (Owen Paterson) on 5 June 2014 (Official Record, Col. 11WS) gives fuller details of these scenarios. It is important to note that if these risks do not materialise, there will be no cost to the taxpayer. As part of the project’s regulatory and commercial arrangements, Tideway is strongly incentivised to deliver the Tunnel on time and to budget.</p><p> </p><p>The project has an agreed threshold (130% of the original budget) for cost overruns, whether from a delay or otherwise, which is financed by Tideway. The upper end of the current estimated customer bill impact range of £20-£25 per year during the construction phase reflects expenditure at that threshold (if that is reached). If the project is late, the incentives regime applies time-related regulatory adjustments that are borne by the investors.</p><p> </p><p>If the cost threshold is reached then Tideway can apply to Ofwat for an increase in approved expenditure (and therefore customer charges), which Ofwat will determine (but may not necessarily agree) taking into account the estimated cost to complete the project, appropriate incentives, and the cost of the required additional capital based on market conditions at the time. Tideway may also make a call on the GSP for Government equity financing to enable the project to be completed, at which time the Government would become an investor in the project and would have increased rights of oversight until completion of the Tunnel.
