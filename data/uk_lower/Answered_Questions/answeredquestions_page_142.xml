We have also increased the level of support for childcare costs within Universal Credit from 70% to 85%, its highest ever level.

Instead, it supports the Universal Credit principle that work pays, regardless of the number of hours worked. Parents will also be helped to prepare for work when their youngest child is two, and look for work when they are three. This will give them the best chance of finding a job which fits in with their caring responsibilities.

Following publication of the last set of survey results in June 2016, NHS England held a consultation on the future of the VOICES survey to seek views on the approach and relevance of the survey to ensure that it remained fit for purpose. Whilst the response showed that the VOICES survey remained a valuable tool, key amongst its findings were that the majority of respondents indicated that the VOICES survey would be more helpful if the sample size were made large enough to report at a local commissioner level.</p><p>Following this, work was undertaken to revise the survey and consider approaches to a larger sample size and then put in place arrangements to re-commission the VOICES survey. NHS England has been involved in discussions with the Office for National Statistics, which collects the death registration data used to identify survey recipients, about arrangements for access to the data for the new survey. Changes to the safeguarding arrangements on data-sharing, designed to ensure any concerns about care raised via the survey can be appropriately investigated, have resulted in delays to commencing the new VOICES survey. Work is ongoing to resolve this matter, and a timetable for the publication of the next survey cannot be provided at this time.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2018-05-25T13:53:30.02Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/909344/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/909344/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/909344/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-05-22","National Survey of Bereaved People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what the timetable is for the next publication of the National Survey of Bereaved People (VOICES).","false","Biography information for Sarah Champion","Rotherham","Sarah Champion","146871"

The latest claimant count for 18-24 year olds in the Oldham local authority area is 1,415, an increase of 485 on the year, which is due in part to Universal Credit expanding the ‘Searching for Work’ conditionality group*. However, this a fall of 720 since April 2010. The Government remains committed to providing targeted support for young people so that everyone, no matter what their start in life, is given the very best chance of getting into work. That is why we offer a range of support to young people to help them prepare for and move into work or an apprenticeship.</p><p> </p><p>Young jobseekers, aged 18-21, in Oldham are being supported by the Youth Obligation Support Programme. This programme helps claimants become effective jobseekers from the start of their claim, provides tailored support and access to work-related training, including the offer of a guaranteed work experience placement if they are still unemployed after 6 months.</p><p> </p><p>Young people up to the age of 25 also receive intensive work-focused coaching and referral to additional support tailored to their individual needs, drawn from a wide menu of available local provision within Oldham. This includes work experience, sector-based work academies, traineeships and other provision.</p><p> </p><p>* <em>The claimant count is currently designated as an experimental statistic by the Office for National Statistics as a result of the roll out of Universal Credit. Universal Credit full service expands the ‘Searching for Work’ conditionality group to cover a wider group of claimants, to encourage these claimants into work or to work more. This policy decision has the effect of bringing additional people into the claimant count compared to the pre-Universal Credit system and the number of people recorded as being on the Claimant Count is therefore likely to rise.

Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) Data</p><p> </p><p>Prescription information is taken from the PCA system, supplied by NHS Prescription Services, a division of NHS Business Services Authority, and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions. (Prescribers are general practitioners, hospital doctors, dentists and non-medical prescribers such as nurses and pharmacists.)</p><p> </p><p>2. Net Ingredient Cost (NIC)</p><p> </p><p>This is the basic cost of a drug as used in primary care. This is the cost at list price excluding VAT, i.e. the price listed in the national Drug Tariff or in standard price lists and is not necessarily the price the NHS paid. It does not take into account any contract prices or discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charge income, so the amount the NHS paid will be different. NIC is used in Prescription Services reports and other analyses, as it standardises cost throughout prescribing nationally, and allows comparisons of data from different sources. The figures are in pounds.</p><p> </p><p>3. BNF Classifications</p><p> </p><p>The PCA system uses the therapeutic classifications defined in the BNF using the classification system prior to edition 70. Information on why a drug is prescribed is not available in this dataset. Since drugs can be prescribed to treat more than one condition, it may not be possible to separate the different conditions for which a drug may have been prescribed.</p><p> </p><p>The primary purpose of the BNF is to provide information for clinicians. The format of the BNF was changed with Edition 70 (September 2015 - March 2016) to make it more user friendly. However the NHS Business Service Authority, who process dispensed prescription forms and collects dispensed prescribing data and produce the PCA data, continue to use the old BNF classification system to code medicines, which has become widely used in the United Kingdom as a classification to allow comparisons between drug groups. For example it is used to report cost and trend in medicines use and supports several NHS Digital official publications. The data are used in many NHS IT systems.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine",,"2018-05-31T11:01:21.257Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/909455/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/909455/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/909455/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-05-22","Smoking","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how much his Department has spent on dispensing smoking cessation products via the NHS in each of the last three years.","false","Biography information for Mr William Wragg","Hazel Grove","Mr William Wragg","146915"

Those at the top of the supply chain may impose accreditation requirements as a way of protecting themselves from reputational or commercial damage if a supplier subsequently breaches health and safety legislation. Findings from recent HSE research, including on supply chain assurance of which accreditation is a part, show that the resulting documentary obligations can become a workstream in their own right for suppliers. Reliance on such schemes can give false reassurance if not supported by credible assessment and audit. HSE will be publishing its findings this year.</p><p> </p><p>HSE is committed to working with the industry to simplify arrangements for pre-qualification in health and safety.
