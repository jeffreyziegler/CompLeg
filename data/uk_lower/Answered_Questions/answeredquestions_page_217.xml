Illicit trade in items such as mobile phones and drugs – facilitated by supply routes such as drones – is a significant driver of the increase in assaults on staff and other prisoners.</p><p> </p><p>We are fully committed to addressing the increase in violence and assaults by increasing staffing levels and improving prisoner-staff relationships. We are making swift progress in strengthening the frontline, with 20,003 individual prison officers in post at the end of August – an increase of 1,290 since October 2016. Alongside this, we are moving to a new key worker model which will mean every residential prison officer supporting a caseload of around 6 prisoners. This will mean prisoners have a consistent, named officer to challenge and support them away from violence and reoffending. We have invested in 5,600 body-worn cameras across the prison estate, rolled out alongside training in staff interaction with prisoners, to support better relationships and give high-quality evidence to support prosecutions where assaults do take place.</p><p> </p><p>We are likewise determined to tackle the illegal flow of drugs and mobile phones into our prisons. Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has established national and regional intelligence units, which are working with law enforcement partners to develop intelligence on offenders who are involved in the illicit economy, so that we can carry out operations to find and disrupt criminal activity in prisons. We are building on this by investing £3 million to create an HMPPS Serious Organised Crime Unit, which will work closely with the Home Office and police forces to further disrupt organised crime in prisons.</p><p> </p><p>We are the first jurisdiction in the world to develop tests for psychoactive substances in prisons, and are using these and over 300 trained sniffer dogs in order to detect those using and supplying them. Anyone found with contraband will be subject to disciplinary action and police investigation. We have invested £2 million to equip every prison in England and Wales with technology to strengthen searching and security, including portable detection poles which can be deployed at fixed points such as reception, and extra portable signal detectors to use on the wings to support searches. We are working with mobile network operators to deliver ground-breaking technology, which will stop mobiles smuggled into prisons from working.</p><p> </p><p>We are also bearing down on the supply routes through which illicit items enter prisons. To date, there have been over 40 arrests and 15 convictions of criminals involved in drone activity – resulting in those convicted being sentenced to a total of more than 40 years in jail. In April 2017 we set up a specialist team of prison and police officers to improve our efforts to intercept and capture drones and bring the criminals involved to justice. We are working closely with government partners on the UK’s response to the drone threat and the development of counter drone technology. This is keeping us at the forefront of the work being progressed nationally and internationally to stop criminal use of drones.</p>","East Surrey","Mr Sam Gyimah",,"2017-11-01T17:20:45.507Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/777018/answer","Biography information for Mr Sam Gyimah","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/777018/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/777018/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-10-24","Prisons","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what steps his Department is taking to tackle (a) violence, (b) drug use, (c) use of drones and (d) use of mobile phones in prison.","false","Biography information for Dan Carden","Liverpool, Walton","Dan Carden","109457"

A culture of openness also improves the quality and relevance of the research we support.</p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is funded through the Department to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research. The NIHR invests over £1 billion into health and public health research and is committed to “adding value in research” by maximizing the potential impact of research that it funds for patients and the public. This means ensuring that it answers the right questions (including effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions), delivers research efficiently and publishes results in full in an accessible and unbiased way.</p><p> </p><p>Full and open access to the knowledge generated by research is of the utmost importance to the NIHR. Our commitment to transparency, our NIHR Journals Library, open access policy, and our endorsement of the World Health Organization joint statement on the disclosure of results ensures that ideas and knowledge derived from publicly funded research are made available and accessible for public use.</p><p> </p><p>The Government works to improve accessibility and affordability of medicines, whether funded through public research or in the private sector, through a number of activities involving a range of parties.</p><p> </p><p>The Health Service Medical Supplies (Costs) Act 2017 (the Act) amends the NHS Act 2006 to:</p><p>- Put beyond doubt that the Secretary of State can require companies in the statutory scheme to make payments to control the cost of health service medicines;</p><p>- Enable the Secretary of State to require companies to reduce the price of an unbranded generic medicine, or to impose other controls on that company’s unbranded medicine, even if the company is in the voluntary scheme, currently the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2014, for their branded medicines; and</p><p>- Enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to obtain information on sales and purchases of health service products from all parts of the supply chain, from manufacturer to pharmacy, for defined purposes.</p><p> </p><p>The Government will respond shortly to the Accelerated Access Review (AAR). The AAR made recommendations to get transformative drugs and treatments to patients faster whilst ensuring the National Health Service gets value for money and remains at the forefront of innovation.</p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance and the associated funding requirement plays an important role in ensuring that patients have access to cost-effective new medicines, including medicines developed from public research.</p><p> </p><p>The NIHR provides support for the development of new medicines, primarily through its investment in early translational research infrastructure in the NHS and through a range of research funding programmes.</p><p> </p><p>The funding provided for the NIHR research infrastructure provides the expertise and facilities the NHS needs for first-class research, which health and life sciences industry researchers can access at any stage of the clinical development process. This helps drive faster translation of basic science discoveries into tangible benefits, for patients and the health system and has been specifically designed to close the gaps in translation identified in the Cooksey review in 2006.</p><p> </p><p>All NIHR research infrastructure actively supports contract and collaborative research with the life sciences industry, and supports the commercialisation of new research and related technologies, including through spin-outs and licensing arrangements. This supports the translation of new medicines and helps grow new companies (including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)). This helps ensure the UK remains one of the best places to develop and launch innovative medicines, technologies and diagnostics, benefitting patients and the health system.</p><p> </p><p>NIHR research programmes generate high quality evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medicines for the NHS and public health services, including informing NICE guidance. The NIHR funds a number of programmes, of which The Health Technology Assessment programme is the largest. It funds independent research about the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of healthcare treatments and tests for those who plan, provide or receive care in the NHS. The NIHR also funds the Invention for Innovation (i4i) Programme that supports collaborative research and development projects in medtech SMEs, universities and the NHS on the development of innovative medical technologies by de-risking early stage projects that have a strong potential for acceptance for use in the NHS, as well as make them attractive to follow-on funders and investors.</p><p> </p><p>The NIHR Innovation Observatory (NIHRIO) applies state-of-the-art data analytics to explore trends in health innovation across drugs, medical technologies, diagnostic tools and healthcare services.

In addition to this it is not always possible to allocate spending precisely on a project that crosses many regions, for example HS2. This Department focuses on delivering outcomes for transport users, not on spending per head. An analysis of regional spend per head of resident population would not, for example, take into account the pressure that large numbers of commuters and visitors from outside of a region can add to a region’s transport networks. In addition, larger and more densely built-up areas tend to make greater use of mass public transport systems. For example, in 2015/16 there were 537 million rail journeys within the London area compared to 142 million in the North. Investment by the Department is made based on a fair and rigorous process that ensures that spending goes where it is most needed.</p>","Hereford and South Herefordshire","Jesse Norman",,"2017-10-26T14:42:11.017Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/776230/answer","Biography information for Jesse Norman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/776230/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/776230/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2017-10-23","Transport: Per Capita Costs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what his Department spent on transport infrastructure per capita in each region in (a) 2010-11, (b) 2011-12, (c) 2012-13, (d) 2013-14, (e) 2014-15 and (f) 2015-16.","false","Biography information for Dan Jarvis","Barnsley Central","Dan Jarvis","109057"
