Unlawful possession of a knife or offensive weapon is already a serious criminal offence (which carries a maximum 4 year custodial sentence). We are building on that to send a clear and unequivocal message that those who use a knife or offensive weapon to threaten another person are behaving in a wholly unacceptable manner and can expect an automatic custodial sentence.</p><p> </p><p>This Government introduced the offences of threatening with a knife or offensive weapon in public or in a school. And last year, the Government made changes to the Simple Cautions Guidance issued to police to restrict the use of cautions for certain offences, including knife possession, in all but exceptional circumstances. The Ministry of Justice is also legislating on these changes within the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, to make it absolutely clear that cautions should no longer be used for serious offences such as those involving a knife or offensive weapon.</p><p> </p><p>Within the sentencing framework, it is for judges and magistrates to decide the appropriate sentence in individual cases taking account of the harm the offence caused and the culpability of the offender. Under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, there is an obligation on courts, when sentencing for offences, to follow the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, unless it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.</p><p> </p><p>Custodial sentences for knife possession handed down at Keighley Magistrates' Court and Bradford Crown Court, for the last available year, were as follows:</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><p><strong>Offences involving the possession of a knife or offensive weapon resulting in immediate custody at selected courts.</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p>Number of offences and percentages</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td rowspan="2"><p><strong>12 months ending June 2014</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Bradford Crown Court</strong></p></td><td><p>Offences resulting in immediate custody</p></td><td><p>23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong> </strong></p></td><td><p>Custody rate (%)</p></td><td><p><em>55</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong> </strong></p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Keighley Magistrate Courts<sup>1</sup></strong></p></td><td><p>Offences resulting in immediate custody</p></td><td><p>13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p>Custody rate (%)</p></td><td><p>21</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>Source: MoJ Police National Computer (PNC)</p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p><sup>1</sup> Includes Bradford and Keighley Local Justice Area and Keighley Divison magistrates courts.</p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>In the 12 months ending June 2014 there were two aggravated knife possession offences sentenced to immediate custody at Bradford Crown Court, and there was only a single aggravated knife possession offence sentenced to immediate custody at Keighley magistrate courts.</p><p> </p><p>The figures provided have been drawn from an extract of the Police National Computer (PNC) data held by the Department.

We have conducted a fundamental review of the policy and practice of release on temporary licence (ROTL). We have already made significant changes, including the introduction of a ban on transfer to open or ROTL for any prisoner who escapes, absconds, fails to return from ROTL or commits an offence whilst on ROTL during their current sentence.</p><p>There are few ROTL failures; substantially less than 0.1% in 2013 resulting in failure. Between April and June 2014 (the latest period for which data are available), there were a total of 69 recorded temporary release failures, 40% lower than the same quarter in 2013.</p><p>The change in policy for eligibility for open conditions mentioned above was not applied retrospectively. Offenders already in open conditions were assessed by NOMS and, for the most part, they were allowed to remain in open conditions because of their current compliance with the regime and favourable risk assessment. However, any prisoners who were assessed to present an unacceptable risk in such conditions in light of their previous non-compliance were returned to closed prisons.</p><p>As at 30 June 2014, there were a total of 8 prisoners held in open prisons who are recorded as having failed their release on temporary licence on more than one occasion between 01 April 2010 and 30 June 2014. Sufficiently detailed data on failures preceding this date could not be obtained except at disproportionate cost due to changes in recording practice. “ROTL Failure” includes all recorded breaches of ROTL; ie relatively minor breaches such as late return as well as more serious breaches like failure to return or offending on ROTL.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-11-27T16:50:39.393Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156398/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156398/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156398/answer",,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-18","Prisoners' Release","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prisoners held in open prisons have previously breached a licence condition whilst released on temporary licence on more than one occasion.","false","Biography information for Philip Davies","Shipley","Philip Davies","214969"

We conducted a fundamental review of the policy and practice of release on temporary licence (ROTL) after serious failures last year. We have already made significant changes, including the introduction in May 2014 of a ban on transfer to open prison or ROTL for any prisoner who escapes, abscond, fails to return from ROTL or commits an offence whilst on ROTL during their current sentence.</p><p>Absconds and escapes have reached record lows under this Government. There are also, thankfully, few ROTL failures; only around one in a thousand releases in 2013 resulting in failure. Between April and June 2014 (the latest period for which data are available), there were a total of 69 recorded temporary release failures, 40% lower than the same quarter in 2013.</p><p>The tables attached show the number of prisoners in open prisons on 30 May 2014 who had previously absconded, escaped or breached temporary release conditions, broken down by offence and length of sentence. It is not possible, except at disproportionate cost to give data for 31 May. The data in the table is derived from a one-off exercise to look in detail at those prisoners who were in open conditions on 30 May, which was conducted as part of the review of temporary release. It should be noted that the definition of “open prison” for the purposes of this exercise included some prisons operating both open and closed conditions on the same site to ensure that all prisoners with a previous abscond, escape or serious ROTL failure were identified and assessed. It is therefore possible that a number of prisoners included in the totals were actually in closed conditions at the relevant time.</p><p>The change in policy for eligibility for open conditions mentioned above was not applied retrospectively. Offenders already in open conditions at that time were assessed by NOMS and the majority were allowed to remain in open conditions because of their current compliance with the regime and favourable risk assessment. However, any prisoners who were assessed to present an unacceptable risk in such conditions in light of their previous non-compliance were returned to closed prisons.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2015-03-02T15:08:46.5Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156416/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156416/answer","214860 table.xls","214860 table.xls","Prisoners in open prisons who previously absconded","Prisoners in open prisons who previously absconded","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156416/answer",,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-18","Open Prisons","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what offence each of the prisoners held in open prisons on 31 May 2014 who had previously (a) absconded or escaped from prison and (b) breached a licence condition while released on temporary licence had committed; and how long each such prisoner's original prison sentence was.","false","Biography information for Philip Davies","Shipley","Philip Davies","214860"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/155945","Department of Health","false","2014-11-24","<p>The Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) aims to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorisation when there is a clear unmet medical need. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for the scientific aspects of the scheme and the scientific opinion will be provided after a two-step evaluation process:</p><p> </p><p>- step I, the promising innovative medicine (PIM) designation</p><p> </p><p>- step II, the early access to medicines scientific opinion</p><p> </p><p>The PIM designation will give an indication that a product may be eligible for the EAMS (based on early clinical data) and that the development programme is on track. The PIM designation will be issued after an MHRA scientific meeting and could be given several years before the product is licensed.</p><p> </p><p>The scheme is voluntary and the opinion from MHRA does not replace the normal licensing procedures for medicines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There have been no applications from companies with products for Duchene Muscular Dystrophy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The opinion will support the prescriber and patient to make a decision on whether to use the medicine before its licence is approved. The EAMS scientific opinion is valid for one year in the first instance and lapses at this time or at the time of the grant of a marketing authorisation e.g. conditional marketing authorisation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For certain categories of medicines going through the centralised marketing authorisation procedure (European procedure), in order to meet unmet medical needs of patients and in the interest of public health, it may be necessary to grant marketing authorisations on the basis of less complete data than is normally required. In such cases, it is possible to recommend the granting of a marketing authorisation subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually, a conditional approval. The granting of a conditional marketing authorisation will allow medicines to reach patients with unmet medical needs earlier than might otherwise be the case.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A conditional marketing authorisation for the first in class medicinal product Translarna (ataluren) was granted this year. Translarna is an orphan medicinal product that is used to treat patients aged 5 years and older with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are able to walk. Translarna is expected to slow down the loss of walking ability in DMD patients. As part of the conditional marketing authorisation, the company will be required to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy of Translarna from an ongoing confirmatory study.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rare diseases are classified as conditions affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people in European Union and patients with rare conditions deserve the same quality, safety and efficacy in medicines as other patients with more common conditions. Since the pharmaceutical industry has little interest, under normal market conditions, in developing and marketing medicines intended for small numbers of patients (orphan medicinal products), the European Union offers a range of incentives to encourage the development of these medicines in order to address the unmet clinical need (orphan drug legislation, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000). These incentives include a period of 10 years market exclusivity, the provision of Protocol Assistance (scientific advice specifically tailored for orphan medicinal products) and fee reductions and waivers for regulatory procedures.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Applications for the designation of orphan medicines are reviewed by the European Medicines Agency through the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). For orphan designation, the following criteria must be fulfilled. The medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union or without incentives it is unlikely that expected sales of the medicinal product would cover the investment in its development and no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned is authorised, or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Via the MHRA, the United Kingdom takes an active role in the decision making process at the COMP, ensuring applications for Orphan Drug designation of potential drug candidates for rare diseases are appropriately recognised, encouraging companies to develop their products further. For licensing, it is compulsory for designated orphan medicinal products to use the centralised procedure to gain a marketing authorisation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The UK is fully represented at the CHMP, ensuring that applications for a Marketing Authorisation (MA) for an Orphan Drug are thoroughly and rapidly evaluated for quality, safety and efficacy and a MA is granted without undue delay for the treatment of rare diseases.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In some circumstances, marketing authorisations may undergo a more rapid regulatory review called ‘accelerated assessment’. This occurs where the Applicant can demonstrate that the medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest (particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation). For drugs for rare diseases, marketing authorisation applications may be granted as a conditional authorisation or an authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The granting of a conditional marketing authorisation allow medicines to reach patients with unmet medical needs earlier than might otherwise be the case, and ensures that additional data on a product are generated, submitted, assessed and acted upon. Under exceptional circumstances, the MA Applicant must demonstrate that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because, for example, the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are commissioning a major external review of the pathways for the development, assessment, and adoption of innovative medicines and medical technology.
