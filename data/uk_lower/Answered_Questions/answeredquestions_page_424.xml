We have met stakeholders to identify a number of priority amendments to the existing guidance and we are considering further consultation on the proposed layouts in the summer.</p><p> </p><p>Provisions in the Equality Act 2010 require service providers, such as local authorities, to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled people do not find it impossible or unreasonably difficult to enjoy a service on the same basis as non-disabled people.</p><p> </p><p>Safety of all road users is of paramount importance, and the Department supports pedestrian safety through a range of measures, providing local authorities with a wide range of tools to help them provide safer roads.</p><p> </p><p>For example, following changes made in the last few years, local authorities now have more flexibility than ever before in designing 20mph zones and limits. We have also authorised pedestrian countdown, as an additional option for authorities in choosing appropriate crossing types for different roads.</p><p> </p><p>The Department recognises that inconsiderate parking, especially on the pavement, can cause problems for blind and partially sighted pedestrians. In London there is a general ban on parking on the footway. In the rest of England there is no such prohibition but traffic authorities have wide-ranging powers to prevent people parking on the pavement and we wrote to all English traffic authorities on 27 June 2014 to remind them of this.</p><p> </p><p> </p>","Harrogate and Knaresborough","Andrew Jones","1367 ; 1368","2015-06-15T13:07:03.187Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348952/answer","Biography information for Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348952/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348952/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2015-06-08","Pedestrian Areas: Visual Impairment","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what recent discussions he has had with (a) the Highways Agency and (b) local authorities on the provision of dropped kerbs to aid the blind and partially-sighted.","false","Biography information for Ian Austin","Dudley North","Ian Austin","1369"

This is why Defra committed to producing the National Pollinator Strategy (NPS) (<a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-pollinator-strategy-for-bees-and-other-pollinators-in-england" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-pollinator-strategy-for-bees-and-other-pollinators-in-england</a>).</p><p>To help inform the NPS, Defra commissioned a report published in July 2014 on the ‘Status and Value of Pollinators and Pollination Services’ (<a href="http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&amp;Module=More&amp;Location=None&amp;Completed=0&amp;ProjectID=18916#RelatedDocuments" target="_blank">http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&amp;Module=More&amp;Location=None&amp;Completed=0&amp;ProjectID=18916#RelatedDocuments</a>). The report reviewed evidence on threats to pollinators and served to highlight the many pressures which pollinators face. A loss of flower-rich habitat is considered to be the likely primary cause of the recorded decline in diversity of wild bees and other pollinating insects. Another key finding was the uncertainty that remains over population levels. Addressing such key gaps in our understanding is one of the key aims of the NPS. Defra has commissioned a research project to develop a national pollinator monitoring framework to detect changes in pollinator populations in the future.</p><p>The NPS, published in November 2014, forms a framework for collective action to help manage and raise awareness of the pressures facing pollinators. To raise public awareness a ‘Call to Action’, “Bees’ Needs: Food and a Home” (<a href="http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/Bees-needs" target="_blank">www.wildlifetrusts.org/Bees-needs</a>) was launched in July 2014.

The scheme is based on need, rather than designed to meet set arrival projections. However, we will continue to bring groups here on a regular basis. We have said we expect the scheme to help several hundred people over three years, and we remain on track to achieve that. In addition, over 4,200 Syrians have been granted asylum or other forms of leave in the UK under our normal asylum rules since the Syrian crisis began in 2011.</p><p>We continue to work closely with the UNHCR to identify the most vulnerable people displaced by the conflict, prioritising women and children at risk, people in severe need of medical care and survivors of torture and violence. The VPR scheme runs in parallel with the UNHCR’s own Syrian humanitarian admission programme. This is because the Government believes the UK can add most value through a complementary scheme, focusing on helping the most vulnerable refugees who cannot be supported effectively in the region rather than a quota. With millions of people in need, we strongly believe that the UK can have the greatest impact by continuing to prioritise significant aid; we have donated £800 million, making the UK the second largest bi-lateral donor after the USA and helping to provide vital support to hundreds of thousands of people across the region. The Syrian conflict is a crisis of international proportions and we continue to play our full part in discussions with international partners.</p><p>The UNHCR is best placed to provide information on the number of Syrians resettled by other states to date.

The CFI will allow UK and other partner nations to work together and exchange information more freely when not deployed on operations.</p><p>The UK is now beginning to employ the JACKDAW communication system to provide a mission configurable capability that will support interoperability with NATO Allies and also bringing an increasing amount of NATO applications into service to enhance interoperability.

Wherever possible staff will try to de-escalate the situation by persuasion or negotiation. Staff only use restraint as a last resort to prevent violence, and where no other means of controlling the prisoner is possible. Where restraint techniques have to be applied, the minimum amount of force will be used for as short a time as possible. Healthcare staff examine all prisoners on whom force has been used.</p><p> </p><p>Young Offender Institutions are responsible for holding Young People aged 15 to 17 and, in separate parts of the establishment, Young Adults aged 18 to 21. NOMS has developed a specialised system of restraint which is designed and independently accredited for use with Young People. This aims to minimise any use of physical force and, where it is used, to reduce the risk of injury to Young People as far as possible.</p><p> </p><p>All prisons submit a central monthly return setting out the number of times force, including restraint has been used against individual prisoners. These figures include any incident where physical force was used against a prisoner no matter how small, including incidents where staff defend themselves from attack and where prisoners are handcuffed. The main measure used for recording use of force is the number of prisoners on whom force has been used, rather than number of individual incidents. All prisons must have local procedures in place to monitor and review the use of force within the establishment, including monitoring trends.</p><p> </p><p>Since 2010 the number of times force has been used has fallen.

Statistics on assaults by secure estate sector are provided in Chapter 8 of the Youth Justice Statistics publication, published annually in January: (<a title="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/youth-justice-annual-statistics-2013-to-2014" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/youth-justice-annual-statistics-2013-to-2014" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/youth-justice-annual-statistics-2013-to-2014</a>).</p><p> </p><p>We are currently taking forward a comprehensive programme of work to improve behaviour management in the youth secure estate, which includes a new CPS, Police and NOMS protocol to increase prosecutions for violence in adult and youth custody. A specific action plan to address violence in Young Offender Institutions (YOIs) is being taken forward by NOMS.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Overall, the number of assaults in STCs and under-18 YOIs has fallen since 2010.

The above table presents data excluding spending on bank staff using unaudited figures for the element of NHS trust expenditure relating to bank staff.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. NHS trusts existing in 2013/14 were asked to also provide prior year figures (2012/13) for Contract and Agency staff in the NHS Summarisation Schedules. These figures have not been included in the answer as the data provided only includes information from existing 2013/14 NHS trusts, rather than data from all 2012/13 trusts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The prior year figures included in Table C12 of the published accounts have not been included in the answer, as they were compiled on a different basis to the 2013/14 figures. The figures published for 2012/13 for NHS trusts are based on non-permanently employed staff which is defined as “others engaged on the objectives of the organisation and will include staff on inward secondment or loan from other organisations, bank/agency/temporary staff and contract staff.” This reconciles to the figures for those organisations in note 3 (Staff Costs 2012/13), whereas the 2013/14 figures are compiled for the first time under a stricter definition of contingent labour.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The figure for 2013/14 Contract and Agency spend staff for all NHS trusts reported in the published accounts under the heading “Temporary/Agency” (Table C12 page 197) is £1.184 billion. This is understated as one organisation did not provide the data, so the answer is based on a higher figure (including spend on bank staff) of £1.209 billion.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. In the guidance that accompanied the data collection, the definition of Contract / Agency staff is: “Agency” employee payments for the employment of staff where the staff remain employees of the agency and “Contract staff” where the NHS trust has control over numbers and qualifications of staff (in contrast to a service obtained under contract) .</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Excluded from the “Agency/Contract” category are the costs of staff recharged by another organisation where no element of overhead is included i.e. where the staff costs are shared between the NHS trust and other bodies; staff on secondment or on loan from other organisations; amounts payable to contractors in respect of the provision of services (for example, cleaning or security).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Where an NHS trust obtains foundation trust status part way through any year, the data provided is only for the part of the year the organisation operated as an NHS trust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. For the first time in 2013/14 the figures for NHS trusts and foundation trusts have been aggregated and published in the Departmental Annual Accounts together under the heading “NHS Providers”. Figures provided separately for either sector will include a small amount of cross-sector transactions that would ordinarily be eliminated if the figures were provided at group level.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Data on net spending on agency staff presented for foundation trusts for last four years is audited data from in-year returns of NHS foundation trusts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Data on net spending on agency staff presented for foundation trusts for last four quarters is unaudited data from in-year returns of NHS foundation trusts. It comprises spending on agency and contract staff.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Annual data is based on published accounts data. 2014/15 data is expected to be published next month.

This identified potential indicators for distributing the pupil premium towards economically disadvantaged pupils. These included: current and historic Free School Meal (FSM) eligibility, an indicator based on a pupil’s family being in receipt of out of work tax credits; and area-based measures of deprivation such as Mosaic or Acorn.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In response to the consultation, it was concluded that the best available indicator used to reflect socio-economic disadvantage from 2011-12 onwards would be FSM eligibility, because this is the only current pupil-level indicator; it is familiar to parents, schools and local authorities; it is easily collected and updated annually; and schools will know precisely which of their pupils are eligible. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that pupils who are currently or have recently been eligible for FSM have lower educational outcomes than their peers. In 2011-12, the pupil premium was allocated to schools on the basis of pupils currently FSM eligible; and from April 2012 onwards on the basis of pupils who have been FSM eligible at any point in the last six years.

We ask a great deal of our Service personnel and, in return, they deserve to have confidence that their families are appropriately supported.</p><p>Over the last five years this Government has achieved significant successes in this area; we amended the schools admissions code to allow schools in England to allocate a place in advance of a Service family arriving in the area, and enabled infant schools in England to admit Service children over the class size of 30. In addition, we allocated £20 million in LIBOR money in Financial Year 2014-15 to support childcare infrastructure for Service families.</p><p>One of the key tools we use to understand how Armed Forces families feel about the policies which affect them is the annual Families Continuous Attitude Survey (FAMCAS) which monitors the views of spouses and civil partners of Service personnel in key welfare areas, including employment, schooling, healthcare and accommodation. The results of the survey are used to help develop and track military personnel policies. In excess of 7,000 people completed the 2014 FAMCAS survey, with the responses showing improvements in areas such as full-time employment rates for spouses which increased from 33% in 2010 to 40% in 2014 and the numbers owning their own home, which increased from 55% to 58% in the same period.</p><p>In addition to the use of FAMCAS, officials work closely with each Service, the Service Families Federations and Armed Forces charities to understand and respond to family issues. At a senior level, the Families Forum meetings and Service Charities Partnership Board meetings provide regular opportunities for family issues to be raised and monitored with Ministers and the Chief of Defence People.</p><p>I recognise that there is more we can do to support families, which is why I am determined to drive forward projects such as the New Employment Model which aims to produce a modernised offer that reduces the impact of Service life on individuals and their families.</p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster",,"2015-06-09T15:18:28.023Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348624/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348624/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348624/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2015-06-04","Ministry of Defence: Families","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, with reference to the Prime Minister's press release of 18 August 2014, what steps he is taking to assess the impact of his Department's policies on the family.","false","Biography information for Mr David Burrowes","Enfield, Southgate","Mr David Burrowes","1192"

The Parliamentary Estates Directorate operates an Asbestos Management Plan which it uses to safely manage asbestos across the whole of the parliamentary estate, in full compliance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012.<br><br>During the successful installation of new, modern equipment in the plant room that supplies the Chamber and adjacent offices, a series of asbestos reassurance tests have been carried out. Traces of asbestos were recently found in the ventilation trunking, but extensive sampling at the vents has provided very high confidence that it is not becoming airborne.<br><br>Professor R J Willey, Managing Director of ACS Physical Risk Control Ltd has undertaken an urgent review of the evidence, and concluded: “It is my considered Opinion that, after the discovery, proper procedures were timeously followed. Detailed investigation of the results of air tests taken, over a considerable period following the discovery, show quite conclusively that there was negligible risk to any persons supplied with air from the duct system. Providing current conditions are maintained, there will be negligible risk to any persons supplied with air in the future from the duct system.”<br><br>The Commission and the House authorities regard the safety of Members, staff and the visiting public as their highest priority. Steps have therefore been taken to ensure that the ventilation system is not disturbed in any way. Steps will also be taken to eradicate the asbestos in the trunking by the end of 2015, but in the meantime we are content with this authoritative advice that there is no reason to stop using the Chamber, or the adjacent offices and spaces.</p>","Mole Valley","Sir Paul Beresford",,"2015-06-09T12:44:37.607Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348261/answer","Biography information for Sir Paul Beresford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348261/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/348261/answer",,,,,"18","House of Commons Commission","House of Commons Commission","2015-06-03","Parliament: Asbestos","1","House of Commons","To ask the hon.
