Sentencing is a matter for our independent courts, taking into account all the facts of each case. Where the offender has recent and relevant previous convictions this is a statutory aggravating factor which should increase the severity of the sentence. In addition, since December 2012 an automatic life sentence applies to any offender convicted of a second very serious sexual crime. A third conviction for a domestic burglary has a minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment. Since December 2012, threatening with a knife or bladed article in a school or public place has a minimum sentence of six months’ imprisonment, or four months’ detention for a 16 or 17 year old offender. From 17 July 2015, offenders convicted of a second or subsequent offence of possession of a knife or offensive weapon will be subject to a minimum sentence of six months’ imprisonment.</p><p> </p><p>The table below shows the highest number of previous convictions of an offender convicted of the same offence and the sentence received for the most recent offence in England and Wales, 2005 – 2014.

The requirement was a recommendation from the review and is intended to change attitudes and behaviours of advocates by equipping them with knowledge and skills for dealing with children and vulnerable people in trials of such offences. The Legal Aid Agency will implement this requirement in due course, and only those advocates who have done the training will be able to be instructed in and undertake serious sexual offences cases.</p><p> </p><p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has a wide range of training on victim awareness for its lawyers.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/389345","HM Treasury","false","2015-07-17","<p>The Government is making changes to Child Tax Credit and Universal Credit which will help put welfare spending on a more sustainable path. The Government wants to move from a low wage, high tax, high welfare society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society. That means more emphasis on support to hardworking families on low incomes by reducing income tax through increases in the personal allowance and increasing wages, than on topping up low wages through tax credits.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Families with someone working currently on the minimum wage will benefit from the introduction of the National Living Wage from April 2016 which will be set at £7.20 per hour. The Government’s ambition is for the National Living Wage to reach over £9 by 2020. This would equate to a cash rise of £5,200 a year by 2020 for those who are currently working full time on the National Minimum Wage.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>These changes will ensure that work will always pay more than a life on benefits, support will be focused more on those on the very lowest incomes and the system will be fairer upon those who pay for it, as well as those who benefit from it. Taking the welfare changes in the Budget together with the record increases in the income tax personal allowance and the introduction of the new National Living Wage, 8 out of 10 working households will be better off by 2017/18.</p><p> </p>","East Hampshire","Damian Hinds","6649","2015-07-17T13:52:57.873Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/389345/answer","Biography information for Mr Damian Hinds","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/389345/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/389345/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2015-07-13","Welfare Tax Credits","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, how his Department will monitor the effect of the changes to tax credits on the poorest (a) in-work and (b) out-of-work families.","false","Biography information for Keir Starmer","Holborn and St Pancras","Keir Starmer","6650"

This meeting was streamed live on YouTube and the draft guidance has been published on the web. RWM has given presentations to eleven Geological Society Regional Groups, and held six meetings with stakeholders, including Local Authority representatives and other members of the public who have expressed interest.</p><p>The public consultation on the draft screening guidance will take place in the autumn.</p><p>This work will support the process of formal engagement with communities interested in hosting a GDF, which will start in 2017. Current estimates are that it will take between 15 and 20 years to agree a site through the national siting process.

The Government recognises that local authorities’ own commissioning is likely to be their most important tool for facilitating their markets.

However, the Care Act is clear that prices agreed with care providers will have to reflect the new duties outlined above in relation to the promotion of sustainability of the overall market.

In order to help local authorities respond to potential situations where a provider is particularly large or geographically concentrated, and where an individual local authority may struggle to carry out this duty on its own, the Government has created a new market oversight function which will be carried out by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The CQC will act to oversee the finance of specified providers with a view to providing local authorities with early warning of financial failure and to ensure effective contingency plans can be put in place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government has also commissioned the ADASS to publish guidance for local authorities to assist them in developing contingency plans for managing provider failure which should be available by summer 2015.</p><p> </p>",,"Lord Prior of Brampton",,"2015-07-21T16:33:41.133Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/388822/answer","Biography information for Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/388822/answer","Care Act guidance.pdf","Care Act guidance.pdf","Care Act Guidance","Care Act Guidance","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/388822/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-07-09","Social Services","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they have to ensure provision of social care for non self-pay service users in the event of systemic failure in the social care market.","false","Biography information for Baroness Armstrong of Hill Top",,"Baroness Armstrong of Hill Top","HL1299"
