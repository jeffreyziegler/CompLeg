"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904269","The Senior Deputy Speaker","false","2018-05-24","<p>The Senior Deputy Speaker has asked me, as Chairman of the Services Committee, to respond on his behalf.</p><p>Parliament’s telephone system was installed in 1985 and – like much of the Palace of Westminster’s core infrastructure – is at the end of its supportable life and at significant risk of failure. Replacement parts for the system are no longer made and the organisation has been buying second hand parts for the last ten years. There are no longer providers in the marketplace that support the corresponding software. If the system were to fail we could not reliably restore the service.</p><p>Given this situation, a project was initiated in 2014 to examine the options to replace the telephone system, whilst also meeting the needs of Parliament’s mobile workforce and the impending estates challenges associated with the restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster. That project identified Skype as the most suitable solution to meet these needs.</p><p>The implementation costs, to March 2018, are £2.7 million (revenue) and £1.7 million (capital). It is forecast the total spend will be £5.1 million (revenue) and £2.6 million (capital).</p><p>The primary driver (and benefit) for the change is the continued provision of a reliable telephone system throughout Parliament. That being so, Lords Members will have the option to use Skype through provision of an at-desk telephone handset which operates independently of their computer. There are also a number of other benefits in moving to Skype for Business. Skype allows people to join meetings virtually from any location, and therefore opens up many opportunities for flexible and remote working. Users will be able to take advantage of conferencing and video calling, online meetings and document sharing capabilities. Traditional copper telephony requires re-routing and cabling work whenever a member of staff or a member of either House moves office. Skype offers a “lift and shift” approach, an easy way to facilitate the relocation of staff or members without the necessary re-routing work associated with traditional telephony. Looking ahead to the challenges of the restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster, the move to Skype will enable our telephone service to move with our users, wherever they are working. Finally, the advantage from a security point of view is that voice data on our network will have the same type of security protocols and protection as other digital data.</p>",,"Lord Laming",,"2018-05-24T16:25:13.337Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904269/answer","Biography information for Lord Laming","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904269/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904269/answer",,,,,"204",,"Senior Deputy Speaker (HoL)","2018-05-14","House of Lords: Telecommunications","2","House of Lords","To ask the Senior Deputy Speaker how much the move to Skype for Business (1) has cost so far, and (2) is anticipated to cost; and what are the anticipated benefits of the change.","false","Biography information for Baroness McIntosh of Pickering",,"Baroness McIntosh of Pickering","HL7845"

The government is committed to ensuring that vulnerable children are ready for adult life and is taking action to ensure that services protect and support children. We recognise the importance of avoiding ‘cliff edges’ in support for the most vulnerable children and the offer of support from local authorities now extends to all care leavers up to 25. ‘Working Together to Safeguard Children’ makes it clear that when children on Child Protection Plans reach 18, local authorities should consider whether support services are still required.</p><p> </p><p>As a priority, we are taking forward a review of the educational outcomes of Children in Need. This review and call for evidence, which was launched on 16 March 2018, is looking at the quality of support provided to all Children in Need including 16 and 17 year olds. We will consider the full range of views we receive in response to the call for evidence, including any around transition to adult services.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are delivering a major programme of reform to improve the support provided to Children in Need. As set out in ‘Putting Children First’ (2016), we are working to improve the quality of the workforce, develop and spread innovative practice, and improve the quality of local authority children’s services. We are also using the Department for Education’s Social Care Innovation Programme to trial programmes to improve the quality of support for adolescents, including assessing how early help and contextual safeguarding can help protect them from the specific threats they face.</p><p> </p><p>A key finding of ‘Crumbling Futures’ is that the mental health needs of children and young people appear to be one of the main issues affecting older adolescents as they progress into adulthood. The new Mental Health Support Teams proposed in the government’s Mental Health green paper will provide significant support to 16 to 18 year olds in schools and colleges. The Department for Education will also test how the teams can support vulnerable 16 to 18 year olds and other young people not in school or college, such as those in apprenticeships and other work-based learning. Additionally, the Department of Health and Social Care is setting up a new national strategic partnership with key stakeholders focused on improving the mental health of 16 to 25 year olds by encouraging more coordinated action, experimentation and robust evaluation.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2018-05-15T15:39:49.323Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/901240/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/901240/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/901240/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-05-10","Children: Social Services","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to the report Crumbling Futures published by the Children's Society in March 2018, what steps his Department is taking to ensure that 16 and 17-year-olds referred to children’s services are receiving adequate support as they transition into adulthood.","false","Biography information for Steve McCabe","Birmingham, Selly Oak","Steve McCabe","142756"

Apprentices are not required to pay for their training or assessment.</p><p> </p><p>A young person on an apprenticeship will receive at least the apprentice national minimum wage, which increased to £3.70 per hour in April 2018. In England, the mean pay for level 2 apprentices is £6.69; the level 2 median pay is £6.35. The mean pay rate for level 3 apprentices is £7.38; the level 3 median pay is £7.10.</p><p> </p><p>We are not currently considering extending the scope of Care to Learn, student financial support including the 16-19 Bursary Fund or the Childcare Grant to apprenticeships as they are classed as paid contractual employment with training.</p><p> </p><p>We are creating an apprenticeship system that is open to a wide range of people. As we continue to reform the apprenticeships system we will keep our funding for apprentices with additional needs under review.</p><p> </p><p>For apprentices claiming benefits in their own right, financial support is available for those on low incomes. Eligible apprentices may be able to claim Universal Credit or Tax Credits to help with living costs. Universal Credit is also an in-work benefit, so claimants in work on low wages, including apprentices under contract, can continue to claim support for housing. Parents of apprentices are not, however, eligible to claim Child Benefit, as apprentices, like other employees, earn a wage.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, an apprentice may be entitled to the usual in-work benefits, such as Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credits.

We are working closely with stakeholders to ensure that this happens as smoothly as possible. The overall amount of money available for supporting victims of modern slavery will not fall, but by making these changes more money is being made available to treble the period of “move on” support, which will happen at the same time, and will help people leaving victim support with their transition to other arrangements.</p><p>When considering the level of these rates, the essential needs of potential victims were assessed to be comparable to the needs of asylum seekers. This is why the tested and established methodology that has been developed to measure the level of subsistence for asylum seekers will be adopted to measure the level of subsistence for potential victims of modern slavery. The rate is reassessed annually, and in 2018 was increased to £37.75. Where it has been identified that victims of slavery have needs above those of asylum seekers or have additional entitlements under the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Beings, these needs are met within the existing Adult Victims of Modern Slavery Care Contract. The methodology includes an allowance for individuals to purchase their food, and this will be taken into consideration when considering the level of subsistence for potential victims who live in catered accommodation, to ensure consistency throughout support. <br> <br>Victims will continue to receive dedicated and expert support, which is tailored to their unique needs as victims of modern slavery. This includes access to legal aid, counselling, NHS medical and dental services. This will ensure there is a consistent approach for all individuals receiving similar government support.
