That is why we asked Universities UK (UUK) to set up a sexual violence and harassment taskforce.

As the report makes clear, low numbers of disclosures do not necessarily mean that incidents do not occur, and this is a factor to consider when making judgments on any changes in levels of disclosure.</p><p> </p><p>To support this work, the department has asked the Higher Education Funding Council to prioritise working with UUK in 2017-2018 on these important issues, including surveying the sector’s progress to make sure universities are doing all they can to protect the safety and security of their students. This will be reported on in due course.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, they have provided over £4 million funding for projects to tackle harassment and hate crime.
