In the last year we have seen the launch of specialist Cyber Crime Units in every local police force, supported by funding from Government.

The gradual decline in the proportion of pupils entered for D&amp;T GCSE started in 2001, when the subject became non-compulsory at Key Stage 4. The EBacc was first introduced in 2010.</p><p> </p><p>The EBacc encourages young people to take core academic subjects, keeping their options open for further study and future careers. The Department is clear that it should be studied alongside other subjects, such as D&amp;T, and it has been designed to allow pupils to do this.</p><p> </p><p>The Department has reformed D&amp;T GCSE so that it has a greater emphasis on the iterative design process, something that subject experts advise is at the core of contemporary industry practice. It also includes more on the technical knowledge required, including cutting edge technology and processes. These structural changes make it more accessible to pupils and easier for teachers to deliver whilst maintaining the rigour and challenge the Department expects of a GCSE subject. It will take time for the new GCSE to embed given the significant changes. The Department continues to attract more graduates into teaching and have increased the bursary offered for most D&amp;T teacher trainees through the introduction of a £12,000 bursary for trainees with a 2:2 or higher.

To better understand the reasons for the slowdown, the Department commissioned Public Health England to publish <em>A review of recent trends in mortality in England</em>, which includes comparison to other parts of the United Kingdom, the European Union and United States of America. A copy of the review is attached.</p><p>The overall slowdown in improvements is due to a range of factors operating simultaneously across a wide range of age groups, places, and causes of death. Issues include:</p><p> </p><p>- the slowdown in improvement in mortality from heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death. This is partly influenced by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and low physical activity;</p><p>- the size and frequency of recent winter peaks in mortality, which were influenced by the intensity and dominant type of influenza circulating, flu vaccine uptake and effectiveness, and is sometimes exacerbated by cold weather, especially among the very elderly people living with conditions such as dementia. Housing and fuel poverty are key to cold weather vulnerability;</p><p>- in younger adults, the cause of death that had the biggest impact was accidental poisoning, a large proportion of these deaths are due to drug misuse; and</p><p>- small increases in mortality rates from chronic lower respiratory disease in males and females, and other causes in males (including cirrhosis and other liver diseases).</p><p> </p><p>The Government remains committed to giving people five extra years of healthy, independent life by 2035 and to ensuring that everyone gets the same great healthcare no matter where they live, backed by our Long Term Plan for the National Health Service.</p>",,"Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford",,"2019-07-17T13:35:13.033Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1137951/answer","Biography information for Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1137951/answer","Recent_trends_in_mortality_in_England.pdf","Recent_trends_in_mortality_in_England.pdf","A review of recent trends in mortality in England","A review of recent trends in mortality in England","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1137951/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-07-09","Life Expectancy","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of why the UK had one of the largest slowdowns in improvements in life expectancy between 2011 and 2016 out of the 19 countries analysed by the Office for National Statistics in August 2018.","false","Biography information for Lord Mendelsohn",,"Lord Mendelsohn","HL17050"
