Since 2015, planning permission has been required for any new betting shops on the high street. In addition, the Gambling Act 2005 requires local authorities to set out in a statement of policy the principles by which they manage the gambling environment in the local area. The statement can be used to set out reasons for why it would be inconsistent with licensing objectives to grant additional licences in a given location e.g. safeguarding children or the vulnerable. The Gambling Commission advise that the use of the licensing statement of policy varies from one Local Authority to another, however where used effectively and regularly updated, they can provide an effective tool for appropriately rejecting new licenses or imposing conditions to improve safeguarding and avoid attempts at clustering.</p>","Chatham and Aylesford","Tracey Crouch","8115","2017-09-07T14:07:17.313Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756395/answer","Biography information for Tracey Crouch","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756395/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756395/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2017-09-04","Betting Shops","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, if she will introduce measures to prevent clustering of betting shops and reform planning guidance on the placement of betting shops.","false","Biography information for Jon Trickett","Hemsworth","Jon Trickett","7899"

In spring 2017, NICE reviewed the CFS/ME guideline to assess whether new research on CCFS/ME would impact on the current guideline recommendations. This included looking at new evidence concerning diagnostic criteria.

Finished consultant episodes</p><p> </p><p>A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.</p><p>2. Secondary diagnosis</p><p> </p><p>As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.</p><p> </p><p>3. Main procedure</p><p> </p><p>The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (e.g. time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures.</p><p> </p><p>4. Assessing growth through time (Admitted Patient Care)</p><p> </p><p>HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely, apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information.</p><p> </p><p>Note that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March, e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine",,"2017-09-12T16:24:28.157Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756832/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756832/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/756832/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-09-04","Visual Impairment: Diabetes","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, how many eye surgeries as a result of diabetic conditions have been performed by the NHS in the last 12 months.","false","Biography information for Keith Vaz","Leicester East","Keith Vaz","8188"
