HMRC has a range of powers available to it under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (DOTAS), Promoters of Tax Avoidance Schemes (POTAS), and the Enablers legislation. Charging penalties is not the only sanction available under these regimes. As a result of HMRC’s concerted action, a number of major promoters have now co-operated with HMRC and have either stopped selling schemes or ceased in business altogether. Those who have failed to comply with their obligations under the DOTAS legislation may face penalties. Fewer than 5 penalties have been charged in 2018.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has challenged a number of promoters under the POTAS regime, since it was introduced in 2014, which were complied with as promoters ceased promoting schemes, but none have yet reached the stage of incurring liability to a penalty. The Enablers legislation was introduced in 2017. It imposes a new penalty of 100% of the gross fees, excluding VAT, for any person who enables the use of tax avoidance arrangements that are defeated by HMRC.

In development of its Communities Framework, which builds on the work of the Civil Society Strategy, MHCLG continues to work with sector partners to consider how we can support local councils and their partners in the design and delivery of services to create socially and economically strong places where community voices are heard. We are working to ensure that models of good community decision making are included in the Communities Framework.</p>","Eastleigh","Mims Davies",,"2019-03-26T13:56:34.567Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1090986/answer","Biography information for Mims Davies","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1090986/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1090986/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2019-03-18","Third Sector","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, with reference to page 52 of the August 2018 Civil Society Strategy, what steps his Department has taken to explore with the National Association of Local Councils and others the option for local charters between a principal council, local councils and community groups setting out respective responsibilities.","false","Biography information for Mr Steve Reed","Croydon North","Mr Steve Reed","233519"

National Commissioning supports equity of access to high quality dialysis care. The service delivery contract sets out that the principle should be that home haemodialysis should always be an option for patients and that solutions should be sought to overcoming barriers that might prevent this. Decisions should be made on an individual basis but in general, patients suitable for home haemodialysis will be those who:</p><p>- have the ability and motivation to learn to carry out the process and the commitment to maintain treatment;</p><p>- are stable on dialysis;</p><p>- are free of complications and significant concomitant disease that would render home haemodialysis unsuitable or unsafe;</p><p>- have good functioning vascular access;</p><p>- have a carer who has (or carers who have) also made an informed decision to assist with the haemodialysis unless the individual is able to manage on his or her own; and</p><p>- have suitable space and facilities or an area that could be adapted within their home environment.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>NHS England’s renal services specifications can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/npc-crg/group-a/a06/" target="_blank">www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/npc-crg/group-a/a06/</a></p><p> </p><p>NHS England Specialised Services use the Renal Registry Annual Report and data to support work with local dialysis services so they are aware where variation exists so this can be considered and addressed.</p><p> </p><p>The Atlas of variation, published by Public Health England in 2015, showed that for clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England, the percentage of dialysis patients who were receiving dialysis in the home (home haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis combined) ranged from 4.1% to 44.0% (10.6-fold variation). When the seven CCGs with the highest percentages and the seven CCGs with the lowest percentages are excluded, the range is 7.6–33.7%, and the variation is 4.4-fold. Variation by parliamentary constituency is not available.</p><p> </p><p>Reasons for the degree of variation observed include differences in:</p><p> </p><p>- access to, and timely assessment by, a specialist kidney unit – working with patients to help them decide between treatments takes time, but in some areas 30% of patients are not known to their kidney team for even 90 days before they start renal replacement therapy;</p><p>- access to a multi-professional team, including staff who regularly support patients undertaking home dialysis; and</p><p>- levels of support for people undertaking home dialysis to help them maintain their independence, including access to respite in-centre dialysis.</p><p> </p><p>The Atlas can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/atlas-of-variation" target="_blank">https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/atlas-of-variation</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>According to the latest data from the UK Renal Registry (UKRR), there were 1,195 patients receiving home dialysis in the United Kingdom in 2014, 1,175 patients in 2015; and 1,256 patients in 2016. The UKRR collects, analyses and reports on data from 71 adult and 13 paediatric renal centres. Participation is mandated in England, via the national services specification published by NHS England.</p><p> </p><p>The latest report from the UK Renal Registry can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.renalreg.org/publications-reports/" target="_blank">www.renalreg.org/publications-reports/</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>No specific assessment of the cost to the National Health Service of the provision of dialysis services in a patient’s home compared to a clinical setting has been undertaken. In its assessment of the evidence regarding cost, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) set out in its guideline, ‘Renal Replacement Therapy and Conservative Management’, published in October 2018, that there is uncertainty in current UK dialysis costs, but they may be lower at home. The committee acknowledged that these treatments can have very different effects on lifestyle and recommended patient choice. The NICE guideline can be found at the following link:</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng107/resources/renal-replacement-therapy-and-conservative-management-pdf-66141542991301" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng107/resources/renal-replacement-therapy-and-conservative-management-pdf-66141542991301</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Regarding the benefits of home dialysis, there is good evidence that home dialysis therapies offer advantages for suitable patients. The limitations of thrice weekly standard in-centre haemodialysis have been recognised in recent years. However, it is very difficult to separate the effect of different case mix, the most up to date and comprehensive data does not show a survival difference between patients who received more frequent versus thrice weekly (standard regimen) haemodialysis.</p><p> </p><p>The advantage of self-care haemodialysis includes not only those related to control and convenience but also the opportunity to conduct more frequent or longer sessions to optimise health prospects. The introduction of smaller more portable haemodialysis machines also provides opportunity for travel for employment or holidays. Furthermore, these therapies are cost effective in the UK when compared with hospital treatments and have been demonstrated to be safe. Information regarding a reduction in travel times and reliance on other medicines is not available.</p><p> </p>","Winchester","Steve Brine","233478 ; 233479 ; 233480 ; 233481","2019-03-21T16:14:41.657Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1091017/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1091017/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1091017/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-03-18","Dialysis Machines","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what assessment he has made of the equity of access to home-based dialysis services in England; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Paul Farrelly","Newcastle-under-Lyme","Paul Farrelly","233465"

Variation by parliamentary constituency is not available.</p><p> </p><p>Reasons for the degree of variation observed include differences in:</p><p> </p><p>- access to, and timely assessment by, a specialist kidney unit – working with patients to help them decide between treatments takes time, but in some areas 30% of patients are not known to their kidney team for even 90 days before they start renal replacement therapy;</p><p>- access to a multi-professional team, including staff who regularly support patients undertaking home dialysis; and</p><p>- levels of support for people undertaking home dialysis to help them maintain their independence, including access to respite in-centre dialysis.</p><p> </p><p>The Atlas can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/atlas-of-variation" target="_blank">https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/atlas-of-variation</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>According to the latest data from the UK Renal Registry (UKRR), there were 1,195 patients receiving home dialysis in the United Kingdom in 2014, 1,175 patients in 2015; and 1,256 patients in 2016.

In its assessment of the evidence regarding cost, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) set out in its guideline, ‘Renal Replacement Therapy and Conservative Management’, published in October 2018, that there is uncertainty in current UK dialysis costs, but they may be lower at home. The committee acknowledged that these treatments can have very different effects on lifestyle and recommended patient choice. The NICE guideline can be found at the following link:</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng107/resources/renal-replacement-therapy-and-conservative-management-pdf-66141542991301" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng107/resources/renal-replacement-therapy-and-conservative-management-pdf-66141542991301</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Regarding the benefits of home dialysis, there is good evidence that home dialysis therapies offer advantages for suitable patients. The limitations of thrice weekly standard in-centre haemodialysis have been recognised in recent years. However, it is very difficult to separate the effect of different case mix, the most up to date and comprehensive data does not show a survival difference between patients who received more frequent versus thrice weekly (standard regimen) haemodialysis.</p><p> </p><p>The advantage of self-care haemodialysis includes not only those related to control and convenience but also the opportunity to conduct more frequent or longer sessions to optimise health prospects. The introduction of smaller more portable haemodialysis machines also provides opportunity for travel for employment or holidays. Furthermore, these therapies are cost effective in the UK when compared with hospital treatments and have been demonstrated to be safe.

DLA had not been fundamentally reformed since it was introduced over 25 years ago and it lacked some of the basic checks and reviews that are integral to most other State-funded support.</p><p> </p><p>Built on rules developed for disability benefits created in the 1970s, DLA was also a product of its time, focusing primarily on physical disabilities, whereas we now have a better understanding of the needs of individuals with mental health conditions, learning difficulties, and sensory impairments like blindness. Understanding of conditions like autism has also changed measurably. That is why we introduced PIP. Reform of DLA had long been overdue and the benefit had to be changed to better support disabled people to lead independent lives as they want to today. PIP provides an opportunity to better target support for disabled people and to enable them to lead full, active and independent lives.</p><p> </p><p>At the core of the benefit’s design is the principle that awards of the benefit should be made according to a claimant’s overall level of need; entitlement being assessed on the basis of the needs arising from a health condition or disability.

For example, there are several studies that show a positive association between RSE and contraceptive use, and between RSE and later ages for first sexual intercourse, which are behaviours that reduce the risk of teenage pregnancy. Improving contraceptive use to prevent unwanted pregnancy has the potential to reduce abortion rates.

HMRC has a range of powers available to it under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (DOTAS), Promoters of Tax Avoidance Schemes (POTAS), and the Enablers legislation. Charging penalties is not the only sanction available under these regimes. As a result of HMRC’s concerted action, a number of major promoters have now co-operated with HMRC and have either stopped selling schemes or ceased in business altogether. Those who have failed to comply with their obligations under the DOTAS legislation may face penalties.

The Government has committed to expanding Independent Child Trafficking Advocates to one third of all local authorities by April 2019. The Child Trafficking Protection Fund which, as well as providing victim support and recovery, aims to reduce vulnerability to exploitation by preventing trafficked children from going missing and potentially being retrafficked. In November 2017, the Department for Education published a Safeguarding Strategy for unaccompanied asylum seeking and refugee children. The Strategy commissioned a further 1,000 training places for carers and sup-port workers to equip them with the skills they need to identify when a child is at risk of going missing and of potentially being trafficked onwards. The Refugee Council are delivering this training and will have delivered 1,000 places by the end of March 2019.</p><p>The Home Office is also working with the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) through the Home Office National Law Enforcement Data Programme (NLEDP) to deliver a National Register of Missing Persons (NRMP).

Over the 5 year period to 2019-20, councils have access, through the Local Government Finance Settlement, to over £200 billion to deliver local services, including children’s services. Core spending power has increased from £45.1 billion in 2018-19 to £46.4 billion in 2019-20. In addition to this, local authorities estimate that in 2019-20 the sector will keep around £2.5 billion in business rates growth. Local authorities have control over the way in which this money is used, and as such this growth can be directed to support existing services or to invest in further growth.</p><p> </p><p>In the Autumn Budget, the government announced a further £410 million in 2019-20 for local authorities to invest in adult and children’s social care services. It also announced £84 million of extra funding, over the next 5 years, to support local authorities to invest in initiatives that improve social work practice and decision making. The government will continue to work closely with the sector to consider long-term children’s services funding as part of the upcoming Spending Review.</p><p> </p><p>In order to address the particular vulnerability of these children, the government updated statutory guidance for local authorities on the ‘Care of unaccompanied migrant children and child victims of modern slavery’, attached, in November 2017. This includes guidance on preventing children going missing. Department for Education data collection guidance has been revised to clarify to local authorities that all cases of looked after children who go missing – many of whom might be at heightened risk of being trafficked - are reported, including all children who have gone missing within the first 24 hours of coming to the attention of the local authority.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, the government has awarded £2.2 million from the Child Trafficking Protection Fund to seven organisations to protect vulnerable children in the UK and overseas who are at risk of trafficking.
