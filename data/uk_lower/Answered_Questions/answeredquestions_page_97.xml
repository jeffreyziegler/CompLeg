The Taskforce is developing a national drugs strategy, underpinned by advice and guidance that will support the whole of the estate to restrict supply, reduce demand and build recovery. Restricting access to illicit drugs in prison is crucial to preventing substance misuse. We are working with the police to catch and convict criminals who smuggle contraband into prisons, and exploring additional security measures and new technology to stop these incursions. Reducing demand for drugs in prison also requires us to get the incentives right. We have developed the concept of ‘Incentivised Substance Free Living’, where prisoners who can demonstrate – through regular compact-based and random mandatory testing – that they are not misusing drugs can experience better living conditions. This will support prisoners to make good decisions and prevent them developing issues with substance misuse.

We are already supporting carers in a number of ways, including through the benefit system. Since 2010 the rate of Carer’s Allowance (CA) has increased from £53.90 to £64.60 a week, meaning an additional £550 a year for carers. By 2022/23 we are forecast to spend £3.7bn a year on CA, a real terms increase of more than a third since 2016/17.</p><p> </p><p>Access to CA for pensioners and full-time students reflect long-standing principles of the benefit system and we have no plans to change the rules.</p><p> </p><p>Although there is no age limit to claiming CA, it cannot normally be paid with the State Pension. CA replaces income where the carer has given up the opportunity of full-time employment in order to care for a severely disabled person, while State Pension replaces income in retirement. For this reason, social security rules operate to prevent them being paid together, to avoid duplicate provision for the same need. However, if a carer’s State Pension is less than CA, State Pension is paid and topped up with CA to the basic weekly rate of CA. Where CA cannot be paid, the person will keep underlying entitlement to the benefit. This gives access to the additional amount for carers in Pension Credit of £36.00 a week, and even if a pensioner’s income is above the limit for Pension Credit, he or she may still be able to receive Housing Benefit.</p><p>The Government thinks it is right that people in full-time education should be supported by the educational maintenance system, via its range of loans and grants, and not the social security benefit system. That is why, as a general principle, full-time students are usually precluded from entitlement to income-related and income-maintenance benefits. Part-time students may be able to claim CA though.</p>","Truro and Falmouth","Sarah Newton",,"2018-11-20T17:52:21.287Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1007889/answer","Biography information for Sarah Newton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1007889/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1007889/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-11-15","Carer's Allowance","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment her Department has made of the potential merits of making carer's allowance available to (a) pensioners and (b) students in full-time education.","false","Biography information for Chi Onwurah","Newcastle upon Tyne Central","Chi Onwurah","191917"

Current policy is to allow public access to the Green to enable them to pass through on the paths or to use it as a recreational space. Because of the unique views that the Green affords to Parliament, we also allow the media to use the Green for the contemporaneous news reporting of events within Parliament on the basis that this is an important way of communicating to the public the political issues that are taking place. We do not permit protests or campaigning on the Green.</p><p>There are occasions when events in Parliament create exceptional media activity and demand for broadcasting space on the Green. When this occurs, we conduct a careful assessment on whether to prioritise broadcasting over public access and where the balance of public interest lies. Although we prefer to maintain dual use of the Green by public and media, on some occasions we assess that reporting from the Green must be prioritised and that it is necessary to close it to the public for safety reasons. Not to do so would limit the ability of a wide section of the broadcast media, both national, international and radio to provide high quality coverage of unfolding events in Parliament and interview the politicians involved in a secure manner.</p><p>Regarding a permanent media centre, no consideration is currently being given to this. Most media (including broadcast) arrangements are covered through the existing press lobby arrangements. Under this, nominated members of the media are accredited with membership of the Press Gallery and allocated desk space within the House of Commons and given press passes which allow access to the building. This is a long standing arrangement administered by the House of Commons with well understood rules which enables open media access to Parliament to be maintained within manageable levels.</p><p>Additionally, as well as Abingdon Green, there are broadcast points within both Houses which are used by UK domestic broadcasters for the reporting of Parliamentary business.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>",,"Lord McFall of Alcluith",,"2018-11-28T13:58:06.72Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1007913/answer","Biography information for Lord McFall of Alcluith","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1007913/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1007913/answer",,,,,"204",,"Senior Deputy Speaker (HoL)","2018-11-15","Abingdon Green: Mass Media","2","House of Lords","To ask the Senior Deputy Speaker what assessment he has made of the disruption caused by the media’s use of College Green; and what consideration, if any, is being given to the establishment of a permanent media centre elsewhere on the Parliamentary Estate.","false","Biography information for Lord Hylton",,"Lord Hylton","HL11523"
