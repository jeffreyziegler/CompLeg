The Strategy is taking a multi-strand approach. Law enforcement is very important, but it also depends on partnerships across a number of sectors, such as education, health, social services, housing, youth services, victim services and others.</p><p>We have reviewed the evidence and the strategy sets out the trends and drivers of serious violence. The evidence shows that while overall crime continues to fall, homicide, knife crime and gun crime have increased since 2014 across virtually all police force areas in England and Wales. Robbery has also risen sharply since 2016. The increases have been accompanied by a shift towards younger victims and perpetrators. About half the rise in knife/gun crime and robbery is probably due to improvements in police recording. However, for the remainder, drug-related cases seem to be an important driver. Between 2014/15 and 2016/17, homicides where either the victim or suspect were known to be involved in using or dealing illicit drugs increased from 50% to 57%</p><p>The analysis in the Serious Violence Strategy shows that changes in the drugs market is a major factor in the recent increases as: Crack-cocaine markets have strong links to serious violence and evidence suggests crack use is rising in England and Wales; County lines drugs dealing is also associated with violence and exploitation and its spread is also a key factor; It is also thought that drugs-market violence may be facilitated and spread by social media, which is used to glamorise gang or drug-selling life, taunt rivals and normalise weapons carrying; and there is an increase in the number of individuals who are most vulnerable.</p><p>Our analysis also looks at the evidence of the key risk factors which may mean a young person may have a greater propensity to get involved in crime than would otherwise be the case. It also sets out the evidence supporting the importance of early intervention with young people and encouraging positive activities to engage them in and build links with their community.</p>","Wyre and Preston North","Mr Ben Wallace",,"2018-05-30T13:12:54.947Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/908987/answer","Biography information for Mr Ben Wallace","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/908987/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/908987/answer",,,,,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2018-05-21","Knives: Crime","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what recent assessment he has made of the reasons for the rise in knife crime over the last 12 months.","false","Biography information for Faisal Rashid","Warrington South","Faisal Rashid","146347"

This includes the identification of children in need of protection and an assessment of the possible solutions available to them.

Additionally, our Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme (VCRS) targets ‘at-risk’ children and their family members in the Middle East and North Africa region.</p><p>As part of their identification and referrals process, UNHCR will establish whether registered refugees have family members overseas.

The Task Force on Shale Gas concluded in 2015 that the development of a shale gas industry would provide substantial employment in the UK, while noting that it will not be possible to ascertain an accurate estimate of the scale of this opportunity until we have a clearer idea of the amount of recoverable gas.

UK Government Investments are in ongoing discussions with insurance brokers to discuss exactly what kind of insurance they can provide. Separately, the industry trade body has been discussing possible insurance products directly with insurance providers.</p><p>Regarding the impact on tourism, the UK has world class regulation to ensure that shale exploration can happen safely, respecting local communities and safeguarding the environment.

The overwhelming majority of people cast their vote without a problem and the success of the pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take, and there was no notable adverse effect on turnout.</p><p>The estimate by the political lobby group the Electoral Reform Society is exaggerated and inaccurate.

Whilst the individual totals of votes cast in each local authority were correct, the overall total was incorrectly summed. The previously quoted total of votes cast of 206,741 should have been 234,506. As a result, the percentage of people who did not return as a proportion of number of votes cast was overstated, incorrectly given as 0.16%. The correct figure is 0.14%. The attached table contains the correct data.</p><p> </p><p>As part of its planned evaluation, the Electoral Commission will continue to collect and analyse a wide range of data and information about the pilots, including public opinion surveys, data from polling stations, turnout and postal voting data, and polling station staff surveys. We will continue to work with the Electoral Commission and other partners to ensure that the emerging data gives an accurate picture of how ID pilots were delivered.</p><p> </p>","Norwich North","Chloe Smith",,"2018-05-25T15:13:05.483Z","2018-06-01T09:26:25.193Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer","Biography information for Chloe Smith","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer","Pre evaluation voter ID polling station data  (1) (1).xlsx","Pre evaluation voter ID polling station data  (1) (1).xlsx","Pre evaluation vote ","Pre evaluation vote ","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer","Norwich North ; Norwich North","Norwich North ; Norwich North","Chloe Smith ; Chloe Smith","Chloe Smith ; Chloe Smith","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer/previousversion/59632 ; http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer/previousversion/60423","Biography information for Chloe Smith ; Biography information for Chloe Smith","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer/previousversion/59632 ; http://data.parliament.uk/resources/906297/answer/previousversion/60423","Biography information for Chloe Smith ; Biography information for Chloe Smith","53","Cabinet Office","Cabinet Office","2018-05-17","Local Government: Elections","1","House of Commons","To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, with reference to the news release entitled Thousands of voters turned away from polling stations in mandatory ID trials, published by the Electoral Reform Society on 4 May 2018, what assessment he has made of the accuracy of the estimate by the Electoral Reform Society that 3,981 people were turned away from polling stations across the five pilot areas; and if he will make an estimate of what that figure would be in the event that the scheme was rolled out nationally.","false","Biography information for Conor McGinn","St Helens North","Conor McGinn","145358"

They have a statutory duty to review and assess air quality, to declare air quality management areas (AQMAs) and to put in place action plans where air quality objectives are not being met.
