First, achieving greater transparency by, for example, requiring mobile firms to break down the cost of the different parts of the bundled mobile package a customer is purchasing. Second, a requirement for providers to introduce fairer tariffs, for example moving consumers of bundled mobile phone packages to SIM only contracts, at the end of the minimum contract period.

NHS England is responsible for delivering the commitment, in partnership with system partners and key stakeholders, through its National End of Life Care Programme Board. Key steps over the first two years include:</p><p> </p><p>- Working with Public Health England and the Care Quality Commission to provide bespoke end of life care data and support packs to Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships to plan for, and improve, end of life care services;</p><p>- Testing Personal Health Budgets for people approaching the end of life;</p><p>- Working with Health Education England to ensure that all staff involved in the delivery of end of life care have appropriate education and training choice and quality of care at the end of life and strengthening medical curricula to support choice and quality and the of life;</p><p>- Inspecting and rating NHS hospital and community services for end of life care. This new inspection approach has a clear focus on end of life care and applies in all services where end of life care is delivered;</p><p>- Developing a new indicator for the Clinical Commissioning Group Improvement and Assessment Framework (CCG IAF) to measure deaths in hospital after three or more emergency admissions in the final 90 days of life to help assess choice and quality in end of life care; and</p><p>- Supporting to trusts rated as ’inadequate or ‘needs improvement’ to improve end of life care services. At the start of 2017/18, 66 trusts were in these categories (four were inadequate). This is now down to 56.</p><p> </p><p>For 2018-19, the Government’s Mandate asks NHS England to increase the percentage of people identified as likely to be in their last year of life, so that their end of life care can be improved by personalising it according to their needs and preferences at an earlier stage. NHS England will use the Quality and Outcomes Framework to demonstrate such an increase by looking at the percentage of people who are on the general practitioner register for supportive and palliative care, and consider expected levels based on local populations. Currently the national English average is 0.37%, it is anticipated this figure will increase in the 2018/19 period.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2018-10-16T11:10:03.49Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/982939/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/982939/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/982939/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-10-08","Palliative Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if he will include end of life care in the long-term plan for the NHS; and what steps are being taken to improve end of life care.","false","Biography information for Mr Roger Godsiff","Birmingham, Hall Green","Mr Roger Godsiff","175929"

HMCTS has recently recruited 250 judges across the First-tier Tribunal; up to 125 disability-qualified members; and 226 medical members.</p><p>Of these, to date, five judges; 19 medical members; and seven disability-qualified members, have been assigned to sit in the Birmingham Social Security and Child Support Tribunal.</p><p>We are also reviewing - with the Tribunal’s judiciary - current listing practices to increase the number of cases listed on a Tribunal session.</p><p>Waiting times are calculated from receipt of the appeal to its final disposal. An appeal is not necessarily disposed of at its first hearing. The final disposal decision on the appeal may be reached after an earlier hearing had been adjourned (which may be directed by the judge for a variety of reasons, such as to seek further evidence), or after an earlier hearing date had been postponed (again, for a variety of reasons, often at the request of the appellant). An appeal may also have been decided at an earlier date by the First-tier Tribunal, only for the case to have gone on to the Upper Tribunal, to be returned once again to the First-tier, for its final disposal.</p><p>We are very sensitive to the needs of people waiting for Tribunal hearings with a wide range of physical and mental challenges. Tribunal staff, and judicial office holders, are trained accordingly, with HMCTS providing reasonable adjustments to give customers with disabilities equal access to information and services. Information on the HMCTS equality and diversity policy and handling of requests for reasonable adjustments is published on Gov.uk.</p><p>If an expedited hearing is sought, or if the Tribunal identifies a case which may benefit from an expedited hearing, a judge (or caseworker acting under delegated powers and then within 14 days subject to an automatic right to be placed before a judge) will make a case management decision on the issue taking into account all the circumstances known about the case. Such decisions may be revised on application and are subject to appeal if an error of law is made.</p><p>Latest figures indicate that since PIP was introduced, more than 3.1 million decisions have been made, and of these under 9% have been appealed and 4% have been overturned.</p>","South East Cambridgeshire","Lucy Frazer","175921","2018-10-11T16:32:55.63Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/982991/answer","Biography information for Lucy Frazer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/982991/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/982991/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-10-08","Personal Independence Payment: Appeals","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what steps his Department is taking to reduce the waiting period for personal independence payments tribunals in Birmingham; and what assessment has been made of the effect of the current waiting time on claimants.","false","Biography information for Mr Roger Godsiff","Birmingham, Hall Green","Mr Roger Godsiff","175930"
