We are supporting more companies to do research and development through the UK’s R&amp;D Tax Credits scheme. The total of R&amp;D support claimed rose to £2.45bn in 2014-15, an increase of £675m (38%) on the previous year.</p><p>An example of a specific activity in London is Tech City UK (TCUK), funded by Government, who focus their efforts to accelerate the growth of digital businesses at all stages of their development across the UK. TCUK creates a positive culture in relation to digital technology and technological entrepreneurship, and fosters the right policy and business environment for start-up and high-growth entrepreneurial businesses. It does this by connecting entrepreneurs to other businesses and investors, whilst also providing a vital feedback loop to government to ensure that policy development is fit for purpose.</p>",,"Baroness Neville-Rolfe",,"2016-10-20T14:48:59.747Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/598112/answer","Biography information for Baroness Neville-Rolfe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/598112/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/598112/answer",,,,,"201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2016-10-10","Technology: Small Businesses","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they are taking to help London’s small technology companies and to protect technology talent.","false","Biography information for Lord Taylor of Warwick",,"Lord Taylor of Warwick","HL2141"

The Department has also funded the Autism Education Trust (£650,000 in 2016-17) to deliver autism training to education professionals in England. The Trust has trained more than 100,000 education staff since 2012.

However, there have been a number of significant changes to the SEND system which particularly benefit children and young people with autism.

There are a further fourteen special free schools due to open in the future, seven of which will specialise in provision for children with autism, including the Heartlands Autism free school in Haringey and a second National Autistic Society free school, the Vanguard free school in Lambeth.

High-quality sex and relationship education (SRE) and personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education have a vital role to play in this.</p><p> </p><p>SRE is compulsory in maintained secondary schools. Academies and free schools do not have to teach SRE, but many choose to do so as part of their statutory duty to provide a broad and balanced curriculum.</p><p> </p><p>When teaching SRE, all schools, including academies through their funding agreement, must have regard to the Secretary of State's Sex and Relationship Education guidance.
