"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/453858","Department of Health","false","2016-02-26","<p>The Government recognises the invaluable contribution made by unpaid carers and the importance of supporting them in their caring roles. We are also aware that caring for people with cancer and other illnesses or disabilities can have significant financial implications both for those involved and wider society, for example, the Government, Carers UK and business representatives worked together to produce the <em>Supporting Working Carers </em>report of 2013, which estimated the costs to the exchequer of carers being unable to continue working at £1.3 billion a year.</p><p> </p><p>That is why we continue to support implementation of the improved rights for carers that were enshrined in The Care Act 2014. On the appearance of needs for support, carers have a right to an assessment that will look at a carer’s wellbeing and what support they may need in their caring role. The Department has provided £104 million of funding to local authorities for these rights in 2015/16.</p><p> </p><p>We also made an additional £400 million available to the National Health Service between 2011 and 2015 to provide carers with breaks from their caring responsibilities to sustain them in their caring role. The Better Care Fund includes £130 million of funding for carers’ breaks in 2015/16.</p><p> </p><p>In 2015 the Government extended to carers a right to request flexible working arrangements, and this helps those carers who wish to balance work and care. We are also funding a £1.6 million pilot project to explore how technology can be combined with professional support from the local authority and the assistance of informal networks to ease the pressure of caring.</p><p> </p><p>The Department is also leading the development of a new cross-Government National Carers Strategy that will look at what more we can do to support existing carers and future carers.</p><p> </p><p>We are also aware that the right support for the person they care for is crucial to improving outcomes for carers. The Independent Cancer Taskforce published its report, <em>Achieving World-Class Cancer Outcomes</em>, in July 2015. It recommended improvements across the cancer pathway, including on patient experience, support, and quality of life. NHS England is currently working with partners across the health system to determine how best to take forward these recommendations.</p><p> </p><p>As part of our approach to support people living with and beyond cancer, we announced in September 2015 that, by 2020, the 280,000 people diagnosed with cancer every year will benefit from a tailored recovery package. These recovery packages, developed in partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, will be individually designed to help each person live well beyond cancer, including elements such as physical activity programmes, psychological support and practical advice about returning to work.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2016-02-26T10:10:15.213Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/453858/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/453858/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/453858/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-02-22","Cancer: Carers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what assessment his Department has made of the financial implications of caring for people with cancer and their families.","false","Biography information for Corri Wilson","Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock","Corri Wilson","27705"

First, the Commission assesses levels of electoral inequality across all local authorities in England on an annual basis. Where the Commission determines that there are high levels of variances between wards or electoral divisions, namely where some councillors represent many more – or many fewer – voters than the average for the authority, it will initiate an electoral review to address the imbalances.</p><p>The Commission will also carry out a review at the request of a local authority. Since 2011, the Commission has carried out 48 electoral reviews of councils that have asked the Commission to intervene. The majority of requested reviews have been initiated by authorities that have asked the Commission, in particular, to consider the total number of councillors elected to the council.</p><p>Thirdly, the Commission will intervene where it believes that an electoral review will help an authority deliver effective local government.

In Birmingham, 85% of these children have had an SDQ score submitted. These figures are correct as of 31 March 2015. More information can be found in the Department’s <em>Statistical First Release Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England at 31 March 2015</em>[1].</p><p>The SDQ is an internationally validated screening tool that provides information about the behavioural and emotional health of children.

Where the SDQ score from the main carer suggests there may be a problem, the statutory guidance <em>Promoting the health and wellbeing of looked-after children</em>[2]<em>,</em> which is issued jointly by the Department for Education and Department for Health, makes clear that consideration should be given to further assessment.</p><p>The Department recently supported the research undertaken by the Rees Centre at the University of Oxford on <em>The Educational Progress of Looked-After Children in England: Linking Care and Education Data</em>[3].
