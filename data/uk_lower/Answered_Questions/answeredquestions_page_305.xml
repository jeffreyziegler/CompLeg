Further, HMRC has introduced unconscious bias training for all its staff including of course those taking part as selectors.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/605868","Department for Education","false","2016-11-03","<p>Following the Wolf Report[1], the Government removed thousands of low-quality qualifications that were not valued by employers from accountability measures. However, as highlighted in the Technical Education Reform Case for Change[2], there is still a confusing array of qualifications available to learners and employers, who struggle to identify which are appropriate for their skills needs. Learners are also faced with variation within programmes and training methods vary widely.</p><p> </p><p>The Independent Panel on Technical Education, chaired by Lord Sainsbury[3], was formed to advise the Government on measures that could improve technical education in England. Through considering best practice in the UK and internationally, and consultation with employers, providers and young people, the Independent Panel recommended moving away from the current awarding organisation market model, where qualifications that deliver similar but different outcomes compete with one another, and instead adopt a licensing approach[4].</p><p> </p><p>The Government has accepted this recommendation based on the evidence set out in the Panel’s report[5] and through considering its own evidence base as set out in the Technical Education Reform Case for Change. In particular, the Panel identified evidence that suggested ‘the current system of awarding organisations which operate in many parts of the UK (but works differently in Scotland) has very serious drawbacks. The proliferation of competing qualifications in England and Northern Ireland undermines the labour market value of vocational qualifications, and prevents employers from engaging effectively in the construction of qualifications.[6]’ The Panel also examined international technical education systems, finding our market-based approach to awarding qualifications appeared to be unique.</p><p> </p><p>Based on the evidence considered, the Panel believe that the simplicity and clarity offered by a licensing approach would bring many advantages to employers and individuals alike.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is undertaking further work to fully understand the benefits and effectively mitigate any risks this new approach may pose to post-16 education.</p><p> </p><p>[1] Wolf, A.
