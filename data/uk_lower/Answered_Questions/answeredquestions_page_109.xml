Zero hours contracts allow flexibility for both employers and individuals and are useful where work demands are irregular or where there is not a constant demand for staff. They can also provide a level of flexibility for the individual, which allows them to work around other commitments, such as study or childcare.</p><p> </p><p>However, we recognise concerns that the UK’s flexible labour market is not working fairly for everyone and that, in some cases, zero hours contracts are not used appropriately by business. That is why the Prime Minister asked Matthew Taylor to carry out his review to consider modern working practices and whether they need to change to keep pace with modern business models.</p><p> </p><p>Our detailed response to the review was published on 7 February 2018.

These promote a preventative approach designed to reduce the impact of ill health that results from activities undertaken in the workplace and includes preventative actions on work-related mental ill health. The approach applies to all employers, regardless of the size of their business or nature of the employment contract used. HSE collects statistics gathered from the Labour Force Survey on self-reported work-related stress, anxiety and depression amongst workers within the last 12 months (see: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/" target="_blank">http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/</a>).

To overcome this barrier to employment we increased the level of support for childcare costs from 70 per cent in legacy benefits, to 85 per cent within Universal Credit. This means that working families claiming Universal Credit can reclaim up to 85 per cent of their eligible childcare costs each month, up to a maximum of £646.35 for one child and £1,108.04 for two or more children.</p><p> </p><p>Claimants with a firm job offer can claim Universal Credit Childcare costs up to 1 month prior to starting work to enable their children to settle into a new routine. We also offer extra support to enable parents to pay upfront childcare costs or deposits: for example, claimants may be eligible to receive an advance of their future Universal Credit entitlement, which is interest free. Work coaches and claimants work together to ensure that, where this is taken up, repayments are affordable and manageable.</p><p> </p><p>If a budgeting advance is not appropriate, the Flexible Support Fund may also provide assistance.
