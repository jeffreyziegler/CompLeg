There is huge variation in the nature of tax disputes depending on the complexity of the taxpayer’s behaviour, the amount and type of tax at stake and the transactions undertaken. Under its statutory powers, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) resolves most civil tax disputes by agreement and without resorting to litigation where the settlement secures the tax that HMRC believes is due under the law. If the right amount can’t be agreed, the dispute goes to litigation at the Tribunal. For any dispute, HMRC’s decision on how it should be resolved is taken by the final appropriate decision maker with appropriate management oversight. For the majority of cases this will constitute authorisation by a case worker’s line manager.
