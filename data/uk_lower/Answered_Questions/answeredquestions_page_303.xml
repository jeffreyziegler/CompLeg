The Government believes efficiencies can be made without compromising the quality of community pharmacy services including public access to medicines. Our aim is to ensure that those community pharmacies upon which people depend continue to thrive and so we are establishing a Pharmacy Access Scheme, which will provide more NHS funds to certain pharmacies compared to others, considering factors such as location and the health needs of the local population. Our reforms are about improving services for patients and the public and securing efficiencies and savings. A consequence may be the closure of some pharmacies but that is not our aim.</p><p> </p><p>We are not able to assess which pharmacies may close because we do not know the financial circumstances of individual businesses or the extent to which they derive income from services commissioned locally by the NHS or local authorities or have non-NHS related income.</p><p> </p><p>The Government announced the package of reforms for the community pharmacy in 2016/17 and beyond on 20 October 2016.
