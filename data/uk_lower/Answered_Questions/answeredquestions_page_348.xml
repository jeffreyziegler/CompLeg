"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/484463","Department for Education","false","2016-04-12","<p>The Government’s education White Paper, Educational Excellence Everywhere, published on 17 March 2016, makes it clear that many parents already play a valuable role in governance and that parents will always be encouraged to serve on governing boards. Governing boards have a vital strategic role and need people with the right skills to succeed. We will always encourage parents to serve on governing boards and in many cases academy trusts will continue to find people with the skills and experience they need among parents. Moving from a representational to a fully skills-based governance model means ending the absolute requirement for academy trusts to include two elected parents on the board of trustees (or in the case of multi-academy trusts either on the board or on each local governing body). Many parents will, of course, have relevant expertise and boards will continue to be free to appoint them. Trusts may also retain elected parent trustees if they so wish.</p><p>High quality leadership and governance will be vital as we devolve more power to schools. That is why our entire approach from governance, to curriculum, to budgets, has been to give schools the freedom to adapt the model that works best for them.</p><p>The Government’s objective is to increase academies’ engagement with parents and for the first time we will be creating a new expectation that every academy puts in place arrangements for meaningful engagement with all parents, to listen to their views and feedback. This is one of a number of policies outlined in the White Paper for enabling parents to be more engaged with their children’s education and compliments more regular surveys of parental satisfaction with their children’s schools, which we will publish. We are also launching a Parent Portal to provide information on school performance, guidance on how the school system works and how to raise complaints. This new website will act as a reliable point of reference for parents so they know exactly how they can get involved in their child’s education.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson",,"2016-04-12T10:07:20.93Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/484463/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/484463/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/484463/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-03-22","Schools: Governing Bodies","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what evidence she took into account before making it her policy to abolish the right of parents to be represented on school governing bodies; and if she will place copies of such evidence in the Library.","false","Biography information for Helen Jones","Warrington North","Helen Jones","32192"

Approved implementation partners submit project proposals to ECHO in response to its Humanitarian Implementation Plan. ECHO has a number of decision-making procedures available to it: the delegation procedure, where ECHO has delegated powers for emergency humanitarian work up to a limit of €3m and a maximum duration of three months); and the empowerment procedure, where the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection may take decisions relating to emergency operations up to €30m (maximum €10m for non-urgent decisions) for a maximum of six months. These decisions are subject to a consultation procedure within the Commission. Emergency decisions exceeding €10m and non-urgent decisions exceeding €2m (and all other decisions not covered by the delegated or empowerment procedures) require the approval of the Humanitarian Aid Committee (of representatives of all EU Member States). These decisions can be made by consensus or by voting, simple majority or Qualified Majority Voting, depending on the circumstances. The voting procedure has not been used in the Humanitarian Aid Committee as yet. The timeframe for the Commission’s approval will depend on the urgency of the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>EU military interventions fall under the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy. Proposals are framed by Member States and the European External Action Service.

Statutory guidance which underpins the duty is clear that schools should cooperate with other providers to ensure that young people are aware of the full range of education and training options available to them.

Our focus is on increasing the quality of education and ensuring that schools are able to raise standards and deliver the best outcomes for children.</p><p>The academies programme is already helping to turn around struggling schools while offering our best schools the freedom to excel. Results from 2015 show that primary sponsored academies open for two years have improved their results by an average of 10 percentage points since opening. This is more than double the rate of improvement in local authority maintained schools over the same period. In addition, the 2015 GCSE results show that secondary converter academies are outperforming the national average and, despite starting from a high bar, show continued improvement.</p><p>Indeed, as Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector (HMCI) set out in the latest Ofsted annual report, academisation can lead to rapid improvements. In his letter of 10 March 2016 to the Secretary of State, HMCI also confirmed his belief that it is right to give greater autonomy to the front line and that there are some excellent multi-academy trusts that have made remarkable progress in some of the toughest areas of the country.</p><p>It is through the academies programme that we are giving more power, responsibility and freedoms directly to education professionals, who know what is best for their pupils, but within a strong framework of accountability. Academies working together in Multi-Academy Trusts are achieving substantial benefits from economies of scale, consistent practices, substantially enhanced career and leadership development opportunities for their staff and many others.</p><p>In addition, the international evidence shows that autonomy for schools, with strong leadership and accountability in place, is linked to improved performance. A PISA in Focus study from 2011, for example, concluded “it is a combination of several autonomy and accountability policies, not just a single, isolated policy that is related to better student outcomes”.</p><p>A fully academised schools system, in which great teachers and leaders are able to spread their influence, strong multi-academy trusts can grow, and underperformance is swiftly tackled, will help ensure that every child receives an excellent education.</p>",,"Lord Nash",,"2016-04-14T13:57:52.963Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/483306/answer","Biography information for Lord Nash","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/483306/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/483306/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-03-21","Academies","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what quality of education criteria and evidence of education achievement levels have been considered to justify the proposed academisation of schools.","false","Biography information for Lord Ouseley",,"Lord Ouseley","HL7230"

The Department for International Development works with many suppliers and partners to deliver hundreds of individual programmes, often in complex and high risk environments. It has rigorous internal systems and processes to ensure that its aid reaches the intended beneficiaries and delivers the intended results. These are reflected in a detailed programme management framework (known as the Smart Rules) which sets out rules and principles designed to ensure all funding is spent as intended and delivers value for money.</p><p> </p><p>Due Diligence Assessments are undertaken on organisations receiving funding from DFID. The Department also uses delivery chain maps to understand the number and complexity of suppliers involved in a programme and how funds flow to the beneficiaries. These tools allow us to identify, understand and manage potential risks as programmes are delivered and to ensure that funds are properly accounted for. Risk levels are regularly reviewed and programmes closed if risk levels rise too high.</p><p> </p><p>All programmes that are being implemented undergo a rigorous formal annual review which assesses and records whether funds have been used for their intended purposes and the results that have been delivered. Risks or issues identified during the review are recorded, addressed and monitored. In areas of high risk, particularly in fragile and conflict affected areas, the Department often uses monitoring agents, independent audits, and other additional safeguards.</p><p> </p><p>All organisations who receive funding from DFID have to provide evidence about the use of funds, including through annual audited statements. DFID’s Internal Audit Department provides further checks that programme funding reaches the intended recipients and reviews the work of all overseas offices every two years. This is supplemented by the National Audit Office and the Independent Commission on Aid Impact who provide independent scrutiny over the use of the aid budget.</p>","Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner","Mr Nick Hurd",,"2016-03-29T14:44:42.243Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/480653/answer","Biography information for Mr Nick Hurd","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/480653/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/480653/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-03-18","Overseas Aid","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, what mechanisms are in place to ensure funding from her Department reaches the project for which it is intended.","false","Biography information for David Mackintosh","Northampton South","David Mackintosh","31732"
