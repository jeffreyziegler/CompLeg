This academic year, for example, part-time students are, for the first time ever, able to access full-time equivalent maintenance loans.</p><p>As stated in the government response to the consultation on part-time maintenance loans, we would like to extend these new loans to distance learning courses, but we must maintain confidence in the student finance system and ensure that adequate controls are in place to prevent the misuse of public funds. The department will extend these loans to distance learners only if robust controls are put in place to manage the risks associated with that mode of study. The department is currently considering those controls, and a final decision regarding whether it is feasible to extend maintenance loans to distance learners will be made once this scrutiny is completed.</p><p>Beyond student finance, the National Retraining Scheme is an ambitious, far-reaching programme to drive adult learning and retraining, in order to respond to changes in the economy and support people to progress in work, redirect their careers and secure the higher-paid, higher-skilled jobs of the future, focusing on those individuals that need it most.</p><p>To inform the design of the scheme, the Flexible Learning Fund is supporting 31 pilot projects across England with a total value of £11.4 million. The projects are designing and testing innovative, flexible learning that is easy to access. The pilots are aimed at adults who are working, or who are returning to work, with either low or intermediate skills. A range of delivery methods are being tested; most of the projects will make use of on-line technologies to a degree, as well as ‘blended learning’ that combines online and face-to-face learning.</p><p>​We know that technology can play a really important role in making learning more flexible and adaptive, as well as breaking down the barrier of distance.

The Department has commissioned research to support schools in designing their own assessment policies. The Commission on Assessment Without Levels, the Data Management Review Group, and the Workload Advisory Group have all taken into account the balance that needs to be struck between the burden that assessment can place upon teachers and pupils, and the educational value of effective assessment. Recent research conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) has shown that schools are tailoring their assessment systems to provide support more effectively.</p><p>The Commission on Assessment Without Levels is available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/commission-on-assessment-without-levels" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/commission-on-assessment-without-levels</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The Data Management Review Group is available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teacher-workload-data-management-review-group-report" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teacher-workload-data-management-review-group-report</a>.</p><p>The Workload Advisory Group report: ‘Making data work’ is available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response</a>.</p><p>The NFER research is available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approaches-to-assessment-without-levels-in-schools" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approaches-to-assessment-without-levels-in-schools</a>.</p><p>Ofsted guidance on assessment is a matter for Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Amanda Spielman.

This includes pressing those parties to conflict listed in the UN Secretary-General's annual report on CAAC to enter into concrete action plans with the UN to verify and release any child soldiers associated with armed groups and forces. We apply diplomatic pressure to listed governments and armed groups, and fund projects to help protect and rehabilitate vulnerable children. We also press for the inclusion of child protection in peacekeeping responses through UN mandate renewals and resolutions. The UK is the largest single financial contributor to the office of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) for CAAC contributing £800,000 in the last five years. We have shown our support for the SRSG's recently launched Global Coalition for Reintegration by joining the 'Friends of Reintegration' group, a forum to generate new ideas for supporting reintegration programmes for children formerly associated with armed groups.</p><p>In 2018, the UK endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a political commitment to reduce the impact of conflict on education, and the Vancouver Principles, which aims to ensure that child protection is an operational priority for UN peacekeeping missions. As a member of the Group of Friends of CAAC in Geneva, we also participated in a joint statement to the 37th session of the Human Rights Council in March 2018, in which we reiterated our strong support for the mandate of the SRSG for CAAC.
