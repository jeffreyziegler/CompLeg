Not studying the EBacc prior to age 16 is likely to close down options early by precluding pupils from taking those subjects any further (for example, at A level). They provide a sound basis for a variety of careers beyond the age of 16. These subjects also enrich pupils’ studies and give them a broad general knowledge that will enable them to participate in and contribute to society.</p><p> </p><p>There is evidence that suggests that subject choice at A level directly impacts the under-representation of lower socio-economic groups at high status universities, and that these gaps can be closed by reducing differences in attainment and subject choice at GCSE. The EBacc is therefore key to removing the barriers to ensure that all children are given the same chances through education to succeed.</p><p> </p><p>Since the introduction of the EBacc the proportion of pupils taking this combination of subjects has risen from 22% in 2010 to 38% this year.
