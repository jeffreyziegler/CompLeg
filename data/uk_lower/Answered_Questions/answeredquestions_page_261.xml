For the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the results show that 69.3% of children achieved a GLD compared to 51.7% in 2013.</p><p>The quality of early years provision is also improving with 93% of settings rated by Ofsted as good or outstanding in December 2016 compared to 74% in 2012. Ofsted’s Childcare providers and inspections as at 31 December 2016 statistics are available at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-providers-and-inspections-as-at-31-december-2016" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-providers-and-inspections-as-at-31-december-2016</a>.</p><p>Key to this is a well-qualified workforce with 77% of group based staff in 2016 holding at least a level 3 qualification relevant to childcare and 29% holding at least a level 6. Evidence shows that settings which employ more highly qualified staff are more likely to attract a good or outstanding rating from Ofsted. The Early Years workforce strategy published earlier this month, outlines how we will help employers attract, retain and develop staff to deliver high quality provision. The strategy is available at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-workforce-strategy" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-workforce-strategy</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is working hard to ensure parents and children have access to high quality early years education places through the funded 15 hour entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds and for all three- and four-year-olds. The Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP) provides over £300 per eligible child to support better outcomes for disadvantaged three- and four-year-olds and the Foundation Years website includes good practice examples to help providers decide how to use the EYPP to improve outcomes for the disadvantaged children in their care.

That is why we introduced the National Transfer Scheme for UASC in July 2016. The National Transfer Scheme is a voluntary scheme which is designed to ensure a more equal distribution of UASC across the country and ensure children are given all the support they need. <br> <br> The National Transfer Scheme has also placed unaccompanied children transferred to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 into local authority care. Following a full consultation with local authorities under section 67 local authorities reported they had capacity for 400 places. <br> <br> Every region in England is participating in the National Transfer Scheme and we are working closely with the Devolved Administrations to ensure they are able to accept cases under the National Transfer Scheme.
