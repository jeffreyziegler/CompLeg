All schools are required to promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faith and beliefs. Our guidance published in November 2014 says that British values include accepting that others of different faiths or beliefs to oneself (or having none) should be accepted and tolerated, and should not be the cause of prejudicial or discriminatory behaviour. The guidance can be found online at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-fundamental-british-values-through-smsc" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-fundamental-british-values-through-smsc</a>.</p><br /><p>All publicly funded schools are required to promote community cohesion and teach a broad and balanced curriculum.The curriculum provides many opportunities to foster tolerance and understanding. As part of the history curriculum, pupils could learn about different cultures, and about how different groups have contributed to the development of Britain. The citizenship programme of study sets out a requirement for pupils to be taught about ‘the diverse national, regional, religious, and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom and the need for mutual respect and understanding’. PSHE can teach young people about the rights and responsibilities of living in a diverse community and how to respect others.</p><br /><p>All forms of bullying are unacceptable and all schools are required to have in place a behaviour policy with measures to tackle bullying and they are held to account by Ofsted. Inspectors will look at records and analysis of bullying, discriminatory and prejudicial behaviour, either directly or indirectly, including racist, disability and homophobic bullying, use of derogatory language and racist incidents.</p><br /><p>We have made clear in advice to schools that where bullying outside school is reported to school staff, it should be investigated and acted on.

To support delivery of the strategy, NHS England has appointed Cally Palmer as NHS National Cancer Director.

The guidance is complimented by clinical guidelines <em>on Breast cancer (early and locally advanced)</em> and <em>Breast cancer (advanced)</em> published by NICE in 2009, and <em>Familial breast cancer</em> published in June 2013.</p><br /><p>NICE has also published a quality standard for breast cancer which is designed to drive and measure priority quality improvements in a breast cancer care.

It has produced evidence based service guidance to support commissioners of breast cancer services, which is in the process of review internally.</p><br /><p>The results of the 2014 Cancer Patient Experience survey show improvements in many areas. 89% of all patients reported that their care was either excellent or very good, and breast cancer patients on the whole reported a more positive experience than for many other cancer patients, with 93% reporting having been given the name of a Clinical Nurse Specialist.</p><br /><p>On 13 September, based on the recommendations of the independent Cancer Taskforce report, we announced a number of measures to improve diagnosis, treatment and aftercare of people with cancer. This included a commitment that, by 2020, the 280,000 people diagnosed with cancer every year will benefit from a tailored recovery package.

HMS ENTERPRISE has been deployed since 4 July and she will shortly be joined by HMS RICHMOND with her organic Lynx helicopter, Royal Marines boarding party and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for enhanced surveillance.</p><p>A recently passed United Nations Security resolution, (http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2240(2015), endorses our actions on the high seas under the EUNAVFOR Med operation. The UK was at the forefront of securing this resolution.</p><p>In addition, the UK’s multi-agency Organised Immigration Crime (OIC) Taskforce builds on existing extensive law enforcement capability in the UK and overseas focusing on the crime networks in source countries, transit points including the Mediterranean as well as at the UK border and France. The Taskforce is already working with international partners, actively sharing intelligence and progressing criminal investigations.</p><p>The OIC Taskforce builds on the existing progress made by Immigration Enforcement and others to tackle the gangs that target the most vulnerable. Last year UK law enforcement disrupted more than 170 organised crime gangs involved in immigration crime while so far this year, Immigration Enforcement alone has seen 48 convictions and the disruption of 27 organised crime gangs.</p>","Aylesbury","Mr David Lidington",,"2015-10-22T15:12:30.263Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/421062/answer","Biography information for Sir David Lidington","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/421062/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/421062/answer",,,,,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2015-10-13","Mediterranean Sea: Human Trafficking","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of recent UK efforts to prevent people smuggling in the Mediterranean.","false","Biography information for Andrew Rosindell","Romford","Andrew Rosindell","11684"

ISIL propaganda condones the barbaric treatment of male and female captives, sexual relations with adolescent girls and sexual slavery. Unfortunately, many of those who flee the conflict remain extremely vulnerable to sexual violence.
