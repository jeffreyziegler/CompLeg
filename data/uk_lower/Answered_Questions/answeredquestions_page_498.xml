The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast at the March 2014 Budget that this will be 3.0 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014-15. Forecasts of government expenditure are generally made on a financial rather than a calendar year basis and are presently only available out to 2018-19.The figures to the end of the forecast period are as set out below:</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>2014-15</p></td><td><p>2015-16</p></td><td><p>2016-17</p></td><td><p>2017-18</p></td><td><p>2018-19</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Public sector gross investment as % of GDP</p></td><td><p>3.0</p></td><td><p>2.9</p></td><td><p>2.9</p></td><td><p>2.8</p></td><td><p>2.8</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>PSGI measures the direct spending on infrastructure projects by the whole public sector, unlike other measures such as net investment which are adjusted to exclude certain elements of spending. Internationally comparable figures for PSGI are not readily available. The UK's fiscal framework is based around the entire public sector, many other countries only use a measure for general government that excludes public corporations so these are often the only comparative measures available.

This is vital to ensure clear accountability, roles and responsibilities for helping and protecting adults with care and support needs who are experiencing, or at risk of, abuse or neglect as a result of those needs. Local authorities are given a lead role in coordinating local safeguarding activity.</p><p> </p><p>Following the failure of Southern Cross Healthcare, the Government consulted widely on how to address the issues around the financial failure of large care providers. The Care Act establishes the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as the financial regulator of providers which, because of their size, geographical coverage or specialism, could cause difficulty to local authorities in arranging alternative care in such circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC will look at the finances of these providers and, where there are significant concerns about financial sustainability, take action to ensure a provider is taking steps to return to financial health. Where that is not possible, the CQC will share all the information it has with relevant local authorities, to help them minimise the negative effects should the provider fail and to ensure a smooth process that provides continuing care to individuals.</p><p> </p><p>The aim of this new regime is not to prop up failing providers, but to provide reassurance and co-ordinate continuity of care for people affected should a care business fail. The CQC is currently working to establish this new function, which will begin in April 2015 and sit alongside its role to oversee the quality of providers. In the meantime, the Department has a team overseeing the finances of the five largest providers.</p><p> </p><p>Significant reform is already underway to ensure the CQC is an effective regulator. Chief Inspectors have been appointed, for hospitals, adult social care, and general practice. The CQC is putting in place specialist inspection teams, headed by the Chief Inspectors, to carry out more in-depth inspections that subject providers to greater scrutiny than before.</p><p> </p><p>Under the leadership of the Chief Inspectors and, after a phase of testing, since April 2014 all acute National Health Service trusts inspections have used the new methodology; the inspection reports from this wave were all published by March 2014, three of which produced a shadow rating. The CQC is completing the second wave of inspections and all 13 of the 19 inspection reports already published have a shadow rating. The CQC also began testing its new inspection model in mental health, community services and NHS general practice out of hours services in January 2014 and in adult social care in April 2014.</p><p> </p><p>Subject to Parliamentary agreement, regulations will introduce new fundamental standards as requirements for registration with the CQC. These will allow the CQC to take robust action against providers that do not deliver an acceptable standard of care. The CQC will produce ratings of the quality of care ranging from ‘outstanding' to ‘inadequate', to provide service users with a fuller picture of the quality of care available. The aim is to introduce both sets of regulations in October 2014.</p><p> </p>","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb","199802","2014-06-12T15:09:47.2578193Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/60860/answer","Biography information for Norman Lamb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/60860/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/60860/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-06-09","Care Homes: West Sussex","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he plans to take to implement the recommendations of the Serious Case Review into the private care home sector in West Sussex.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","199801"

The Care Act establishes the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as the financial regulator of providers which, because of their size, geographical coverage or specialism, could cause difficulty to local authorities in arranging alternative care in such circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC will look at the finances of these providers and, where there are significant concerns about financial sustainability, take action to ensure a provider is taking steps to return to financial health. Where that is not possible, the CQC will share all the information it has with relevant local authorities, to help them minimise the negative effects should the provider fail and to ensure a smooth process that provides continuing care to individuals.</p><p> </p><p>The aim of this new regime is not to prop up failing providers, but to provide reassurance and co-ordinate continuity of care for people affected should a care business fail. The CQC is currently working to establish this new function, which will begin in April 2015 and sit alongside its role to oversee the quality of providers. In the meantime, the Department has a team overseeing the finances of the five largest providers.</p><p> </p><p>Significant reform is already underway to ensure the CQC is an effective regulator. Chief Inspectors have been appointed, for hospitals, adult social care, and general practice. The CQC is putting in place specialist inspection teams, headed by the Chief Inspectors, to carry out more in-depth inspections that subject providers to greater scrutiny than before.</p><p> </p><p>Under the leadership of the Chief Inspectors and, after a phase of testing, since April 2014 all acute National Health Service trusts inspections have used the new methodology; the inspection reports from this wave were all published by March 2014, three of which produced a shadow rating. The CQC is completing the second wave of inspections and all 13 of the 19 inspection reports already published have a shadow rating. The CQC also began testing its new inspection model in mental health, community services and NHS general practice out of hours services in January 2014 and in adult social care in April 2014.</p><p> </p><p>Subject to Parliamentary agreement, regulations will introduce new fundamental standards as requirements for registration with the CQC. These will allow the CQC to take robust action against providers that do not deliver an acceptable standard of care. The CQC will produce ratings of the quality of care ranging from ‘outstanding' to ‘inadequate', to provide service users with a fuller picture of the quality of care available. The aim is to introduce both sets of regulations in October 2014.</p><p> </p>","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb","199801","2014-06-12T15:09:47.3671845Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/60861/answer","Biography information for Norman Lamb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/60861/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/60861/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-06-09","Care Quality Commission","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what plans he has to reform the Care Quality Commission.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","199802"

It allows staff to be allocated from prisons with the capacity to provide them, to those where additional staffing is required. On average over the three month period (January to March 2013), less than 1% of staff were provided on detached duty. A large proportion of the capacity is typically available from prisons that are in the process of closure or going through a re-role. This process temporarily releases a number of officers who are not supplied for specific occasions but are sent and received on a shift pattern throughout the week.</p><p> </p><p>The number of staff available for detached duty at any one time is a matter for operational judgement and takes account of overall staff numbers, levels of sickness, prisoner numbers and the regime and security requirements.</p><p> </p><p>The average weekly provision of staff, broken down by grade, that were received as part of the nationally co-ordinated detached duty scheme , are shown in the tables below for January to March 2014.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Table: Average weekly provision of staff on detached duty to prisons in England &amp; Wales, broken down by grade, January - March 2014</strong></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Grade</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>January 2014</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>February 2014</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>March 2014</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Band 3</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>130</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Band 4</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>~</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total</p></td><td><p>210</p></td><td><p>160</p></td><td><p>130</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>We have maintained our policy of rounding figures to the nearest 10 in line with the department's policy for presenting staffing data.

This should lead to increased high risk sex offenders accessing programmes. A greater focus has been placed on higher risk offenders who pose the greatest risk of harm to the public and this therefore requires investment in lengthier more expensive programmes which offer greater benefit to the public.
