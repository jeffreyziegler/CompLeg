The UK is one of the biggest bilateral donors to basic education in low income countries. Between 2010 and 2015 DFID supported 11 million children in school across 21 countries, 7.5 million of them in countries considered to be fragile. DFID has again pledged to support 11 million girls and boys with a decent education between 2015 and 2020. In addition, by 2017, our flagship £355 million Girls’ Education Challenge will enable up to 1 million of the world’s most marginalised girls to benefit from an education of sufficient quality to help transform their lives, including in countries such as Somalia and South Sudan.</p><p>DFID is also supporting initiatives to improve how the international community provides education in emergencies, including conflicts. This includes leadership to establish the ‘No Lost Generation Initiative’ (NLGI) in 2013 to prevent the loss of an entire generation of children to the effects of violence and displacement in the Syria conflict. As part of this support, the UK has allocated £115 million to provide protection, psychosocial support and education for children affected by the crisis in Syria. As a result, over 251,000 children have received formal and informal education inside Syria and in the region, allowing them to catch up on lost learning time and perform well in public school examinations. In addition, a key outcome of the recent ‘Supporting Syria and the Region Conference’, held in London on 4 February, is the commitment that, by the end of the 2016/17 school year,1.7 million children – all refugee children and vulnerable children in host communities – will be in quality education with equal access for girls and boys.</p><p>Ahead of the World Humanitarian Summit in May, DFID is also working with partners to improve how education is delivered globally in humanitarian and protracted crises.</p>","New Forest West","Mr Desmond Swayne",,"2016-03-03T16:06:32.353Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/456204/answer","Biography information for Sir Desmond Swayne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/456204/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/456204/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-02-29","Armed Conflict: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, what steps her Department is taking to support children living in conflict zones to access education.","false","Biography information for Mr Jamie Reed","Copeland","Mr Jamie Reed","28943"
