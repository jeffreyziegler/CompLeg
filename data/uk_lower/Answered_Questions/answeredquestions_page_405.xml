ICD-10 diagnosis codes for diabetes</p><p> </p><p>The following ICD-10 codes were used to identify diabetes:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E10 - Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</p><p> </p><p>E11 - Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</p><p> </p><p>E12 - Malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus</p><p> </p><p>E13 - Other specified diabetes mellitus</p><p> </p><p>E14 - Unspecified diabetes Mellitus</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Hospital Provider</p><p> </p><p>A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust). Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of data flows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using these data as the counts may be lower than true figures.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7) Assessing growth through time (Admitted patient care)</p><p> </p><p>HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely, apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March, e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.</p><p> </p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2015-09-15T15:55:41.277Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/417306/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/417306/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/417306/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-09-07","Orthopaedics: Plymouth","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, how many limb amputations were undertaken in the Plymouth area in each of the last five years; and how many such operations were as a result of (a) smoking and (b) diabetes.","false","Biography information for Johnny Mercer","Plymouth, Moor View","Johnny Mercer","9130"

If adequate reception arrangements are absent, most unaccompanied children are granted temporary leave to remain (UASC Leave) which usually continues until their 18th birthday. When a child passes the age of 18 and their UASC Leave expires, they are no longer considered to be an unaccompanied asylum seeking child and are therefore required to take steps to return voluntarily or seek further leave to remain. If the individual does not seek to regularise their stay through further applications or leave is not granted they may be removed should they fail to leave voluntarily.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/417327","Home Office","false","2015-09-14","<p>The Home Office does not return Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children (UASC) whose claims have been refused, unless adequate reception arrangements are in place in the country to which the child is to be returned. If adequate reception arrangements are absent, most unaccompanied children are granted temporary leave to remain (UASC Leave) which usually continues until their 18th birthday. When a child passes the age of 18 and their UASC Leave expires, they are no longer considered to be an unaccompanied asylum seeking child and are therefore required to take steps to return voluntarily or seek further leave to remain. If the individual does not seek to regularise their stay through further applications or leave is not granted they may be removed should they fail to leave voluntarily.

Staff and prisoners will be able to elect to work or reside in a smoke free area and they will be supported within them. It is a short term measure which provides a proportionate response to the impact of second hand smoke in communal areas.</p><br /><p>In line with Public Health England (PHE) guidance, the importance and significance placed upon the provision of smoking cessation services is critical to our approach. Prisoners with drug problems are currently managed via a balance of medicated maintenance and abstinence based treatment. We will adopt this approach to smoke free. Vaping and the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as an alternative to tobacco smoking are supported by PHE as a harm reduction tool. Research commissioned by PHE concluded that e-cigarettes can help smokers to stop smoking. E -cigarettes have been made available to prisoners and their use is allowed in designated areas. In addition a range of nicotine replacement products and smoking cessation support will be in place to support prisoners attempting to abstain.</p><br /><p>The Government is committed to reducing the supply of drugs into prison. NOMS already deploys a comprehensive range of robust searching and security measures to detect items of contraband both at the point of entry to the prison and concealed within the prison.

In addition to the principal study, three further research studies were commissioned and published by the Department. The Department’s four published reports were formally submitted to the COT for consideration in June 2012.
