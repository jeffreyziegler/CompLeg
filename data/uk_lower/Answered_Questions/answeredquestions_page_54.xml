In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), several factors increase susceptibility to hyperkalaemia including a high dietary potassium intake relative to residual renal function. When patients with CKD have other risk factors, for example treatment with drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the risk of hyperkalaemia is further increased. Clinical presentation of hyperkalaemia is highly variable with some patients presenting with an acute illness whilst others may be asymptomatic.</p><p> </p><p>Although not completely preventable, the risk of developing hyperkalaemia can be reduced. Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults, a collaboration between the Renal Association and Resuscitation Council UK that is endorsed by a range of organisations, including the College of Emergency Medicine and the Faculty of Intensive Care medicine, sets out evidence-based guidance on the management of the condition. It was developed to improve the treatment of acute hyperkalaemia and to reduce the risk of complications associated with hyperkalaemia and its treatment. The main measures in primary prevention in patients with CKD are regular blood monitoring, careful drug prescribing and dietary advice. Patient information and education may reduce the risk of inadvertent hyperkalaemia.

As such, we cannot tell whether an offender is still subject to a community order at the time of their reoffence. Please see the available data in the table provided.</p><p>There is persuasive evidence showing community sentences, in certain circumstances, are more effective than short custodial sentences in reducing reoffending. The MoJ study ‘The impact of short custodial sentences, community orders and suspended sentence orders on re-offending’ published in 2015 involved around 350,000 sentencing occasions over 4 years and used 130 different variables to construct matched groups of offenders and examine the effect of short sentences relative to community sentences. This study found a reduction of around 3 percentage points in proven reoffences if offenders receiving sentences of less than 12 months were to get a community order instead. This is statistically significant and equates to around 30,000 proven reoffences in total over a one-year period.
