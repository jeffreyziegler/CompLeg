"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1142130","Department for Education","false","2019-09-03","<p>Under the 2008 Education and Skills Act, local authorities have a statutory duty to identify and track participation of 16 and 17-year-olds in education or employment with training, to support those who are not participating to do so, and to make sure there is sufficient, suitable education and training provision to meet their needs. Local authorities also have a duty to work with schools to identify those young people who need targeted support or who are at risk of not participating post-16. Alongside this, they must lead the September Guarantee process which guarantees all young people a suitable place in further education at the end of years 11 and 12.</p><p>In line with these duties, where a young person is identified as ‘Not in Education, Employment and Training’ (NEET), the local authority has a responsibility to work with them. Similarly, where a young person’s destination is identified as ‘not known’, the local authority must continue to try to locate and contact the young person through various routes.</p><p>Local authorities may choose to organise their tracking of young people in a variety of ways; however, all local authorities have a duty to submit monthly data to the Department for Education’s ‘National Client Caseload Information System’ (NCCIS). This data is then published by the department, throughout the year in various publications, for transparency purposes.</p><p>The department publishes the NEET scorecard annually, which pulls together all of the NCCIS data published throughout the previous year and other relevant data. The scorecard ranks local authorities into 5 groups based on their performance on the percentage of 16 and 17-year-olds NEET and whose activity is not known. The department actively performance manages those local authorities in the bottom group. These actions can vary from engagement at official level, meetings and ministerial letters.</p><p>As this year’s scorecard has yet to be published, it will not be possible to confirm at this time exactly what action will be taken with individual local authorities. However, as local authority groups will be based on the NCCIS NEET and participation data, published on 20 June 2019[1], which shows that Lancashire County Council’s NEET and not known percentage is 10%, of which 8% were not known, which is above the North West average of 3.2% and the England average of 2.9%, it is likely that performance management action will be taken in relation to Lancashire local authority.</p><p>The department’s performance management approach has worked well in the past, with the majority of the local authorities contacted achieving improvements in their submitted data. Where improvements are not achieved, in a reasonable timeframe, the department follows up at official level with formal meetings to agree action plans and deadlines for improvement.</p><p> </p><p>[1] NEET and Participation Local Authority Figures: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/neet-and-participation-local-authority-figures" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/neet-and-participation-local-authority-figures</a>.</p>","Saffron Walden","Mrs Kemi Badenoch",,"2019-09-03T11:46:53.373Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1142130/answer","Biography information for Mrs Kemi Badenoch","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1142130/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1142130/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-07-25","Apprentices and Further Education: Lancashire","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he plans to take to ensure that 16 and 17 year olds in Lancashire classed as not known in respect of their education, training or employment status by Lancashire County Council's internal scrutiny committee are identified and helped into further education and apprenticeships.","false","Biography information for Graham P Jones","Hyndburn","Graham P Jones","282301"

Part of this settlement includes over £700 million more for the special educational needs and disabilities budget in 2020-21 compared to this year, which is equivalent to an increase of over 11%.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, the settlement also includes £1.5 billion in each of the next 3 years for teachers’ pensions.
