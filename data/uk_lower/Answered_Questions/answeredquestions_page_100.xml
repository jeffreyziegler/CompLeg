The school should assess the child, plan an intervention if a learning difficulty is identified, implement the intervention and then review the outcome and progressively repeat this cycle until the child’s learning difficulty is properly supported.

To do this we will make a comparison between the total amount of all relevant existing benefits to which the claimant was entitled at this point and the total amount of Universal Credit to which the claimant would be entitled as calculated based on the same set of circumstances. If the entitlement to the existing benefits is the greater amount then the difference will be awarded as a Transitional Element. When awarded, this Transitional Element will be taken into account with any other applicable Elements to determine a claimant’s Universal Credit award in each Assessment Period.</p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1002762/answer",,,,,,"2018-12-13T14:37:05.053Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1002762/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1002762/answer","Reading West","Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1002762/answer/previousversion/84612","Biography information for Alok Sharma","29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-11-06","Universal Credit","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what funding the Government has allocated for transitional payments for people moving onto universal credit; and by what process claimants will receive such payments.","true","Biography information for Chris Stephens","Glasgow South West","Chris Stephens","188877"
