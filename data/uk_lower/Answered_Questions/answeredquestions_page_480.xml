Such individuals are among our primary counter-terrorism concerns.<br><br>For those individuals who are at risk of radicalisation, agencies such as the police and local authorities work together to assess the nature and the extent of the risk and, where necessary, provide an appropriate support package tailored to individual needs. <br><br>We advise against all travel to Syria; anyone who does so is putting themselves in considerable danger. We have held community events in mosques and universities to dissuade people from travelling to Syria and to help Syrian people in other ways, emphasising that Syrians themselves have been clear that they do not want foreigners to come to their country. The best way for the public to help is to donate to orotherwise support UK registered charities that have ongoing relief operations.<br><br>Where an individual intends nonetheless to go to Syria, there are a number of tools at our disposal to disrupt travel. In some cases we can use the Royal Prerogative to withdraw passports. We also use powers to question people at borders to determine whether they are involved with terrorism. The Pre-Departure Checks Scheme is in place to identify those who pose a terrorist or terrorism-related threat and prevent them from flying to and from the UK. Where individuals have left the UK, we work with international partners to disrupt onward travel. <br><br>If there is evidence that people are going to Syria to engage in terrorist activity they can be arrested and prosecuted. Each case is considered individually; if the police refer a case to the Crown Prosecution Service, they consider whether there is sufficient evidence of any offence, and if so, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute.<br><br>As the Prime Minister announced in the House on 1 September, this Government is seeking to strengthen our ability to meet the unprecedented scale of this threat. The proposed new counter-terrorism powers include:<br><br>* Specific and targeted legislation to provide the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border, during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned.<br>* If there is any judgment that threatens the operation of our existing powers to revoke passports, introducing primary legislation immediately so that Parliament, not the courts, can determine whether it is right that we have this power.<br>* A targeted, discretionary power to allow us to exclude British nationals from the UK.<br>* Putting our long-standing arrangements on aviation security around the world on a statutory footing. Airlines will have to comply with our no fly list arrangements, give us information on passenger lists and comply with our security screening requirements.<br>* Putting our de-radicalisation programme, called Channel, on a statutory footing.<br>* New powers to add to our existing Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, including stronger locational constraints on suspects under TPIMs – either through enhanced use of Exclusion Zones, or through relocation powers.

It also gives them the opportunity to learn skills and a work ethic which can increase their chances of finding employment on release, a key element to reducing reoffending.</p><p> </p><p>The number of prisoners working in industrial activity reported by public sector prisons increased from around 8,600 in 2010-11 (the first year for which figures are available) to around 9,900 in 2013-14. This delivered an increase in the total hours worked in industrial activities from 10.6 million hours to 14.2 million hours, as published in the <em>National Offender Management Service Annual Report 2013-14: Management Information Addendum </em> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/prison-and-probation-trusts-performance-statistics-201314" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/prison-and-probation-trusts-performance-statistics-201314</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Private sector prisons have also been supporting this agenda and have reported that they delivered over 1½ million prisoner working hours in commercial and industrial workshops in 2012-13 which provided work for over 1,200 prisoners.</p><p> </p><p>An establishment-level breakdown of the average number of prisoners is set out in the table attached for the years 2010-11 to 2013-14, alongside the average population and the proportion of population that were working in industrial activities at each public sector prison site.</p><p> </p><p>The variation between levels of industrial activity at each site is influenced by a number of factors, chiefly by the category and role of the prison and the types of prisoner available to work. For example the transient nature of the prisoner population in local establishments, as well as the requirements of commercial customers, mean that this is a more challenging, and often less suitable environment into which to introduce work.</p><p> </p><p>The physical capacity of prisons – primarily available space and operating environment – is an additional limiting factor. Many prisoners were built without large work shops.</p><p> </p><p>These differences in capacity and capability are reflected in prison Service Level Agreements and in the performance framework; establishments with higher capacity and capability to deliver industrial activity will have higher target hours and this will carry a higher weighting in the prison rating system than for establishments with lower levels of capacity.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to industrial work, prisoners also take part in a large number of other activities including education, training and offending behaviour programmes. There are also a large number of prisoners who work in areas that contribute to the upkeep of the prison, for example food preparation and serving as well as cleaning.</p><p> </p><p>Prison Rule 31 (1) specifies that a convicted prisoner shall be required to do useful work for not more than 10 hours a day and arrangements shall be made to allow prisoners to work, where possible, outside the cells and in association with one another.</p><p> </p><p>The regime in prisons is changing for convicted prisoners as NOMS implements the benchmark core day and the opportunities it provides to extend the working day as well as the potential to increase time in other activities including education. To support this, recreational activities will take place outside the main working part of the day.</p><p> </p><p>Under our reforms to the Incentives and Earned Privileges national policy framework, came into effect in adult prisons on 1 November 2013, prisoners are expected to engage in purposeful activity, as well as demonstrate a commitment towards their rehabilitation, reduce their risk of reoffending, behave well and help others if they are to earn privileges.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-10-21T16:49:57.67678Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89802/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89802/answer","Prisoners Working in Industrial Activities.xls","Prisoners Working in Industrial Activities.xls","Prisoners Working in Industrial Activities","Prisoners Working in Industrial Activities","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89802/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-08-29","Prisons: Employment","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many and what proportion of prisoners in each prison in England and Wales were working in industrial activity in each year since 2010-11.","false","Biography information for Mr Ben Bradshaw","Exeter","Mr Ben Bradshaw","207329"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79643","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","false","2014-08-18","<p>The Commission of Inquiry made nineteen recommendations to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) (para 1220, (a) – (s)); six for China and other States in the context of trafficking and forced repatriation of refugees (para 1221 (a) – (f)); one relating to inter-Korean relations (para 1222); two directed at states, civil society organisations, foundations and business enterprises (1223 and 1224) and ten to the international community and the United Nations (1225 (a) – (j)).</p><p>The recommendations relating to trafficking and forced repatriation do not apply directly to the UK. However, we have been clear with the Chinese government and others that we believe that people who have escaped from the DPRK are entitled to protection and should be allowed safe passage to resettlement in third countries.</p><p>Para 1223 relates to people-to-people dialogue and contact in areas such as culture, science, sports, good governance and economic development. As one of the few countries with a presence on the ground in Pyongyang, the UK can play a particular role in implementing this recommendation. We already seek to expose North Koreans to the outside world through the British Council English language training programme and other engagement activities.</p><p>Para 1224 recommends that states and others should support the work of civil society organisations to improve the human rights situation in the DPRK, including efforts to document violations and to broadcast accessible information into each country. The UK has previously funded projects with South Korean non-governmental organisations related to documenting violations in the DPRK. We have also worked with international and domestic organisations within the DPRK to improve the treatment of disabled people. Our focus on direct engagement complements that of others, like the US, who support broadcasts into the DPRK.</p><p>With regard to the recommendations for the international community and the United Nations, my noble friend, the former Senior Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Baroness Warsi), set out in detail in her reply on 23 July (Official Report, column GC461) the UK’s position on the recommendations for the UN Security Council (para 1225(a)) and our commitment to ensuring that the international community takes action in response to the Commission’s report (para 1225(f)). The recommendations in para 1225 (b) and (c) have been taken forward through the UN Human Rights Council and those in (d), (e) and (g) are primarily for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Secretariat. We are currently exploring the prospects for taking forward para 1225(h), which recommends forming a human rights contact group. Para 1225(i) relates to provision of humanitarian assistance. The UK does not have a bilateral aid programme in the DPRK, but agrees fully with points made in this recommendation about how such assistance should be provided. Para 1225(j) recommends the convening of a high-level political conference to consider a final peaceful settlement to the Korean War. A comprehensive resolution of the situation on the Korean peninsula will require the DPRK to address the international community's legitimate security concerns.</p>",,"Baroness Anelay of St Johns",,"2014-08-18T10:02:12.8887507Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79643/answer","Biography information for Baroness Anelay of St Johns","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79643/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79643/answer",,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2014-07-28","North Korea","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the reply by Baroness Warsi on 23 July (HL Deb, cols GC 460–4) on the Commission of Inquiry Report on human rights in North Korea, how many of the Commission’s recommendations that pertain specifically to Her Majesty’s Government have been implemented thus far; and whether there are any recommendations that they do not intend to implement.","false","Biography information for Lord Alton of Liverpool",,"Lord Alton of Liverpool","HL1535"

Sanctions are designed to impose a cost for Russia’s actions in Ukraine, deter further escalation of this crisis, and support the wider diplomatic effort. EU measures already announced have exacerbated negative trends in Russia’s economy; capital flight in the first half of 2014 was greater than for the whole of 2013; and we have seen a significant reduction in expected growth. Russian access to western financial markets will be severely constrained as lenders consider the risks of Russian exposure in the current climate. The strengthening of sanctions should signal clearly to the Russian leadership that their policy of trying to destabilise Ukraine will have a cost for the Russian economy.
