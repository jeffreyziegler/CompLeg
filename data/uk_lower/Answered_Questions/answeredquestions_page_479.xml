Launched at The Wireless Festival, the campaign encouraged 16-24 year-olds to spend more time in the shade when the sun is strong.</p><p>In addition, between 2010-11 and 2013-14 the Department provided Cancer Research UK with £459,000 to test innovative approaches to influence young people to take action to prevent melanoma and help men from lower socio-economic groups report early stage melanoma. This included the R UV Ugly campaign, to raise awareness of the dangers of sunbeds and the benefits of skin checks in young women. The Department also funded Cancer Research UK to produce a primary care skin cancer recognition toolkit and to run a sun protection tracking survey to continue to measure awareness of skin cancer and the risks in the general public.</p><p>We know that using sunbeds significantly raises the risk of skin cancer, particularly in younger people. Laws are in place to prevent under 18s from using sunbeds in commercial premises and businesses can be fined up to £20,000 for not complying. Local authorities are responsible for enforcing this.</p><p>Public Health England ran a local <em>Be Clear on Cancer</em> pilot campaign in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset from 16 June to 27 July 2014 to raise awareness of the signs of skin cancer.

If you notice any persistent or unusual changes to your skin, tell your doctor”. The campaign leaflet also informed people how to avoid sunburn and reduce their chances of getting skin cancer.</p><p>This pilot was tested on a small, local scale first (using local radio, press, and outdoor advertising) to ensure that campaign messages are correct for the target audience and to assess the impact on National Health Service services.

Under the current conditions of the REACH restriction, there is a derogation to allow for limited use of lead based paint in the restoration and maintenance of historic buildings and artwork. Those intending to use lead based paint must provide a declaration of the intended use to both the supplier and to the relevant competent authority before any work commences.</p><p>Further protection is afforded by the Control of Lead at Work Regulations (CLAW) 2002. These Regulations apply to activities involved in the application of lead based paint in permitted circumstances as described above and also to refurbishment work such as maintenance of buildings, where the removal of lead based paint can create risks of exposure.</p><p>Under CLAW duty holders are required to make a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, including identifying whether lead based paint or other lead-containing material is present. Informed by that assessment, duty holders must identify, and implement adequate control measures to minimise the exposure of workers to inhalable lead particles and ensuring high standards of personal hygiene.

The increase in the threat level is related to developments in Syria and Iraq where terrorist groups, including ISIL, are planning attacks against the West. ISIL <br>is a clear national threat to the UK, as it is a global threat to our international partners and the region. We believe that more than 500 individuals from the UK have travelled to Syria since the start of the conflict. It is estimated half of these have returned. We judge that a significant minority of UK extremists currently fighting in Syria are affiliated with ISIL. British citizens fighting with proscribed terrorist organisations would clearly pose a threat to the UK should they return. Such <br>individuals are among our primary counter-terrorism concerns.<br><br>The Government is taking steps to counter this unprecedented threat. On Wednesday 26 November, we introduced the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill, in order to extend the powers available to our law enforcement and intelligence <br>agencies. This Bill will ensure that we can: disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight, as well as their ability to return here; enhance our ability to monitor and control the actions of those in the UK that pose a threat; and combat the underlying ideology that feeds, supports and sanctions terrorism. It includes provisions to:<br><br>The powers set out in the Bill are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.<br><br>This legislation will provide additional tools to compliment work already underway to tackle the threat from ISIL under a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism led strategy. <br><br>We must take action at home – but we must also have a comprehensive strategy to defeat these extremists abroad. This involves using all the resources at our disposal – humanitarian efforts, which Britain is already leading, to help <br>those displaced by ISIL’s onslaught, and diplomatic efforts to engage the widest possible coalition of countries in the region as part of this international effort. At the UN, we are leading the process of condemning <br>ISIL, disrupting the flows of finance to ISIL and forging a global consensus about preventing the movement of foreign fighters.<br><br>This strategy also involves political efforts to support the creation of a new and genuinely inclusive government in Iraq and to bring about a transition of power in Syria that can lead to a new representative and accountable government <br>that can take the fight to ISIL.<br><br>We are determined to defeat the ideology of all forms of extremism, not just violent extremism. So we are banning preachers of hate, proscribing organisations that incite terrorism and stopping people from inciting hatred in <br>our schools, universities and even our prisons. For those individuals who are at risk of radicalisation, agencies such as the police and local authorities work together to assess the nature and the extent of the risk and, where <br>necessary, provide an appropriate support package tailored to individual needs. And we are working with industry to remove more extremist online material than ever before to protect those British young people vulnerable to becoming <br>radicalised. Since the start of this government, the Counter-Terrorism Internet Referral Unit has secured the removal of 65,000 items from the internet that encouraged or glorified acts of terrorism. More than 46,000 of these have been <br>removed since December last year.

The programme has provided subject knowledge training to a level that would be required to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS) to qualified teachers who did not train in their SKE subject.</p><p> </p><p>The Department for Education’s vision is to work with schools to develop an education system in which teacher and leadership training, continuous professional development (CPD) and school-to-school support are delivered locally by partnerships led by the best head teachers. We are encouraging schools to find local solutions to their particular challenges and supporting teaching school alliances (TSAs) and system leaders to deliver innovative solutions to drive up standards. In line with this vision, NCTL are no longer funding HEIs in 2014-15 and instead are running a test and learn project with 45 teaching school alliances. TSAs will be responsible for designing and delivering post ITT SKE provision, focusing on secondary maths, physics, chemistry, computing, MFL and primary maths to meet their local/regional need. How they deliver the project and the subject they choose to focus on is entirely their decision and we expect to see a diverse range of approaches building on existing partnerships.

Domestic and non-domestic consumers will have near-real time information on their energy consumption to help them control their energy use, and avoid wasting energy and money. Smart metering can transform the prepay experience. Topping up a smart meter in prepay mode should become as easy as topping up a mobile phone. New products and services will be supported in a vibrant, competitive, more efficient market in energy and energy management.</p><p>Suppliers will have access to accurate data for billing and to improve their customer service. They will also be able to reduce costs, for example by reducing call centre traffic, removing the need for a site visit to read meters and better manage debt.</p><p>Energy networks will have better information upon which to manage and plan their activities and smart meters enable smart grids which support sustainable energy supply.</p><p>Energy suppliers will be responsible for purchasing and installing smart meters. Energy suppliers and other energy industry participants, such as network operators, will also incur costs as part of upgrades to their systems and for Data and Communications Company services, so that they are able to take full advantage of smart metering.</p><p>As is the case with traditional meters, the Government expects that both costs and cost savings as a result of smart metering will be passed to consumers by competing energy suppliers through energy bills. We estimate that this is will result in energy bill reductions as a result of smart metering of £26 a year by 2020, rising to around £43 per household a year by 2030, for the average dual fuel domestic consumer – taking into account all the costs and savings.</p><p>The Impact Assessment, updated in January 2014, provides further details of these benefits and costs:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-meter-roll-out-for-the-domestic-and-small-and-medium-non-domestic-sectors-gb-impact-assessment" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-meter-roll-out-for-the-domestic-and-small-and-medium-non-domestic-sectors-gb-impact-assessment</a>.</p>","West Suffolk","Matthew Hancock","207543","2014-09-08T14:58:32.3286927Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89582/answer","Biography information for Matt Hancock","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89582/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89582/answer",,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2014-08-29","Energy: Meters","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, with reference to the policy document entitled, Helping households to cut their energy bills, supporting pages on smart meters, updated online on 24 July 2014, who incurs the costs of £10.9 billion for the installation of smart meters in homes.","false","Biography information for David T.

New products and services will be supported in a vibrant, competitive, more efficient market in energy and energy management.</p><p>Suppliers will have access to accurate data for billing and to improve their customer service. They will also be able to reduce costs, for example by reducing call centre traffic, removing the need for a site visit to read meters and better manage debt.</p><p>Energy networks will have better information upon which to manage and plan their activities and smart meters enable smart grids which support sustainable energy supply.</p><p>Energy suppliers will be responsible for purchasing and installing smart meters. Energy suppliers and other energy industry participants, such as network operators, will also incur costs as part of upgrades to their systems and for Data and Communications Company services, so that they are able to take full advantage of smart metering.</p><p>As is the case with traditional meters, the Government expects that both costs and cost savings as a result of smart metering will be passed to consumers by competing energy suppliers through energy bills. We estimate that this is will result in energy bill reductions as a result of smart metering of £26 a year by 2020, rising to around £43 per household a year by 2030, for the average dual fuel domestic consumer – taking into account all the costs and savings.</p><p>The Impact Assessment, updated in January 2014, provides further details of these benefits and costs:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-meter-roll-out-for-the-domestic-and-small-and-medium-non-domestic-sectors-gb-impact-assessment" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-meter-roll-out-for-the-domestic-and-small-and-medium-non-domestic-sectors-gb-impact-assessment</a>.</p>","West Suffolk","Matthew Hancock","207542","2014-09-08T14:58:32.2193171Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89585/answer","Biography information for Matt Hancock","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89585/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/89585/answer",,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2014-08-29","Energy: Meters","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, with reference to the policy document entitled, Helping households to cut their energy bills, supporting pages on smart meters, updated online on 24 July 2014, who receives the benefits of £17.1 billion for the installation of smart meters in homes; and what form those benefits take.","false","Biography information for David T.

The UK is committed to supporting Nigeria and its neighbours tackle the wider threat from Boko Haram. On 12 June we hosted a ministerial meeting for Nigeria, its neighbours and international partners in London which agreed measures to strengthen regional cooperation against Boko Haram. These measures included establishing a regional intelligence fusion cell and coordinated border patrols. The UK also approved bilateral support including military and intelligence cooperation. On 3 September I visited Nigeria, where I met both President Jonathan and Foreign Minister Wali. In those meetings I expressed the UK's deep sympathy for the plight of the school girls and discussed further measures for securing their release.

For example, data on one-year survival from all cancers and one-year survival from breast, lung and colorectal cancer were published as part of the CCG outcomes indicator set for the first time on 19 June 2014. NHS England is continuing to monitor the progress of the NHS in reducing mortality from cancer in line with the NHS Outcomes Framework, and from 2014-15 there will be a range of new NHS Outcomes Framework indicators reflecting different stages of diagnosis which will provide a good proxy measure in future on progress in delivering earlier stage of diagnosis of cancer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Mandate for the NHS for 2014-15 sets out an ambition for England to become one of the most successful countries in Europe at preventing premature deaths.

For example, results from the first national “Be Clear on Cancer” lung cancer campaign in 2012 showed that around 700 extra patients were diagnosed with lung cancer compared to the previous year. Approximately 400 of these patients had their lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage, with around 300 more patients having surgery, giving them a better chance of survival.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NHS England took over responsibility for the annual national cancer patient experience survey from April 2013.
