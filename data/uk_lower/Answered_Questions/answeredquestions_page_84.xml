This is directing resources where they are needed most, providing transparency and predictability for schools, and addressing historic disparities between areas. For example, Coventry received £510 more per pupil than Plymouth despite having equal proportions of pupils eligible for free school meals and Nottingham similarly attracted £555 more than Halton. These disparities had persisted for nearly a decade, with little or no justification.</p><p>Under the NFF, the basic per pupil funding amount for Key Stage 4 pupils is £4,386. Pupils may also attract additional funding through other NFF factors or through other funding streams, such as the pupil premium. Pupils in areas which face higher labour costs will also have the per pupil amount they attract increased by the relevant area cost adjustment, in recognition of those costs.</p><p>To provide stability for schools, local authorities continue to be responsible for designing the distribution of funding in their areas. Because of this, local authorities can continue to set their own base funding rates for Key Stage 4 pupils, which can vary from the figure above.</p><p>Before 2018-19, the Department did not distinguish between key stages when allocating funding to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant. Each local authority will have set their own funding rates for Key Stage 4 pupils for each year in this period.</p><p>Students who take A levels typically do so as part of 16 to 19 study programmes. The Department does not separately identify the per student funding rate for students taking A levels rather than other qualifications in their study programmes. The base rate of funding for 16 to 19 study programmes is £4,000 per year for full-time 16 and 17-year-old students. Additional funding is provided on top of this through the 16-19 funding formula, to cover, for example, the needs of disadvantaged students, and to provide extra funding support for high attaining students who study four or five A levels. The £4,000 rate has been in place since the current formula was introduced in 2013.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2019-01-15T17:51:40.6Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038030/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038030/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038030/answer","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb","Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038030/answer/previousversion/94841","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038030/answer/previousversion/94841","Biography information for Nick Gibb","60","Education","Education","2019-01-08","Pupils: Per Capita Costs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what the average per pupil funding rate was for (a) GCSE students and (b) A-level students in each year since 2010.","false","Biography information for Neil O'Brien","Harborough","Neil O'Brien","206470"

We do not have statistics to demonstrate a causal link between illicit phones and drug misuse but we know that illicit mobile phones can be used for a variety of harmful purposes by criminals in prison, including to organise the supply of drugs. The use of mobile phones in prisons is an important cog in the infrastructure that supports and fuels crime and violence. Consequently, we are improving our security to restrict the availability of both drugs and mobile phones. We use body, property, cell and area searches, metal-detecting scanners and drug and phone detection dogs across the estate. We have recently invested an additional £7 million in modern technology, including extending the use of phone blocking technology and improved searching techniques. We are also investing £6 million to tackle drug supply and reduce demand in 10 of the most challenging prisons, with body scanners and more staff focused on effective searching.</p><p>To reduce the demand for illicit mobile phones, we are also expanding the roll-out of in-cell telephones. Currently, 20 public sector prisons have in-cell phones. We are now investing a further £10 million to roll-out in-cell phones to a further 30 prisons by March 2020. Calls can only be made to pre-agreed numbers and can be monitored, with governors able to remove phones from those who misuse them. We know that maintaining prisoners’ family ties is hugely important too, with prisoners who receive contact from their family while in prison 39% less likely to reoffend. This will enable prisoners to maintain relationships with their family and access talking support services, in a managed and secure way, while we continue to take action to restrict the supply of illicit phones.</p>","Penrith and The Border","Rory Stewart",,"2019-01-16T16:18:58.03Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038044/answer","Biography information for Rory Stewart","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038044/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1038044/answer",,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-01-08","Prisons: Drugs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment his Department has made of the effect on drug consumption rates in prisons of inmates having access to phones.","false","Biography information for Andrew Rosindell","Romford","Andrew Rosindell","206286"

NINos may therefore include short-term migrants (those entering the UK for less than 12 months) who will not be included in LTIM estimates. LTIM estimates will include people (such as students) who come to the UK for reasons other than work and don’t register for a NINo, so are not included in NINo data.</p><p>Further publications about improving the evidence[3] and the migration statistics transformation programme[4] include further information about how ONS is developing the evidence base on migration.

We have taken a number of steps to deliver this aim: this year, we launched the digitally-led Simple Energy Advice service to provide impartial, tailored advice on how homeowners can cut energy bills and make their homes greener, and also launched a new quality mark, through Trustmark, to help give consumers confidence in the quality of the measures being installed in their homes. And, in April 2018, we introduced new legislation requiring landlords of both residential and commercial buildings to improve their properties to Energy Performance Certificate Band E or higher. We will also shortly publish an action plan on building the market for energy efficiency, outlining a range of market-based measures in line with this aspiration.</p><p> </p><p>Alongside this, the Energy Company Obligation obligates the larger energy suppliers to install energy efficiency and heating measures to people’s homes to help reduce their energy use. Since January 2013, the scheme has delivered over 2.4 million improvements in around 1.9m homes. It is funded at £640m per year and this level of support will continue to 2028, meaning the Government will drive more than £6 billion of investment in domestic energy efficiency over the next ten years.</p><p> </p><p>The Clean Growth Strategy also set out our ambition to enable business consumers to reduce their energy usage by improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2030. We have introduced a more streamlined energy and carbon reporting framework to help businesses reduce their carbon emissions and associated energy costs. We have also launched a new £18 million Industrial Heat Recovery Support Programme supporting the recovery and re-use of industrial waste heat, and committed £8.8 million to promote innovative approaches to energy management using smart meters. We also announced at Budget 2018 up to £315m for an Industrial Energy Transformation Fund to support businesses with high energy use to invest in energy efficiency and decarbonisation measures, and that we would bring forward proposals on a new energy efficiency scheme for small and medium sized enterprises.</p>","Devizes","Claire Perry",,"2019-01-15T14:58:24.927Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037104/answer","Biography information for Claire Perry","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037104/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037104/answer",,,,,,,,,"201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2019-01-07","Energy: Conservation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, what steps his Department is taking to help consumers reduce their energy usage.","false","Biography information for David Simpson","Upper Bann","David Simpson","205875"

Gambling operators who advertise in the UK must comply with the advertising codes, which aim to ensure gambling advertising does not target or appeal particularly to children or young people. TV adverts must be pre-cleared by Clearcast and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) acts on complaints and proactively checks the media to take action against misleading, harmful or offensive advertisements. The Gambling Industry Code for Socially Responsible Advertising requires all TV and print adverts to carry an 18+ or ‘no under 18s’ message.</p><p> </p><p>As with advertising, sponsorship arrangements must be socially responsible and must never be targeted at children. Operators’ logos must not appear on any commercial merchandising which is designed for children, including replica football shirts in children’s sizes.</p><p> </p><p>Our Review of Gaming Machines and Social Responsibility Measures set out a package of measures to strengthen protections further. These include tougher guidance from the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP) on protecting vulnerable people, with further guidance on children and young people due soon, tougher sanctions for operators who breach advertising codes and a multi-million pound safer gambling advertising campaign, which will include responsible gambling messages around sports.</p><p> </p><p>The gambling industry and broadcasters have announced additional initiatives to limit the advertising seen around sport. The Industry Group for Responsible Gambling will amend its advertising code to include a ‘whistle-to-whistle’ ban on all TV betting adverts during pre-watershed live sport, including for 5 minutes before and after play. It has announced that the changes are expected to come into effect in summer. Sky will also offer customers the option to opt out of TV gambling adverts from 2020. These are welcome steps by industry to respond to public concerns, and it is important that all those who benefit from gambling advertising think about how they can be socially responsible. We will continue to monitor issues around advertising and consider any new evidence carefully.</p>","Eastleigh","Mims Davies",,"2019-01-15T15:46:36.28Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037162/answer","Biography information for Mims Davies","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037162/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037162/answer",,,,,,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2019-01-07","Gambling: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, what steps his Department is taking to limit children’s exposure to gambling adverts during sporting events.","false","Biography information for Dr Rosena Allin-Khan","Tooting","Dr Rosena Allin-Khan","205999"

However, the Government has consistently made clear that many EU and UK businesses and public sector organisations rely on the free flow of personal data to fulfil their obligations and therefore maintaining the free flow of personal data is a priority for the Government.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Data Protection Act 2018 updated the UK’s rules in accordance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and transposed the Law Enforcement Directive, ensuring our data protection laws will be aligned with those of the EU at our point of exit. We are confident that we will strike a positive relationship on data. The UK and the EU start from a position of trust in each other’s standards and regulatory alignment on data protection. As set out in the Political Declaration, the EU will begin its assessment of the UK as soon as possible after the United Kingdom's withdrawal, endeavouring to adopt decisions by the end of the implementation period. The UK is ready to begin those assessments.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to prioritising an early adequacy decision, it is the job of a responsible Government to prepare for the possibility that we leave the EU without an adequacy agreement in place. On 13 December the Government and the Information Commissioner's Office published detailed information and guidance on data protection in the event that this were to happen. DCMS is engaging with businesses across all sectors of the economy, including the digital sector, to mitigate risks to disruption of international data transfers. In recognition of the unprecedented degree of alignment between the UK and EU’s data protection regimes, the UK would at the point of exit continue to allow the free flow of personal data from the UK to the EU.</p>","Stourbridge","Margot James",,"2019-01-10T17:05:13.09Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037220/answer","Biography information for Margot James","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037220/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1037220/answer",,,,,,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2019-01-07","Digital Technology","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, what assessment he has made of the potential effect on the UK’s digital sector of the UK leaving the EU without an adequacy agreement to ensure uninterrupted UK-EU data transfers.","false","Biography information for Liam Byrne","Birmingham, Hodge Hill","Liam Byrne","205834"

It provides continuity of relationships and care arrangements, enabling care leavers to benefit from a stable and secure family setting, and to prepare for independence at a more gradual pace, rather than facing a ‘cliff-edge’ at age 18.</p><p>The government keeps the Staying Put policy under constant review, including through monitoring data from local authorities on take-up by young people, engagement with the sector, and reviewing information from Ofsted inspections of local authorities. Staying Put was also considered as part of the independent fostering review undertaken by Sir Martin Narey and Mark Owers, published in February 2018.</p><p>The latest data show that increasing numbers of care leavers are living in Staying Put arrangements. In the year ending March 2018, 55% of 18-year-olds chose to Stay Put, which is an increase of 4% on 2017. Furthermore, the data show that 31% of 19-year-olds, and 26% of 20-year-olds were still living with their former foster carers, which represent increases on the previous year.</p><p>In 2018 to 2019 the government provided £23.3 million to local authorities to implement Staying Put, with a further £23.77 million committed for 2019 to 2020.

These financial sources can be used to contribute to the cost of providing the Staying Put arrangement, in a similar way that young people who are still living at home with their parents may contribute to the costs of running the household.</p><p>The government does not believe a foster carer’s approval should automatically lapse after 12 months if they are a Staying Put carer.

This builds on the real progress we have made since the publication of chapter one in 2016, particularly in reformulation of the products our children eat and drink most. Chapter two sets a bold ambition to halve childhood obesity by 2030 and significantly reduce the gap in obesity between children from the most and least deprived areas by 2030. We have reiterated this ambition in our vision document ‘Prevention is better than cure’ published in November 2018.</p><p> </p><p>Many of the key measures in both chapters of our childhood obesity plan will have an impact on tackling obesity across all age groups. These include the soft drinks industry levy, sugar reduction and wider calorie reformulation programme, restricting promotions and calorie labelling in restaurants which will improve our eating habits and reduce the amount of sugar we consume.</p><p> </p><p>‘Healthier You: The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme’ started in 2016 and has reported that 280,763 individuals at risk of developing type 2 have been referred into the service and 123,249 individuals have now had an initial assessment. In 2018/19 the Programme achieved full national roll out, with services now available to people in every sustainability and transformation partnership in England, making England the first country in the world to achieve full geographical coverage.</p><p> </p><p>It was recently announced that NHS England intends to double the capacity of Programme to up to 200,000 people per annum by 2023/24.
