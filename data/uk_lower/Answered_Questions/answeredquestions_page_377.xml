The government is aware of the concerns that parents may have about content and inappropriate or upsetting behaviour on social media</p><br /><p>We have produced advice for parents on how to prevent their child from being cyberbullied, spot signs that they are being targeted and what to do if they are. The Government Equalities Office is funding the UK Safer Internet Centre to produce advice for schools on how to keep children safe online. This is scheduled for publication next spring. The advice for parents can be found online at GOV.UK:</p><p>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/444865/Advice_for_parents_on_cyberbullying.pdf</p><br /><p>We are providing £1.3 million this financial year (2015-16) to anti-bullying charities to tackle all forms of bullying including cyberbullying on top of the £4m provided over the period 2013-15. We are also providing £2 million this financial year (2015-16) to organisations to specifically tackle homophobic bullying.</p><br /><p>Every school is required by law to have a behaviour policy with measures in place to prevent all forms of bullying including cyber-bullying. In July 2015, the Department published the “Keeping Children Safe in Education” guidance for schools and colleges and this can be found online at GOV.UK: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2</a></p><br /><p>All schools and colleges must have regard to this statutory guidance when carrying out their duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The guidance sets out that governing bodies and proprietors should consider how children may be taught about safeguarding, including online, through teaching and learning opportunities, as part of providing a broad and balanced curriculum. This may include covering relevant issues through personal, social health and economic education (PSHE), and/or through sex and relationship education (SRE) in maintained schools and colleges.</p><br /><p>From September 2014, e-safety has been taught at all four key stages of the curriculum in England. It covers responsible, respectful, and secure use of technology, as well as ensuring that pupils are taught age-appropriate ways of reporting any concerns they may have about what they see or encounter online. Children and young people are being taught about the different and escalating risks they may encounter as they get older (initially relating to online content, then to the conduct of and contact with others, which can include sexting).</p><br /><p>Schools can help to contain cyber-bullying and social media abuse and sexting during the school day by banning or limiting the use of mobiles and other electronic devices. In addition search powers included in the Education Act 2011 have given teachers the power to search for, and if necessary delete, inappropriate images (or files) on electronic devices, including mobile phones.</p><br /><p>The effectiveness of schools and FE colleges in managing behaviour and tackling bullying is assessed as part of Ofsted inspections. In reaching a judgement on personal development, behaviour and welfare, inspectors will evaluate the extent to which provision supports pupils and students in understanding how to keep themselves safe from relevant risks such as abuse, sexual exploitation and extremism, including when using the internet and social media’</p><br /><p>The Longitudinal Study of Young Peoplein England(LSYPE) published by my Department in November 2015 compared bullying among two cohorts of 14 year olds (year 10 students)from 2004 and 2014. This shows that, while there is clearly much more to do, thanks to the efforts of teachers and charities30,000fewer peoplein year 10said they had been bullied in the lasttwelve months.

NOMS has also reviewed case management process for prisoners assessed as being at risk and will be acting on the recommendations in due course.</p><br /><p>The national statistics on safety in custody use the following categories: self-harm incidents are defined as “any act where a prisoner deliberately harms themselves irrespective of the method, intent or severity of any injury”; and self-inflicted deaths are defined as “any death of a person who has apparently taken his or her own life, irrespective of intent.” They do not include a separate category of “attempted self-inflicted death”, because the intent of the prisoner is often unknown.

Further information on these proportions can be found at</p><p>http://www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf</p><p>The alcohol attributable fraction is set to 1 (100%) where the admission is considered to be entirely due to alcohol, e.g. in the case of alcoholic liver disease - these records are described as wholly alcohol attributable.</p><p>The alcohol attributable fraction is set to a value greater than 0 but less than 1 according to the NWPHO definition, e.g. the alcohol fraction of an admission with a primary diagnosis of C00 - malignant neoplasm of lip, where the patient is male and between 65 and 74 is 0.44 - these records are described as partly alcohol attributable.</p><p>These wholly and partly attributable fractions can be aggregated to supply an estimate of activity which can be considered wholly or partly attributable to alcohol.</p><p>Partly alcohol attributable fractions are not applicable to children under 16. Therefore figures for this age group relate only to wholly-attributable admissions, where the attributable fraction is one.</p><p>The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated but is not currently available from HES.</p><br /><p>[2]Finished admission episodes</p><p>A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider.

Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice.

As part of our strategy to reduce the incidence of such infections, we have tightened the regulatory aspects in England by revising the Health and Social Care Act Code of Practice on the prevention and control of infections in July 2015. The revised Code strengthens links and references to antimicrobial resistance within primary and secondary care.

This enables regulators such as the Care Quality Commission to look at compliance with the Code within its inspection programme.</p><br /><p>At the same time, we have ensured that a range of guidance and tool kits have been produced to support healthcare staff to manage carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae and other resistant bacteria.
