The Maritime and RAF Reserves are most often used to provide individuals and small teams for specific roles. Their training is designed to integrate them with the Regulars.</p><p>We have streamlined the process for transferring from the Regulars to the Reserves to enable people with key skills to share their knowledge and expertise. We are also actively working to identify any policy or process issues that may hinder the use of reservists and to remove these barriers wherever possible.</p><p>We have developed a set of indicators of culture change and we have put in place a process through which the Services will assess their progress against these indicators and provide evidence of that progress to senior leadership in the Department. This will allow the Ministry of Defence to identify and share examples of good practice as well as issues to be addressed.</p><p>These initiatives have begun to have a positive effect. In the 2016 Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey, almost two thirds of Regulars who had served alongside Reservists rated them as professional, with a similar number rating the Reserves' contribution as valuable.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/714478","Ministry of Defence","false","2017-04-18","<p>The Armed Forces constantly strive to sustain and improve the response rates for the three Continuous Attitude Surveys (CAS). We do this in various ways, including by reducing the burden on respondents by ensuring that the number of questions is minimised and that they are written in a straightforward way. We also ensure that the surveys reach their intended audience by tracking their distribution and using nominated points of contact at unit level to assist with the distribution of surveys and with communications. Units are given their individual response rates so they can gauge where they rank against other units and the chain of command is held responsible for maximising response rates.</p><p>The Department and the chain of command provide clear messages about the importance of responding to the surveys and we also ensure that the most convenient methods for responding to the survey are available to respondents, including opening up the surveys to be completed online. In addition, Service personnel, some of whom do not have regular access to IT systems, have the option of completing a paper survey.</p><p>Our approach is supported by an integrated CAS communications strategy with various communication methods employed, both centrally and through each of the Services. Messages are communicated using various channels including through announcements on the Ministry of Defence and single Service intranet sites, and regular adverts on British Forces Broadcasting Services. There has been an increased emphasis on social media for the 2017 surveys, including the use of Twitter. Use is also made of relevant networks and publications to spread communications more widely, for example through Soldier magazine and the Service Families Federations. The importance of participation in the CASs and the actions taken as a result, are included in Senior Command briefings. Email and postcard reminders are sent out to coincide with other communication efforts.</p><p>Each survey has a Service infographic summarising key findings, and these are included in communications as well as standalone posters. In addition, all findings from the CASs are published on the gov.uk website.</p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster",,"2017-04-18T15:21:04.977Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/714478/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/714478/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/714478/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2017-03-28","Armed Forces: Surveys","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what steps his Department is taking to increase response rates (a) to the armed forces, (b) families and (c) the reserves Continuous Attitude Survey.","false","Biography information for Nia Griffith","Llanelli","Nia Griffith","69631"
