"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424497","HM Treasury","false","2015-11-05","<p>Tobacco fraud is a highly organised global crime which costs the UK £2.1 billion a year in lost taxes. Cross border collaboration is an essential part of HMRC’s tobacco anti-fraud strategy which has resulted in significant reductions in the illicit trade. The strategy is kept under regular review as the challenges posed by the cross-border illicit trade in tobacco evolve. The joint HMRC and UK Border Force strategy for tackling illicit tobacco has been refreshed and was published on 24 March 2015. It is available via the following link:</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/418732/Tackling_illicit_tobacco_-_From_leaf_to_light__2015_.pdf" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/418732/Tackling_illicit_tobacco_-_From_leaf_to_light__2015_.pdf</a></p><br /><p>The strategy sets out how HMRC are working with other enforcement agencies in the UK and overseas to target, catch and punish those involved. It also includes the establishment of a cross-government ministerial group to oversee future evolution of the anti-illicit tobacco strategy. The strategy builds on the considerable success made in reducing the UK illicit cigarette market from 22% in 2000 to 10% in 2014/15, and from 61% to 35% for hand-rolling tobacco over the same period.</p><br /><p>In Northern Ireland there is a well-established Cross-border Fraud Enforcement Group covering tobacco fraud. The aim of the group is for law enforcement partners to share intelligence and work collaboratively, harnessing all available resources to tackle the illicit trade across the border. This multi-agency tobacco group is chaired by HMRC with representation from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the National Crime Agency (formerly SOCA), the Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><br /><p>This is a highly effective enforcement group which is producing significant results. In the last year (2014/15) joint cross border tobacco operations have led to seizures of 38 million cigarettes, 11 tonnes of raw tobacco, 4.5 tonnes of shisha tobacco, a tobacco processing machine, 12 arrests and significant amounts of cash.</p><br /><p>More recently, in the Summer Budget 2015, the Government announced measures that will increase by 50% HMRC’s capacity to investigate and prosecute Organised Crime Groups dealing in illicit tobacco. They will also expand HMRC’s intelligence network, strengthening activity in high risk areas overseas, on the near continent and in the UK.</p><br />","East Hampshire","Damian Hinds",,"2015-11-05T15:23:54.8Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424497/answer","Biography information for Mr Damian Hinds","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424497/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424497/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2015-10-28","Tobacco: Smuggling","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, what steps HM Revenue and Customs are taking to stop tobacco smuggling in Northern Ireland.","false","Biography information for Tom Elliott","Fermanagh and South Tyrone","Tom Elliott","13783"

The number and nature of the apprenticeship opportunities available depends on what employers offer, but we are supporting this by doubling public funding for apprenticeships since 2010, supporting employers in developing clear new apprenticeship standards, and introducing a levy on employers to fund further growth. Our aim is that there should be three million new apprenticeship starts by 2020.</p><br /><p>Across adult education as a whole, it is important that there is the right supply of places to meet future demand. Determining what this supply should be is not something central government can take the lead on. In September the government announced a programme of area reviews, which will be locally led and will involve key stakeholders. They will be based on the best available evidence of skills requirements and establish a local post-16 education and training offer which is high quality and responsive to employer need. The reviews will support local involvement in the ongoing commissioning of provision, putting responsibility in the hands of people who are best placed to tailor provision to local economic needs. Croydon will be included in the area review process, which is due to be completed by March 2017, and an announcement on the date for the review will be announced in due course.</p><br /><p>There is also a role for Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) in ensuring that adult education reflects future economic development.

The new statutory framework ensures that support is focused on needs and aspirations, enabling all pupils, including those with autism, to achieve better outcomes in education and adult life.</p><br /><p>Changes to the SEND system since September 2014 include the publication of ‘local offers’ of SEND services by local authorities; the introduction of streamlined education, health and care needs assessments and plans; and new statutory protections for young people aged 16-25 in further education.</p><br /><p>The Act also makes provision to ensure that parents, children and young people are able to access impartial information, advice and support about the SEND system through a local, dedicated and easily identifiable service. Among other things, this service offers help in preparing for meetings with schools, health professionals, or other agencies.</p><br /><p>The Department’s Free Schools programme has seen nineteen special free schools open across the country. This includes several free schools that are specifically for children with Autism, such as the Rise free school in Hounslow, the Lighthouse free school in Leeds, and the National Autistic Society’s Church Lawton free school in Cheshire. There are a further eleven special free schools due to open in the future, five of which will specialise in provision for children with autism, including the Heartlands Autism free school in Haringey and a second National Autistic Society free school, the Vanguard free school in Lambeth. The other six will also offer some places for children with autism.</p><br /><p>The Department has contracted with the Autism Education Trust (2015-16) to deliver autism training to education professionals. The Trust has now trained almost 80,000 education staff since 2012. The Department is also providing grant funding for two additional projects (2015-16): a project by the National Autistic Society to provide information and advice to parents and professionals on exclusions; and a project by Ambitious about Autism on strategies for supporting the transition from school to college.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson",,"2015-11-04T17:07:39.637Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424270/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424270/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/424270/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2015-10-27","Children: Autism","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking to support children and young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder in the education system.","false","Biography information for Dr Lisa Cameron","East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow","Dr Lisa Cameron","13710"
