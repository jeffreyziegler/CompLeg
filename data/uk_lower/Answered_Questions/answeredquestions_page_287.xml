No system can guarantee to detect every individual at risk of mental health problems. Nevertheless, measures are in place to increase awareness at all levels.</p><p>Mental health support to members of the Armed Forces includes pre and post-operational stress management training, a wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments, and initiatives such as Trauma Risk Management. We currently have 16 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs), which are located to be convenient for major centres of military population, and which support the provision of healthcare that is available through Service primary care facilities. In-patient care is provided in dedicated psychiatric units through a central contract the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has with a partnership of eight NHS Trusts, led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust.</p><p>The Armed Forces Covenant makes it clear that all members of the Armed Forces community deserve to receive the very best support and care that we can offer and it is vital to ensure that they are not disadvantaged when accessing healthcare, including treatment for mental health needs.</p><p>Civil Service Employee Policy provides a central health and well-being service to support departments in their well-being work. In 2015, the People Board agreed a strategic approach to health and well-being for the Civil Service. This identified mental health as a key priority. This strategic approach was developed into a Strategic Action Plan, which has now been successfully implemented.</p><p>The MOD has its own bespoke Employee Wellbeing Service that offers support to Civilian employees who experience mental health problems. Wellbeing Consultants are fully trained to provide support and information on a wide range of issues. We also offer a range of tools and information for employees who are experiencing mental health problems.</p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster",,"2016-12-19T15:57:46.09Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/657054/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/657054/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/657054/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-12-12","Ministry of Defence: Staff","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what measures his Department has in place to support those of its staff who have mental health problems.","false","Biography information for Helen Whately","Faversham and Mid Kent","Helen Whately","57217"
