The ACOPs were reviewed and revised in 2014 in consultation with the diving industry.

The Commercial Diving Projects Inland/Inshore ACOP applies to all work in the wind sector that doesn’t fall under the Commercial Diving Projects Offshore ACOP.</p><p> </p><p>Diving qualifications are transferable between sectors if the type of diving being undertaken in the particular sector is covered by the diving qualification held. A diver with a qualification appropriate for working in the offshore oil and gas industry would be able to work in the offshore wind industry. However, a diver holding a qualification for certain work in the wind industry may find that they need extra training before they can work in the offshore oil and gas industry.

Following publication of the last set of survey results in June 2016, NHS England held a consultation on the future of the VOICES survey to seek views on the approach and relevance of the survey to ensure that it remained fit for purpose. Whilst the response showed that the VOICES survey remained a valuable tool, key amongst its findings were that the majority of respondents indicated that the VOICES survey would be more helpful if the sample size were made large enough to report at a local commissioner level.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following this, work was undertaken to revise the survey and consider approaches to a larger sample size and then put in place arrangements to re-commission the VOICES survey. NHS England has been involved in discussions with the Office for National Statistics, which collects the death registration data used to identify survey recipients, about arrangements for access to the data for the new survey. Changes to the safeguarding arrangements on data-sharing, designed to ensure any concerns about care raised via the survey can be appropriately investigated, have resulted in delays to commencing the new VOICES survey. Work is ongoing to resolve this matter, and a timetable for the publication of the next survey cannot be provided at this time.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, there are other means through which personalisation and choice at the end of life are assessed and monitored; for example, through the Care Quality Commission’s inspection regime, which now rates end of life care as a core service, and via the National Audit for Care at the End of Life, commissioned on behalf of NHS England by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2018-06-05T13:35:06.36Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/910187/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/910187/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/910187/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-05-23","Palliative Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, by what means his Department collects information on the preferences for care for people at the end of life since the discontinuation of the National Survey of Bereaved People (VOICES) after the publication of 2015 data.","false","Biography information for Sarah Champion","Rotherham","Sarah Champion","147456"

Those paying the levy decide how the funds in their accounts are used and there are a number of measures in place to support smaller employers and encourage them to offer apprenticeships.
