The UK has also called publicly on Israel to take steps towards the transfer of authority over Area C to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian development in Area C is essential for a sustainable Palestinian economy, yet only 1% of Area C is zoned for Palestinian construction and a large portion of this land is already built-up. The UK will therefore continue to press Israel to ease the current restrictive permitting regime and to transfer control of Area C to the Palestinian Authority as per the Oslo accords. The Israeli Non-Governmental Organisation Peace Now has identified the building and demolition decisions in Area C. Between 2000 and 2007 the Israeli Civil Administration approved only 91 of 1,624 Palestinian applications. During the same period Israeli settlers built over 18,000 homes in the same area.

The Safety Improvement Plan builds on the pledges the organisation set out when joining. The pledges are expanded in more detail in the plan, which sets out what the organisation wants to achieve and by when. Each organisation is expected to demonstrate how they will measure the local impact of their aims over the next three years via a measurement section within their plans.

The measurement and evaluation of the impact at a regional and national level will be led by NHS England working with NHS Improving Quality as part of the integrated measurement strategy for both the campaign and the Patient Safety Collaborative programme.

Patient Safety Incidents occurring in the National Health Service are reported to the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) whose primary purpose is to enable learning from patient safety incidents. The NRLS was established in late 2003 as a largely voluntary scheme for reporting patient safety incidents, and therefore it does not provide the definitive number of patient safety incidents occurring in the NHS. However, from 1 April 2010 it became mandatory for all providers registered with the Care Quality Commission (including all NHS trusts and foundation trusts) in England to report all serious patient safety incidents to the Care Quality Commission. To avoid duplication of reporting, providers of NHS services are encouraged to report all incidents resulting in death or severe harm to the NRLS which then reports them to the Care Quality Commission.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At present, more than 100,000 patient safety incidents (including those resulting in no harm) are reported to the NRLS each month. However, these data are collated on a quarterly, rather than monthly basis. Detailed breakdowns on incidents reported are published twice-yearly and can be accessed via the following link:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/collections/quarterly-data-summaries/" target="_blank">http://www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/collections/quarterly-data-summaries/</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The most recent spreadsheet providing quarterly data for the number of patient safety incidents reported to the NRLS from October 2003 to June 2014 is attached.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NRLS is a dynamic reporting system, and the number of incidents recorded as occurring at any point in time may increase as a greater proportion of incidents are reported.

It highlights how we will change the way frontline health services respond to self-harm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the revised Public Health Outcomes Framework, we have introduced a new indicator that is specifically about self-harm. Under this indicator, we will measure:</p><p> </p><p>- attendances at emergency departments for self-harm per 100,000 population;</p><p> </p><p>- percentage of attendances at emergency departments for self-harm that received a psychosocial assessment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This two-part indicator helps us not only understand the prevalence of self-harm but also how emergency departments are responding. This information can then inform future commissioning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines make it clear that anyone who attends an emergency department for self-harm should be offered a comprehensive assessment of their physical, psychological and social needs. In 2004, NICE published a clinical guideline on self-harm. This covered the short-term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care. It sets out the care people who harm themselves can expect to receive from healthcare professionals in hospital and out of hospital; the information they can expect to receive; what they can expect from treatment and what kinds of services best help people who harm themselves. Following on from this guideline, in November 2011, NICE issued a clinical practice guideline on the longer-term management of self-harm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We expect general practitioners to refer people who disclose self-harm for psychological support as appropriate. We are investing £54 million over the period 2011 – 2015-16 in the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT) programme which is giving children and young people improved access to the best evidenced mental health care. This includes Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for emotional disorders such as anxiety and depressive disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Achieving Better Access to Mental Health Services by 2020</em> contains the first waiting time standards for mental health.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It announces the introduction of improved investment in specialist intensive psychiatric mental health facilities for children and young people to reduce waiting times for intensive psychiatric care and to end the practice of young people being admitted to mental health beds far away from where they live or from being inappropriately admitted to adult wards. It announces the introduction of standard waiting times for Early Intervention in Psychosis services which will be of benefit to young people, and for the adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. It makes it clear that the waiting time standards announced are a first step. There will also be £30 million increased investment in liaison psychiatry to help people including young people presenting in accident and emergency departments with mental health problems. The vision is for comprehensive standards to be developed over the coming years for all ages, including for children and young people. However, where adult IAPT services are commissioned to provide a service to 16 and 17 year olds, the waiting time standard will apply to all those attending the service, regardless of their age.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Preventing suicide in England: A cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives</em> was published on 10 September 2012 to coincide with the International Association for Suicide Prevention’s World Suicide Prevention Day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department, through the National Institute for Health Research and the Policy Research Programme has invested significantly in mental health research and will continue to support high-quality research on suicide, suicide prevention and self-harm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Suicide Prevention Strategy, <em>Preventing suicide in England: A cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives</em> is backed by £1.5 million funding, through the Policy Research Programme, which is supporting six projects to help us better understand key aspects of suicide and self-harm, including looking at self-harm in young people and the role of the internet and social media.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The new e-portal – MindEd – launched in March 2014 includes content on self-harm, suicide and risk in children and young people.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Notes</em></p><p> </p><p><sup>1</sup>Finished admission episodes.
