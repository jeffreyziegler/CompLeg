The 12-month percentage change in the index is published on a monthly basis. The table below summarises the average 12-month percentage change for each of the last five years.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Table 1: Annual average percentage 12-month change, CPIH, UK, 2013 to 2017</strong></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Year</p></td><td><p>Annual average 12-m change (%)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>2.3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>1.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p>0.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016</p></td><td><p>1.0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p>2.6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>These data are taken from Table 10 of our <em>Consumer Price Inflation </em>bulletin[1]. In this publication you will also find the 12-month CPIH inflation rates, and similar figures for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI, the Monetary Policy Committee’s current inflation target). CPIH is the same as CPI but includes Council Tax and a measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs, which are not included in CPI. CPIH and CPI are both National Statistics.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not currently produce an inflation measure for Northern Ireland. This is because the price sample is optimised at the national level and therefore regional price samples are small. Nevertheless, I do recognise that there is an important user need for regional measures of inflation, and to address this ONS have asked the University of Southampton to carry out a feasibility study into calculating regional price indices[2].</p><p> </p><p>You may also be interested to know that ONS analysis suggests that prices in Northern Ireland were on average 2.3% lower than the UK average for 2016. (Note that this analysis refers to the relative difference in price between regions, which is distinct from the rate at which prices change over time).
