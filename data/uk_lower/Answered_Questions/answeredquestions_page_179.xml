"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834748","House of Commons Commission","false","2018-02-13","<p>During 2017 a review of the operating model for guided tours at Parliament was undertaken. This was because the contract with the current supplier of guides for paid-for tours (Blue Badge Guides) comes to an end in October 2018. Blue Badge Guides are not the only option on offer to the public, so therefore a holistic review of all guided tours at Parliament was undertaken. The review sought to make improvements to the current model, and to ensure Parliament gets value for taxpayers’ money across all its tour guiding activities. This includes democratic access (Member tours), currently delivered by in-house guides, and paid for tours on Saturdays and during recess periods.</p><p>The review recommended a change to the current model. At present, different types of tour are taken by separate guide pools, all on different rates of pay and with variable contractual relationships with Parliament. The new model will create a core team of House employed, full-time and part-time tour guides who are able to deliver all tours, including both income generating commercial tours and constituents’ tours booked through Members. These will be good quality jobs, and ensure that visitors have an excellent experience. Blue Badge Guides could apply for the posts in the new House Service.</p><p>This recommendation was approved by managers in both Houses and subsequently endorsed by the Administration Committee on 27 November 2017 and the House of Commons Commission on 18 December 2017. The House of Lords Services Committee endorsed the recommendation following their meeting on 23 November 2017.</p><p>The benefits that will be realised through the adoption of the new model are:</p><ul><li>The opportunity to build a dedicated team of specialists who will be ambassadors for Parliament.</li><li>The operating model will provide substantive full and part time roles for new and existing staff who will be able to access the full employment benefits of working at the Houses of Parliament – rather than outsourcing at a significantly higher cost. Furthermore, the use of casual contracts will cease.</li><li>Visitor Services will introduce new recruitment strategies to increase the diversity of the guide pool. Visitor Services are looking into options such as apprenticeships to offer further employment opportunities.</li><li>The new model represents better value for money by both achieving efficiencies (cost and operational) and enabling opportunities for further public engagement through a richer programme of talks, tours and events with a dedicated Parliamentary team.</li><li>There will be more opportunity to quality assure all types of tour to the same high standard – commercial and democratic – with greater management control, ensuring content is distinct by tour type and audience in order to deepen public engagement with Parliament.</li><li>The above benefits will be realised whilst achieving a modest financial saving in comparison to the current model. This saving will be reinvested to increase Parliament’s public engagement in Westminster and in constituencies.</li></ul><p><br>The new model operating model will come into effect by the end of October 2018.</p><p>The above applies to the operating model only, it does not affect the booking process for tours.</p>","Carshalton and Wallington","Tom Brake",,"2018-02-13T11:45:31.843Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834748/answer","Biography information for Tom Brake","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834748/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/834748/answer",,,,,"18","House of Commons Commission","House of Commons Commission","2018-02-01","Members","1","House of Commons","To ask the right hon.

The Expert Working Group conducted a comprehensive, scientifically robust and independent review of all available scientific evidence relating to hormone pregnancy tests including the responses to a public call for evidence. In reaching its conclusion that, taking all aspects into consideration, the available evidence did not support a causal association between the use of hormone pregnancy tests during early pregnancy, the Expert Working Group made a number of forward-looking recommendations to further strengthen the scientific evidence which supports safety monitoring of medicines in pregnancy. The current focus of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is on implementing these recommendations.</p><p>The Government’s priority, as always, is the safety of patients. While there are no plans to fund independent scientific research into hormone pregnancy tests (which have not been available since 1978), should any further evidence emerge of direct relevance to hormone pregnancy tests the MHRA will evaluate this.
