This should take account of specific challenges facing each area, which could include a dispersed, rural population.</p><p> </p><p>STPs have been in the public domain for several months. Partner organisations within each area are engaging both rural and urban communities on their plans and, where required by law, consulting on service change.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England and NHS Improvement continue to provide ongoing support to each STP area. In September 2016, they published <em>Engaging Local People: A guide for local areas developing Sustainability and Transformation Plans</em>, which set out how STP areas should reach out to stakeholders in their areas. A copy of the guidance is attached.</p><p> </p><p>The NHS is exploring ways to better adapt health provision for rural areas. For example, the vanguard covering Morecambe Bay Health Community is improving healthcare in a geographically isolated area by using a high definition telemedicine link between a general practitioner (GP) surgery in Millom and the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department in Barrow-in-Furness. This means when GPs can seek a second opinion as to whether a patient needs intensive treatment or can be treated in the community – they can call through and have an A&amp;E specialist examine the patient. This means that over the 1,000 square miles that Morecambe Bay covers, patients can have access to expert opinion without having to travel further than their nearest GP.</p><p> </p><p>On 31 March, <em>Next steps on the NHS Five Year Forward View</em> was published by NHS England. The document outlined a 10-point care and efficiency plan which will further contribute to improving the health outcomes of those living in rural areas.

The interior is by no means original, having been altered and changed over the centuries. All parishes that wish to alter their church interiors are required to seek advice and permission from a variety of bodies before a reordering can take place. Parishes undertaking such large scale reordering schemes do not therefore do so lightly. The usual reasons are that the interior no longer serves the needs of the parish and worshiping community. This appears to have been the case at St Botolph’s where members of the congregation need wheelchair access.</p><p>The Church Buildings Council of the Church of England were asked to advise the local Diocesan Advisory Committee in Peterborough when the scheme was initially proposed in 2015 and were supportive of the change. The alterations proposed make reasonable adjustments to the building, which will facilitate the smoother operation of services, funerals and weddings. They will also enable the priest to face the congregation during services, provide wheelchair access and offer a larger children’s area.</p><p>When considering potential alterations, the Church and the Diocesan Consistory Courts must balance the needs of the congregation and parish against any architectural merit the existing furniture or layout may have. When a reordering is done well it often brings with it very positive opportunities for community and congregation to offer new facilities, events and activities, which ultimately bring the Church back to its original purpose to be a space for all in the local community.</p>","Meriden","Dame Caroline Spelman",,"2017-04-18T12:17:27.573Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/715574/answer","Biography information for Dame Caroline Spelman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/715574/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/715574/answer",,,,,"9","Church Commissioners","Church Commissioners","2017-03-30","St Botolph's Church Peterborough","1","House of Commons","To ask the right hon.
