Further progress for England only was recently published by PHE in <em>Hepatitis C in England 2018 report: Working to eliminate heptatis C as a major public health threat</em>. Copies of these reports are attached.</p><p> </p><p>These progress reports have shown that the United Kingdom is on target to meet the WHO interim goal of reducing hepatitis C mortality by 10% by 2020. Better access to improved treatment and prioritising patients with highest unmet clinical need has led to the first fall in deaths from severe hepatitis C related liver disease in a decade.</p><p> </p><p>Assessing the impact Operational Delivery Networks directly have on the incidence of infection is a challenge as this is difficult to measure. Most proxy indicators of incidence suggest that that numbers of new hepatitis C cases have remained relatively stable over recent years.</p><p>Successful delivery of treatments, alongside the contributions of other public health services such as needle exchange and opioid substitution services, will have an effect on incidence. Ongoing monitoring of trends of identification of new cases, and of overall annual prevalence, will continue to be important.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",,"Lord O'Shaughnessy",,"2018-05-03T10:50:43.427Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/887328/answer","Biography information for Lord O'Shaughnessy","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/887328/answer","HCV_in_the_uk_report_2017.pdf ; HCV_in_England_2018.pdf","HCV_in_the_uk_report_2017.pdf ; HCV_in_England_2018.pdf","Hepatitis C in the UK 2017 Report ; Hepatitis C in England 2018 Report","Hepatitis C in the UK 2017 Report ; Hepatitis C in England 2018 Report","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/887328/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-04-19","Hepatitis","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what progress the Operational Delivery Networks have made against the Hepatitis C 2020 Impact Targets set out in the World Health Organisation’s Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis 2016–21 and Appendix 1 of the Hepatitis C in England 2017 report.","false","Biography information for Baroness Randerson",,"Baroness Randerson","HL7125"

This has been a constant theme of our engagement with the Saudi authorities. The UK played a leading role in persuading the Saudi-led Coalition to ease access restrictions on Hodeidah and Saleef ports, imposed after a Houthi ballistic missile was launched at Riyadh on 4 November. During the recent visit to London of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, the UK and Saudi Arabia reaffirmed their commitment to work together to strengthen the inspection mechanism of the UN's Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) to ensure that all Yemeni ports can remain fully open to commercial and humanitarian supplies. The UK is providing £1.3 million this financial year to UNVIM, and has deployed UK maritime experts to Djibouti to boost the inspections process.
