These processes are applied consistently to all outbound and inbound mail carried on behalf of the DWP and citizens. These policies and operating procedures underpin Royal Mail’s operating licence and universal service obligation. Where contracted to do so, Royal Mail also undertakes Security Screening services to identify any potential threats to specific Department sites prior to final delivery. This extends to the security screening services specifically provided to the Department’s Caxton House site in London.</p><p> </p><p>The majority of the Department’s inbound mail (posted by citizens of the UK) is diverted to two central processing locations in the West Midlands. While there are no additional measures in place prior to the consolidation of inbound mail, each and every item of mail is subject to the same rigorous standards and duty of care as it is handled through the Royal Mail network from physical collection at DWP sites (or Post Boxes &amp; Post Offices) through to outward processing and final delivery.</p><p> </p><p>All items carried by Royal Mail on behalf of the Department and citizens are subject to ‘Inviolability &amp; Interception of Mail Policy’ which dictates that once a postal packet is in the transmission of post (i.e. from posting until delivery) it cannot be delayed, opened or removed from the course of post. This policy is underpinned by the following legislation.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Section 104 of the Postal Services Act (PSA) 2000 - Whilst in the course of transmission by post, a letter, packet, parcel or mail bag and/or their contents is immune from “examination, seizure or detention as it would have if it were the property of the Crown.”</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Section 125(3) of the PSA 2000 - A postal packet shall be taken to be in course of transmission by post from the time of its being delivered to any post office or post office letter box to the time of its being delivered to the addressee”.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Section 125(1) of the PSA 2000 - Postal Packets are any letter, parcel, packet or other article transmissible by post.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Royal Mail’s security procedures cover each and every activity undertaken within the Royal Mail pipeline.</p><p> </p><p>Royal Mail deploys a rigorous vetting process for new recruits. This process includes pre-employment checks including a criminal record check before employment commences. Royal Mail provides all of its people with mail security induction training and regular security communications around compliance with security procedures, policies and standards.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to preliminary recruitment processes and on-going coaching to all employees, Royal Mail also supports its service obligations through maintaining a dedicated security team, experienced in security risk management, intelligence gathering, criminal investigation and prosecution. This team also works with a number of law enforcement agencies, Government bodies and industry groups to protect the integrity of the mail.</p><p> </p><p>Royal Mail actively encourages its people to be vigilant for any suspicious activity and report any cases where they believe letters may have been intercepted to both Royal Mail and the Police.</p><p> </p><p>Engie</p><p> </p><p>Engie receives mail from Royal Mail and processes on behalf of the Department at two centralised MOUs. These MOUs have external and internal security systems in place that are subject to annual review and approval by the Department and include systems for both physical and information security.</p><p> </p><p>External security - Both MOUs meet and exceed the accreditation standard required by the Department. Each of the MOUs are audited annually by an external independent company and are accredited to ISO27001 from an information security perspective, which covers client information as well as the physical security of both MOU sites.</p><p> </p><p>The units feature external perimeter fencing with remote controlled access for all inbound and outbound deliveries or collections, which run alongside a centrally controlled access swipe access system for all staff. External CCTV is monitored 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.</p><p> </p><p>Internal security - All staff are cleared through Disclosure Scotland checks prior to commencing work. CCTV is operational 24 hours a day. All visitors must provide identification on arrival and are escorted by an MOU staff member at all times during the visit.</p><p> </p><p>Suspect Packages - Training and guidance is provided to all mail handling staff, with remedial training completed annually.
