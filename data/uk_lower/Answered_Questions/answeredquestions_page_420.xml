Five of the closed court buildings which have not been disposed of are either under offer or on the market. Of those which have not yet been brought to the market, four court buildings have shared locations with the police which means the future of the building is tied in with the Police Station, one has a flying freehold issue and the other three were closed recently. We are working on bringing all of them to the market as soon as possible.</p><p>There are temporary costs associated with making sure unused buildings are kept secure, protecting the fabric of the building and property rates payable to local councils. In addition, decommissioning the buildings to make them ready for sale results in some costs which cannot be disaggregated from the overall running costs. However, these are significantly lower than the costs of running the courts when open, which will have included estates costs, staffing costs and the cost of the judiciary. On average the estates running costs alone for these courts are now more than £4,000 lower per month, almost £50,000 less a year, than when the courts were open.

A third and final review in 2013 commended the systematic way in which ONR had taken into account previous recommendations and the significant progress made in many areas, including on engagement with licensees, assessment of emergency preparedness and response capability, and regulatory guidance. A progress mission to the UK was carried out in November 2014, which concluded that the majority of the recommendations could be closed. The 2014 IRRS report also commented that ONR’s progress “represents a significant achievement and demonstrates the UK and ONR’s commitment to high standards of nuclear safety and the benefits of the IRRS process.”</p><p>Further steps have been taken by the Government to strengthen the UK regulatory regime in the Energy Act 2013, which established the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) as an independent statutory corporation. The Energy Act 2013 also included steps to increase the transparency of nuclear regulation and the accountability of the organisation more generally by statutory requirements to publish and lay before Parliament a five year strategy, an annual plan, an annual report and accounts and for directions made by my rt. hon. Friend the Secretary of State to be laid before Parliament. Additionally, the ONR publishes an annual assurance statement by the Chief Nuclear Inspector, as part of its annual report and accounts, which is designed to provide independent assurance to the public about the delivery of ONR’s regulatory functions.</p><p>The UK regulatory arrangements are considered an example to other countries. At the 5<sup>th</sup> Review Meeting of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management in May 2015, the UK regulatory approach to risk reduction and remediation at Sellafield was recognised as ‘good practice,’ meaning a practice that makes a significant contribution to safety and is applicable to other states with comparable programmes of hazard reduction.</p>","South Northamptonshire","Andrea Leadsom",,"2015-06-30T15:37:18.833Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381766/answer","Biography information for Andrea Leadsom","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381766/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381766/answer",,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2015-06-17","Nuclear Power: Regulation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, pursuant to the contribution of the Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change of 17 June 2015, Official Report, columns 108-112WH, what the evidential basis is for the statement that the UK has one of the most robust regulatory regimes in the world for nuclear power.","false","Biography information for Paul Flynn","Newport West","Paul Flynn","3038"

This briefing note states that from a series of peer-reviewed studies, most estimates of nuclear lifecycle emissions internationally are below 26 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Some studies referenced in the note place these values much lower even than 26gCO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh, with cited UK nuclear generation estimated to be between 5.5 and 7gCO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh. These figures are comparable to those for offshore wind generation, stated to be between 5.2 and 13gCO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh.

Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/381936","Ministry of Justice","false","2015-06-26","<p>Discipline Procedures are central to the maintenance of a safe custodial environment. They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on

They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully, fairly and justly, and for prisoners and young people (aged 15-17) to have a full opportunity to hear what is alleged against them and to present their case. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and Young Offender Institutions when necessary to hear adjudication cases which are deemed sufficiently serious. These cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoner’s time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>A range of safeguarding measures are in place to make sure that a prisoner or young person is physically and mentally fit to face an adjudication hearing and any subsequent punishment. Adjudication outcomes are regularly monitored to make sure that no prisoner or young person is charged or punished for any reason other than their disciplinary behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of adjudications by type of adjudicators (Governors or Independent Adjudicators) and on the number of adjudications by a prisoner’s mental health diagnosis is not held centrally.</p><p>

The Department recognises the particular needs of children and young people with autism in education, including supported transition and preparation for adulthood and the reforms emphasise the need for local authorities and other agencies to put support in place early, and to centre it around the child or young person’s own aspirations, interests and needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many aspects of the reforms are of particular benefit to children and young people with autism and their families - in particular, the move to more person-centred, multi-agency and participative Education, Health and Care (EHC) needs assessments and plans. The new legislation provides continuity of support for a young person up to the age of 25, placing a new duty on further education colleges to use their ‘best endeavours’ to support all young people with SEN. The legislation and the Code of Practice have a strong focus on preparing for adulthood, from an early age. Children and young people with autism who do not have statements or EHC plans will benefit in particular from the clearer guidance in the Code on identifying and meeting needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Act also makes provision to ensure that parents, children and young people are able to access impartial information, advice and support. This is available through a local, dedicated and easily identifiable service which includes help to prepare them for meetings with schools, health professionals or other agencies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, under the Department’s Free Schools programme, there are now fourteen open special free schools across the country, including several that are specifically for children with autism, such as the Rise free school in Hounslow, the Lighthouse free school in Leeds and the National Autistic Society’s Church Lawton free school in Cheshire. There are a further thirteen special free schools due to open in the future, including the Heartlands Autism free school in Haringey and a second National Autistic Society free school, the Vanguard free school in Lambeth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department has also contracted with the Autism Education Trust (2015-16) to deliver autism training to education professionals.
