The historic rationale for Mental Health Officer status related to working in long stay mental hospitals that no longer exist. It was clearly inappropriate and unnecessary to retain different pension arrangements for staff working in mental health to other National Health Service staff. This was recognised in 1995 when it was removed for new entrants.</p><p> </p><p>When the normal pension age (NPA) for new members of the scheme changed to 65 in 2008, the only Mental Health Officers with an NPA of 65 are those who, at the time, chose to transfer to the 2008 section of the scheme. Those who did not transfer retained their Mental Health Officer status. As part of the Hutton reforms to public service pensions, scheme members who on 1 April 2012 were not within 10 years of their NPA moved to the 2015 scheme for future service with an NPA the same as their state pension age. Most Mental Health Officers were within 10 years of their NPA of 55 and so were unaffected. A minority of Mental Health Officers did transfer to the 2015 scheme but all their benefits earned up to that point are fully protected and payable in accordance with Mental Health Officer status rules, so without reduction at 55 and including a calculation to reflect the doubling of the value of some service for accrual purposes.</p><p> </p><p>The Working Longer Group, a partnership group of nationally recognised NHS trade unions, NHS employers and health department representatives, was established by the Government to review the implications of the NHS workforce working to a later, raised retirement age.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528624","Department of Health","false","2016-06-30","<p>The introduction of the National Living Wage is part of Government’s wider approach to move from a low wage, high tax, high welfare society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society. The national living wage is an important step in rewarding the valuable contribution made by care workers, who often fall into the lowest earning occupations. It is expected that any increase in costs in the care sector associated with the National Living Wage will be partly met by higher productivity, efficiencies and will also help deliver better-quality care through improvements in staff retention and commitment.</p><p>Local authorities are responsible for ensuring the availability of high quality social care in their areas and the commissioning of local services for those people who are entitled to public funding. They are locally accountable for how their budgets are allocated and spent. The terms and conditions of contracts negotiated between local authorities acting as commissioners of services and providers on an open market are a local matter that should reflect local conditions.</p><p>However, under the Care Act, local authorities must have regard to fostering an effective workforce with the appropriate capabilities when shaping their local markets. The Act and its statutory guidance are absolutely clear that prices and fee rates agreed with providers must reflect these new duties, including the National Living Wage. The Department has also worked with the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, the Local Government Association and care providers to co-produce a set of commissioning standards to support local authorities to assess and improve their commissioning practices. These standards are based on best practice and amplify the requirements set out in statutory guidance.</p><p>As part of the Autumn Spending Review the Government is giving local authorities access to £3.5 billion of new support for social care by 2019/20. Councils will be able to introduce a new Social Care Precept, allowing them to increase council tax by 2% above the existing threshold. This could raise up to £2 billion a year for social care by 2019/20. From April 2017, the Spending Review makes available social care funds for local government, rising to £1.5 billion by 2019/20, to be included in the Better Care Fund. Taken together, the new precept and additional Better Care Fund contribution mean local government has access to the funding it needs to increase social care spending in real terms by the end of the Parliament and meet costs from the introduction of the National Living Wage.</p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2016-06-30T12:45:16.517Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528624/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528624/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528624/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-06-24","Social Services: Living Wage","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, whether he plans to take steps to ensure that the costs of social care do not rise as a result of the introduction of the national living wage.","false","Biography information for Julian Knight","Solihull","Julian Knight","41238"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528009","Department for Education","false","2016-06-29","<p>The High Court oral judgment represents a significant threat to one of the Government’s most important achievements in education over the last six years, improving school attendance.</p><p>There is abundant academic research which shows that time spent in school is one of the single strongest determinants of a pupil’s academic success. The most recent was published by the Department on 24 March, and shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a child’s attainment at the end of key stage 2 and key stage 4. This is unfair on children and potentially damaging to their life chances.</p><p>That is why we have unashamedly pursued a zero tolerance policy on unauthorised absence. We have increased the penalty notices issued to parents for pupils with unauthorised absence, shortened the time it takes to pay a notice from 42 day to 21 days, placed a greater emphasis on school attendance levels in inspection outcomes. We have also tightened the regulations in relation to term time holidays, so that headteachers should only grant such leave in exceptional circumstances. These measures have been very successful.</p><p>The number of persistent absentees in England’s schools has dropped by over 40% from 433,000 in 2009/10 to 246,000 in 2014/15. Some 6 million fewer days were lost due to authorised absences in the first five half terms in 2014/15 compared to the equivalent period in 2012/13 - a drop from a total of 47.9 million days missed to 41.8 million days missed. Overall absence rates have followed a significant downward trend: from 6.5% in the academic year ending in 2007 to 4.6% in the academic year ending in 2015. In 2012/13, 7.0% of all absences were accounted for by authorised term time holiday. This figure dropped to 2.6% of all absences in 2013/14 and 1.6% of all absences in 2014/15.</p><p>This means that pupils are spending many more hours in school being taught the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life. If we are going to address entrenched academic underachievement, continuing to improve school attendance will play a central role in achieving such an ambition.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2016-06-29T08:35:19.11Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528009/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528009/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528009/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-06-20","Pupils: Absenteeism","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, pursuant to the Oral Statement of the Minister of State for Schools of 19 May 2016, on term-time holidays, what progress the Government has made on improving levels of school attendance.","false","Biography information for Mr William Wragg","Hazel Grove","William Wragg","40958"

There is a very clear framework in place for all professionals who work with children to report concerns. The statutory guidance <em>Working Together to Safeguard Children (2015)</em> emphasises that safeguarding is the responsibility of all professionals who work with children.</p><p>The Department does receive correspondence and information from professionals and members of the public, alerting staff that they believe a child may be at risk of harm. Procedures are in place to ensure that in such circumstances if the Department’s staff and its Agencies, including the Education Funding Agency (EFA), believe a child is at immediate risk of harm, steps are taken to notify the Director of Children’s Services in the relevant local authority within 24 hours. Local Authorities have duties under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. It is for the local authority to undertake any assessment and provide services to keep children safe.</p><p>In response to the failures we saw in Rotherham and elsewhere, the Government issued a revised version of the statutory guidance, ‘Working Together to Safeguard Children’ in 2015, setting out an unambiguous statement of accountability about the overarching responsibilities of local authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children in their area. It also made clear the vital role of other professionals including police, schools, social workers and health in keeping children safe. ‘Working Together’ provides a clear framework for monitoring the effectiveness of local services and how they work together in fulfilling their duties.</p><p>In discharging our role on safeguarding, the Department and EFA may also involve Ofsted.

To ensure effective delivery we have worked with Ofsted, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation and the Care Quality Commission to deliver a new system of joint targeted area inspections to better assess how local agencies are working in a co-ordinated manner to identify and respond to children at risk of abuse and neglect.

Spending on mental health is expected to increase to £11.7 billion for 2014/15 and CCGs are committed to increasing their spending on mental health each year at least in line with the growth of their overall funding allocation.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England has asked local National Health Service areas to develop and implement sustainability and transformation plans this year to demonstrate how local services will be built around the needs of local people. This includes measures to improve primary care and developing better models of out of hospital care.</p><p> </p><p>We established the Better Care Fund which is enabling local authorities to access around £3.5 billion a year to improve services and achieve better integration of health and social care commissioning. The Better Care Fund is one of the most ambitious programmes across the NHS and local government to date. It creates a local single pooled budget to incentivise the NHS and local government to work more closely together around people, placing their wellbeing as the focus of health and care services, and shifting resources into social care and community services for the benefit of the people, communities and health and care systems.</p><p> </p><p>The independent Mental Health Taskforce published earlier this year made a recommendation for NHS England to that people being supported in specialist older-age acute physical health services have access to liaison mental health teams – including expertise in the psychiatry of older adults. We have accepted these recommendations.</p><p> </p><p>We set out plans for transforming primary care in 2014 which includes supporting people with the most complex needs by general practitioners developing a proactive and personalised programme of care and support tailored to their needs and views. This is being led by the Proactive Care Programme which is designed to bring about a step change in the quality of care for frail older people (including those with mental health problems) and other patients with complex needs. It enables CCGs to shift funding into primary care services and community health services to address issues such as avoidable admissions to hospitals and gaps in service provision.</p><p> </p><p>In February 2015, the Prime Minister launched his new Challenge on Dementia 2020 to make sure that dementia care, support, awareness and research are transformed by 2020. The Challenge Implementation Plan, published in March 2016, set out the actions partners across health and care will take to ensure commitments in the 2020 Challenge are delivered. These include:</p><p> </p><p>- every person diagnosed with dementia having meaningful care following their diagnosis, which supports them and those around them;</p><p>- information made available locally on post-diagnosis services and how these can be accessed;</p><p>- access to relevant advice and support to help and advice on what happens after a diagnosis and the support available through the journey; and</p><p>- carers of people with dementia being made aware of and offered the opportunity for respite, education, training, emotional and psychological support so that they feel able to cope with their caring responsibilities and to have a life alongside caring.</p><p> </p><p>Alongside the Implementation Plan the Department has published, together with key dementia stakeholders, a “Joint Declaration on Post-Diagnostic Dementia Care and Support”. This sets out the key principles of good quality post-diagnostic care for people with dementia.</p><p> </p><p>The Department has prioritised prevention and through the Care Act 2014 it has required local authorities to have measures in place to identify people in their area who would benefit from universal services to help reduce, delay or prevent needs for care and support. This includes needs that may arise from social isolation.</p><p> </p><p>Local authorities must consider if an adult is socially isolated or lonely when assessing them for adult social care. The Eligibility Regulations require local authorities to take into account whether a person wants to develop and maintain family or other personal relationships when assessing their eligibility for social care.</p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2016-06-29T10:03:46.287Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528083/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528083/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/528083/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-06-20","Mental Health Services: Older People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what resources his Department has allocated to support for older people with mental health issues in (a) England and (b) East Sussex in 2016-17.","false","Biography information for Ms Nusrat Ghani","Wealden","Nusrat Ghani","41062"
