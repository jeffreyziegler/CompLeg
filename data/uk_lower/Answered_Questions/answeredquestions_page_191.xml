Implementation of Each Home Counts is being led by industry with the support of Government, in line with the recommendations of the review. One of the main recommendations from the Review was to establish a quality mark for retrofit energy efficiency and renewable energy measures to help offer a clear and consistent standard for consumers. Those businesses who wish to use the quality mark will need to adhere to a customer charter and code of conduct which will ensure appropriate levels of consumer protection including around mis-selling.</p><p> </p><p>The Department has specific responsibilities for certain schemes and I set out below steps taken to protect consumers in key areas.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Green Deal: </strong>The Green Deal helps consumers make energy-saving improvements to their properties with the cost repaid via the consumer’s electricity bill. There is an established process for handling complaints. In the first instance, consumers should approach their Green Deal Provider. Where the Green Deal Provider is unable to resolve the complaint satisfactorily, the consumer may approach the Green Deal Ombudsman or for complaints relating to the mis-selling of credit, the Financial Ombudsman Service. The consumer redress process is set out in The Green Deal Framework (Disclosure, Acknowledgment, Redress etc.) Regulations, and is supplemented by the Green Deal Code of Practice. Under certain circumstances, where a consumer is not satisfied with the decision of the relevant Ombudsman, the regulations also allow for cases to be referred to the Secretary of State, who may impose reduction or cancellation of Green Deal plans.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Renewable Heat Incentive and Feed-in Tariff: </strong>The Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme provides financial incentives to install renewable heating systems to support the transition to low-carbon heating in the UK. The Feed-in Tariff scheme is a programme designed to promote the uptake of small-scale renewable and low-carbon electricity generation technologies. It is a key condition of both schemes that the renewable energy technology product and the installer are certified to the standards of the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS), a third party certification scheme. This ensures that people who buy renewable energy systems and apply to these schemes are covered by consumer protection schemes governing the quality and performance of the products, as well as the quality of the installation and service they receive from the installer.</p><p> </p><p>Installers are required to be a member of a Consumer Code, backed by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, which covers advertising and promotion, behaviour of sales staff, proposals, estimates and quotes, terms of business, cancellation rights, deposits and prepayments, guarantees, maintenance and service agreements and service and repair.</p><p> </p><p>Complaints about the installed product, the installation, or the installer can be submitted to the MCS. A Complaint Guidelines document is published on the Scheme’s website. Depending on the nature of the complaint, it is then dealt with by the MCS Administrator, the relevant Certification Body which certificated the product or the installer, or the Consumer Code of which the installer is a member.</p><p> </p><p>Consumers not covered by the protections above should contact their local Trading Standards.</p>","Devizes","Claire Perry",,"2018-01-11T10:59:28.057Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810491/answer","Biography information for Claire Perry","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810491/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810491/answer",,,,,"201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2017-12-21","Green Deal Scheme: Misrepresentation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, what his Department's policy is on tackling incidences of mis-selling of green energy deals.","false","Biography information for Dr Lisa Cameron","East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow","Dr Lisa Cameron","120837"

The GD ORB also monitors compliance against the Green Deal Code of Practice and use of the Green Deal Quality Mark. These processes seek to ensure that Green Deal Providers operate to a high standard for the benefit of all scheme stakeholders, and that consumers entering Green Deal plans are appropriately protected. Where things go wrong, the Green Deal Ombudsman is available to consumers to seek redress and the Regulations provide remedies for consumer redress.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/810677","Department for Transport","false","2018-01-15","<p>It should be noted that it is not possible to make year-on-year comparisons over these four years due to significant changes in the way that the data requested is recorded, in particular due to a change in travel provider towards the end of 2015/16. The change in travel provider has also made it difficult to obtain a full set of data for 2015/16 and prior years without incurring disproportionate cost.</p><p> </p><p>All central Department staff, who incur most of the travel spend across the DfT family, are expected to travel standard class irrespective of grade except under very limited circumstances. With respect to air travel staff are allowed to book non-standard class flights if they are longer than eight hours in duration and with the expectation that the individual needs to carry out Departmental work as soon as they arrive at the destination. The majority of the central Department non-standard class air travel is incurred by aviation security officials flying to long-haul destinations around the world for sensitive aviation security operations.</p><p> </p><p>Aside from the central Department, the vast majority otherwise of the business class air travel is incurred by the VCA and the MCA. However, for VCA the majority of overseas travel is chargeable to the VCA's clients and so any business class air travel spend by the VCA will result in only a minimal net cost to the taxpayer.</p><p> </p><p>Similarly, MCA’s Marine Surveyors are required to survey UK-registered ships on a regular basis wherever the ship may be at that time and they have to fly globally to those locations. The cost of the airfare is recovered as part of the fee paid by the shipping company for the regulatory work, so therefore any business class air travel by the MCA will result in only a minimal net cost to the taxpayer.</p><p> </p><p>With respect to first class rail travel, all central Department staff must travel standard class irrespective of grade, except under two specific circumstances - temporary or permanent disability and pregnancy related reasons.</p><p> </p><p>Over the four years in question, data is not available from either all parts of the Department or for all time periods. In addition, for the central Department for the years 2013/14 to 2015/16, due to the way that travel was booked at this time, it is not possible to obtain a complete record of spend. Therefore it is not possible to compare the spend data from year to year.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For 2013/14, available information covering the central Department, DVLA, VCA, DSA, the MCA and Highways Agency is: Taxi spend = £169,052 (though no information is available for the MCA); first class rail travel = £33,873 and business class air travel = £243,170. No information is available for VOSA.</p><p> </p><p>For 2014/15, data is only available covering the first 8 months of the year except the central Department does have taxi spend data for 12 months. Data covering the central Department, DVLA, VCA, DSA, the MCA and the Highways Agency is: Taxi spend = £153,246 (though no information is available for the MCA); first class rail travel = £18,477 and business class air travel = £110,188. No information is available for VOSA.</p><p> </p><p>For 2015/16, data is mainly only available covering the last 4 months of the year due to a change in travel provider, except the DVLA does have 12 months of data for all spend and the central Department, VCA and MCA do have taxi spend data for 12 months. Data covering the central Department, DVLA and VCA is: Taxi spend = £182,099 (this also includes MCA spend); first class rail travel = £5,479 (no data available for the MCA); business class air travel = £167,420 (no data available for the MCA). No information is available for the DVSA and the Highways Agency is no longer an Executive Agency of DfT.</p><p> </p><p>For 2016/17, data is available for the full 12 months of the year for the central Department, DVLA, VCA and MCA: Taxi spend = £191,307; first class rail travel = £10,503; business class air travel = £1,155,965.
