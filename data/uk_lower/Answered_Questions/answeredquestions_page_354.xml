This report, which includes data from 1 February 2014 to 30 April 2015, assesses the quality of care by specialist rheumatology services using criteria derived from sources, including the rheumatoid arthritis quality standard, published by the NICE in June 2013. The report identifies that although most services offer prompt educational support and agree targets for treatment with their patients, performance against criteria for referral and assessment could be improved. Since the audit, HQIP has reported that a number of trusts have successfully reconfigured their services in order to improve patient care.</p><p> </p><p>More information can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.hqip.org.uk/national-programmes/a-z-of-nca/arthritis-rheumatoid-and-early-inflammatory" target="_blank">www.hqip.org.uk/national-programmes/a-z-of-nca/arthritis-rheumatoid-and-early-inflammatory</a></p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2016-03-11T12:33:05.917Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/457550/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/457550/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/457550/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-03-03","Arthritis","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, with reference to the NICE quality standards on rheumatoid arthritis, what steps he has taken to ensure patients with early inflammatory arthritis are referred from their GP to rheumatology services within three days.","false","Biography information for Mr Geoffrey Cox","Torridge and West Devon","Mr Geoffrey Cox","29657"
