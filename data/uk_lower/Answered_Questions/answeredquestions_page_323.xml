Broadly speaking somebody is statutorily homeless if they do not have accommodation that they have a legal right to occupy, which is accessible and physically available to them (and their household) and which it would be reasonable for them to continue to live in. It would not be reasonable for someone to continue to live in their home, for example, if that was likely to lead to violence against them (or a member of their family).</p><p>We have protected homelessness prevention funding for local authorities, totalling £315 million by 2020.

Since 2010, this funding has allowed local authorities to prevent more than a million households from becoming homeless. We are determined to ensure that we prevent more people from becoming homeless in the first place so we are working with local authorities, homelessness charities and across departments to consider options to prevent more people from becoming homeless.</p><p>We have also increased central funding to tackle homelessness to £139 million over the next four years, which will include targeted funding for rough sleeping.

To implement the Government’s commitment to transform GP access however, £175 million has been invested in the Prime Minister’s GP Access Fund to test improved and innovative access to GP services. Across the two waves of the Access Fund, there are 57 schemes covering over 2,500 practices and 18 million patients – a third of the population – have benefited from improved access and transformational change at local level. This includes more appointments being made available, especially at times more convenient for patients, such as weekday evenings and weekends. It also includes different approaches like telephone consultations and better use of the wider primary care workforce (such as Advanced Nurse Practitioners, pharmacists, the voluntary sector, physiotherapists and paramedics) to deliver improved access to patients. These approaches have helped release local GP capacity and more appropriately matched the needs of patients with the most appropriate professional to care for them. In addition to Access Fund sites, other clinical commissioning groups may offer local initiatives for improving access to GPs.</p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2016-07-13T16:58:41.087Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/533871/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/533871/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/533871/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-07-08","General Practitioners","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what progress has been made in reducing GP waiting times.","false","Biography information for Danny Kinahan","South Antrim","Danny Kinahan","42256"

All schools are required by law to have a behaviour policy with measures to prevent all forms of bullying. Ofsted holds schools to account for how well they safeguard children and prevent bullying. As well as looking at schools records of bullying inspectors take into account:</p><p> </p><p>o the views of pupils about the prevention of bullying, including online bullying and how the school deals with discrimination.</p><p>o the views expressed formally and informally by different groups of pupils, of their experiences of others’ behaviour and attitudes towards them and their understanding of the importance of such attributes in school and adult life.</p><p> </p><p>Sex and relationships education (SRE) is compulsory in all maintained secondary schools and academies are expected to provide SRE as part of a broad and balanced curriculum.</p><p> </p><p>Any school teaching SRE must have regard to Secretary of State’s Sex and Relationship Education Guidance (2000). The guidance makes clear that all sex and relationship education should be age-appropriate and that schools should ensure young people develop positive values and a moral framework that will guide their decisions, judgments and behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>To support teaching about healthy relationships, the PSHE Association has developed non-statutory guidance for schools about the topic of consent, which was published in March 2015 and can be found at <a href="http://www.pshe-association.org.uk" target="_blank">www.pshe-association.org.uk</a>. We strongly welcome this guidance. The PSHE Association’s guidance will help teachers clearly establish the legal framework around consent and supports the government’s ‘This is Abuse’ campaign, which helps educate young people about damaging behaviours within relationships. ‘This is abuse’ was followed up this year by the £3.85 million “Disrespect NoBody” campaign, supported by Government Equalities Office and Home Office. The campaign aims to prevent the onset of domestic violence in adults by challenging attitudes and behaviours amongst teenage boys and girls that abuse in relationships is acceptable.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson","42007","2016-07-13T13:53:34.317Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/533360/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/533360/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/533360/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-07-06","Schools: Sexual Harassment","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps her Department is taking to prevent sexual harassment in schools.","false","Biography information for Andrew Stephenson","Pendle","Andrew Stephenson","42005"

Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some BNF sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community.

In 10 of our most challenging prisons we have already started a recruitment programme. I am pleased to say that we have already made 280 job offers for those 400 jobs, on top of 1,400 new officers appointed in the last 12 months.</p><p>The information requested is shown in the tables below. Since the summer of 2014, NOMS have effectively managed operational stability through arrangements that redeploy staff to neighbouring establishments. Payment Plus is one of the measures available to NOMS that has been used alongside national Detached Duty arrangements.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="12"><p><strong>Table 1: Amount paid in Payment
