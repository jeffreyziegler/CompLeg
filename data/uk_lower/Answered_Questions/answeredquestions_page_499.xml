"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/58386","Department of Health","false","2014-06-12","<p>The Government is committed to supporting the availability of suitable accommodation for those who are being discharged from hospital. It has already taken steps to demonstrate this commitment and is in the process of establishing new opportunities and mechanisms by which this can be done. Examples of these include:</p><p> </p><p>- The recently passed Care Act consolidates duties on local authorities in relation to wellbeing, which specifically include consideration of “suitable living accommodation” as a component of that duty.</p><p> </p><p>- Housing has also been classified as a “health related service” so that housing and suitability of accommodation should be considered in any assessment (including on discharge from hospital).</p><p> </p><p>- The Better Care Fund (BCF), which this Government has established with £3.8 billion funding provides a vehicle to enhance and increase the pace of effective integration between health and social care. Clearly where suitable housing is identified as a barrier to the achievement of key measures within the BCF localities can choose to use funding within the BCF to address this. The opportunity to do this is the inclusion within the BCF of the Disabled Facilities Grant with £220 million being made available within 2015-16.</p><p> </p><p>- The Disabled Facilities Grant is for the provision of adaptations to the homes of disabled people to help them to live independently. Disabled Facilities Grant adaptations include things like stair-lifts, level access showers, winches and ramps. Many people apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant upon exit from hospital because their home is no longer suitable to meet their needs.</p><p> </p><p>- In terms of the Disabled Facilities Grant and the period of the last Spending Review, £785 million was made available by the Department for Communities and Local Government. They funded an organisation called Foundations, which is the national body for Home Improvement Agencies (HIAs) which help older, disabled and vulnerable people to live independently in their own homes for longer. HIAs deliver around 50% of all Disabled Facilities Grants in England.</p><p> </p><p>- HIAs also provide additional services for older and vulnerable people such as handyperson services, to carry out small jobs around the home also known as minor adaptations, which are things like grab rails, ramps and moving furniture eg; moving a bed downstairs. Many HIAs provide a bespoke service called “home from hospital” or “hospital discharge” services which adapt people's homes allowing them to be discharged from hospital more quickly and freeing up hospital beds. £50 million was also made available for handyperson services during the period 2011 to 2015.</p><p> </p><p>- Under the homelessness legislation a household will be considered homeless if a local housing authority determines that it would no longer be reasonable for them to continue to occupy their accommodation. This can clearly apply to an individual's change in circumstances following a stay in hospital. If a local housing authority has reason to believe that an applicant may be homeless or threatened with homelessness then they must make enquiries in order to establish if they are owed a duty.</p><p> </p><p>- If a person is homeless through no fault of their own, eligible for assistance and in priority need then the local housing authority will have a duty to secure suitable accommodation for the household's occupation. Priority need is defined in legislation to include applicants with children and households that include someone who is vulnerable, for example because of old age, or physical or mental disability, have a priority need for accommodation.</p><p> </p><p>- The Department of Health has supported the resource &quot;Hospital to Home&quot; pathway which we know many areas consider in terms of supporting an individual's recovery and preventing readmission. The resource contains information, suggestions for action, case studies and checklists for considering older patients' housing situations in hospital discharge and transfer of care.</p><p> </p><p>- The Shared Commitment for integrated care and support, published in May 2013 and which the Department of Health, the NHS, local government and the voluntary sector were involved in signing up to specifically highlighted the importance of suitable housing being available as part of safe and effective discharge from hospitals.</p><p> </p>","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb",,"2014-06-12T16:06:33.4150598Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/58386/answer","Biography information for Norman Lamb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/58386/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/58386/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-06-05","Hospital Beds","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps his Department takes to ensure that people do not face delayed discharge from hospital because there is no suitable housing for them to be discharged; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Mr Mark Williams","Ceredigion","Mr Mark Williams","199264"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/58398","Department of Health","false","2014-06-12","<p>Mental health has been a priority for this Government for several years now. We made this commitment explicit in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 which, for the first time, creates equal status for mental and physical health across Government and for the NHS and social care.</p><p> </p><p>The Ministerial Advisory Group brings together individuals and organisations with a specific interest in the cross government mental health strategy <em>No Health Without Mental Health</em> and how it is delivered.</p><p> </p><p>The Mandate to NHS England 2014-15 makes clear that 'everyone who needs it should have timely access to evidence-based services', this will involve extending and ensuring more open access to programmes, in particular for children and young people, and for those out of work.</p><p> </p><p><em>Closing the Gap</em>, our new mental health action plan, which has attracted widespread, cross-sector support, sets out our priorities for essential change in mental health, 25 areas where people can expect to see and experience the fastest changes. The document challenges the health and social care community to move further and faster to transform care and support; the public health community, alongside local government, to give health and wellbeing promotion and prevention the long-overdue attention it needs and deserves; and individuals and communities to shift attitudes in mental health.</p><p> </p><p>The Department of Health is leading an information revolution around mental health. The new national Mental Health Intelligence Network will draw together comprehensive information about mental health and wellbeing.</p><p> </p><p>The new Crisis Care Concordat, signed by more than 20 national organisations, is a commitment for all agencies involved in supporting someone in a crisis to work together to improve the system of care and support so people in crisis are kept safe and helped to find the support they need. All the signatories have pledged to work together and our expectation is that, in every locality in England, local partnerships of health, criminal justice and local authority agencies will agree and commit to local Mental Health Crisis Declarations.</p><p> </p><p>System partners are also taking responsibility for the drive for parity. Public Health England (PHE) has made a commitment to addressing parity of esteem through prioritising mental health and working to embed it throughout all PHE programmes. Greater attention is needed to mental health throughout the public health system and PHE seeks to enable and support this through its leadership and delivery of a Wellbeing and Mental Health programme. It is supporting local authorities and other partners to give greater attention to mental health within the public health system.</p><p> </p><p>PHE was established on 1 April 2013 with the mission to protect and improve the nation's health and to address inequalities through working with national and local government, the NHS, industry and the voluntary and community sector.

Greater attention is needed to mental health throughout the public health system and PHE seeks to enable and support this through its leadership and delivery of a Wellbeing and Mental Health programme. It is supporting local authorities and other partners to give greater attention to mental health within the public health system.</p><p> </p><p>Their approach centres on the following five main objectives:</p><p> </p><p>1. Promoting good mental health and improving population wellbeing;</p><p>2. Preventing mental health problems and preventing suicide and self-harm;</p><p>3. Supporting people living with and recovering from mental illness;</p><p>4. Tackling inequalities and improving the wider determinants of wellbeing and mental health; and</p><p>5. Enabling and embedding wellbeing and mental health across the public health system.</p><p> </p><p>PHE has embraced the principles of Parity of Esteem and from the outset and all through transition, there has been a commitment by PHE to ensure mental health is a core part of the new public health system and PHE's work. Even though there was no central national resource attached to mental health to be transferred into PHE, they have invested in establishing a presence for mental health across their work and they continue to embed population mental health and wellbeing across public health.</p><p> </p><p>Health Education England is developing training programmes that will enable all healthcare employers to ensure that their staff have a greater awareness of mental health problems and how they may affect their patients.

Details of this study, including evidence of expense, disruption and capacity, can be found at:</p><p><a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/alternativestudy/pdf/railintervention.pdf" target="_blank">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/alternativestudy/pdf/railintervention.pdf</a>.</p><p>This work found that while double deck carriages could increase the number of passengers per train there is a practical limit to the expansion of capacity in this manner and it offers limited potential to lead to journey time savings.</p><p> </p><p>This option is also likely to lead to significant disruption and expense. Before such trains could be used on the West Coast Mainline, the route (including diversionary routes) would need to be gauge cleared to allow sufficient space for the trains to operate. This would involve raising all overhead wires, raising bridges, modifying platforms on the route, modifying station canopies, moving or raising all signal gantries and other signage on the route, and lowering track in the tunnels. Work would need to be carried out to modify existing depots or to provide new ones. Additional works would also be required to enable line speeds to be maintained on the route.</p><p> </p><p>For these reasons it was concluded that there was a strong case for not considering this option further.

That's why we are doubling the amount of education we give those in Young Offenders Institutions and why we are reforming the youth estate with the introduction of Secure Colleges. These new establishments will tackle the root cause of offending by giving people the skills and self-discipline to gain employment and training upon release and turn their lives around. We announced on 8 June the name of the company selected to design and build the pathfinder.</p><p> </p><p>Table 1 (attached) shows the number of young offenders by their previous criminal history for young offenders cautioned or sentenced (a) by Suffolk Police Force Area; and (b) across England and Wales. There is no national definition of a persistent offender, with Local Criminal Justice Boards setting criteria locally to identify persistent offenders based on their volume of crime and impact on their local community. The table below therefore shows offenders with one or more previous cautions or sentencing occasions. The Police National Computer (PNC) does not break down information below police force area; it is not therefore possible to provide data specific only to Bury St Edmunds. Due to variations in local definitions of “persistent”, it is not possible to determine the proportion of overall offences committed by “persistent” offenders in any of the geographical areas specified.</p><p> </p><p>These figures are based on counting the number of separate occasions on which offenders were cautioned or sentenced in each year and some offenders will therefore be represented several times in the figures. They are based only on those offences recorded on the PNC by an English or Welsh police force, including the British Transport Police. The figures therefore exclude a range of low-level (non-recordable) summary offences committed by these offenders e.g. TV licence evasion and speeding as these are not recorded on the PNC. As with any large scale recording system the PNC is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p><p> </p>","Kenilworth and Southam","Jeremy Wright",,"2014-06-11T16:51:30.8598031Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/57706/answer","Biography information for Jeremy Wright","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/57706/answer","Table 1 - Juvenile Offenders 2009-2013.doc","Table 1 - Juvenile Offenders 2009-2013.doc","Table 1 - Juvenile Offenders 2009-2013","Table 1 - Juvenile Offenders 2009-2013","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/57706/answer",,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-06-04","Young Offenders","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many persistent young offenders were registered in (a) Bury St Edmunds, (b) Suffolk and (c) England and Wales in each of the last five years; and how many and what proportion of total offences were attributable to such offenders in that period.","false","Biography information for Mr David Ruffley","Bury St Edmunds","Mr David Ruffley","198564"
