Research spending on dementia has increased by nearly 50% since 2010/11, and is on course to meet the Government's target of doubling public sector research funding on dementia to £66 million by 2015. During the second year of the Prime Minister's Challenge, research funders have implemented and enhanced initiatives to generate the research evidence needed to make a step change in prevention, treatment and care. Research on non-drug therapies represents a significant part of this effort.</p><p> </p><p>In December 2012, £22 million of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funding was announced for 21 successful research projects that will pioneer dementia diagnosis and ground breaking treatments. Subsequently the Government allocated £20 million for research on living well with dementia (projects commencing in early 2014) with the NIHR and the Economic and Social Research Council awarding funding research grants focused on improving quality of life for people with dementia and their carers. This research programme represents the world's largest social science research programme on dementia and care, comprising six major research studies to support living well with dementia initiatives and identifying effective interventions, in the clinic, in the nursing home, and in everyday life.</p><p> </p><p>The NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research Programme is now also calling for further applications for research funding on dementia services, to address key priorities identified following a James Lind Alliance and Alzheimer's Society priority setting partnership between patients, carers, researchers and clinicians (held in 2013). This was broad and included all aspects of patient experience and care.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, one of the NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) and Units (BRUs) with dementia-related research themes, the NIHR Oxford BRC has a theme focussing on cognitive health. For this, the BRC has brought together an alliance of multi-disciplinary researchers to produce an integrated programme of translational research in cognitive health, aiming to produce benefit for patients by harnessing the lifelong adaptive ability of the brain to protect against the onset of dementia and to limit the impact of dementia on people's lives.</p><p> </p><p>Within the award of 13 new NIHR Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care there is also considerable focus on research into non-drug approaches to dementia care.</p><p> </p>","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb",,"2014-06-26T14:26:29.5511742Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/62919/answer","Biography information for Norman Lamb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/62919/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/62919/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-06-19","Dementia","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he has taken to encourage and support research into non-drug dementia therapies; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Tracey Crouch","Chatham and Aylesford","Tracey Crouch","201477"

The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (sections 68 – 70) defines social housing as low cost rental accommodation and low cost home ownership accommodation. In the Act, a low cost rent is simply defined as below the market rate. Low cost home ownership is defined by its availability for occupation on a shared ownership or equity percentage basis. This provides flexibility to support a range of people with different housing needs through our affordable housing programmes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For planning purposes, the definition set out in the National Planning Policy Framework is as follows:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“ Social rented, affordable rented and intermediate housing, provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market.

Affordable housing should include provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Social rented housing is owned by local authorities and private registered providers (as defined in section 80 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008), for which guideline target rents are determined through the national rent regime.

We continue to do all we can to prevent people from using drugs in the first place and intervene early with those who start to develop problems. For example, we are taking action to break intergenerational paths to drug misuse by supporting the UK's most troubled families and supporting practitioners working with young people through the production of an on-line Alcohol and Drug Education and Prevention Information Service.<br><br>We are confident that our strategic approach is producing good results. Drug use has fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1996, and people going into treatment today are more likely to free themselves from dependency than ever before. <br><br>The Alcohol Strategy proposed a range of measures to radically reshape the approach to alcohol and reduce excessive drinking and tackle the crime and health harms associated with it. We have provided more powers for local areas to restrict opening and closing times, control the density of licensed premises, and charge a late night levy to support policing. In May we introduced a ban on the worst cases of very cheap and harmful alcohol sales and are taking forward a wide range of action to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder. This includes working with 20 Local Alcohol Action Areas to cut alcohol-related crime and disorder, and reduce the damage caused to people's health. Underpinning this work is the goal of promoting diverse and vibrant night-time economies that do not centre on drinking alcohol.<br><br>Through the Responsibility Deal, the alcohol industry has adopted a core commitment to ‘foster a culture of responsible drinking which will help people to drink within guidelines'. This includes a pledge to give consumers a wider choice of lower strength products and take one billion units out of the market by 2015. From April 2013, the NHS Healthcheck included an alcohol risk assessment for adults aged 40-75 year olds, with an assessment every five years.
