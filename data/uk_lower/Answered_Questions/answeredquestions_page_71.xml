More than 45,000 foreign national offenders have been removed from the UK since 2010, and in the last financial year almost 6,000 were removed from prisons, immigration removal centres, and the community.</p><p> </p><p>The Early Removal Scheme is the principal method for removing foreign national offenders early from prison. In 2017/18, over 2,000 foreign national offenders were removed under this scheme. Prisoners may also be transferred to a prison in their own country under Prisoner Transfer Agreements. The principal compulsory prisoner transfer scheme is the EU Prisoner Transfer Framework Decision (2008/909/JHA). In addition, compulsory transfer may take place under the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, and a small number of bilateral prisoner transfer agreements.</p><p> </p><p>Our departure from the European Union will have implications on prisoner transfers to the EU. If we leave the EU without a ‘deal’, we will lose access to the EU Prisoner Transfer Framework Decision. This will mean falling back on the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and its Additional Protocol, which we believe to be a less effective mechanism than the EU agreement. Therefore, under a ‘no deal’ scenario we should be prepared to see a decline in the number of transfers to and from the EU.</p><p> </p><p>The tables below provide information for England and Wales, taken from Management Information. In relation to British national prisoners transferred into England and Wales, Management Information does not distinguish between prisoners transferred under the EU Prisoner Transfer Framework Decision and the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. Transfer may therefore have taken place on either a voluntary or compulsory basis. Please note that transfers have not taken place to several countries listed in the tables below as the UK either does not hold nationals from those countries in our prisons, or because there are concerns that prisons might be in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In England, these permits are issued by the Environment Agency (EA) and control the levels of pollution in effluent discharges by setting limits on the chemical concentration and volume of the effluent. The limits are set to protect waters from the adverse impacts of pollution and to meet the appropriate environmental standards for river, ground water and bathing water quality. Operators must comply with the permit and it is an offence to breach a permit condition. Enforcement action may be taken dependant on the nature and severity of the offence.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to controlling pollution from discharges using permits, the EA receives around 40,000 water pollution incident reports per year. Most have little or minor impact but there are around 250 incidents per year which are classified as significant or serious. Very few of these are deliberate acts and are caused accidentally after spillage or system failure. Most significant or serious pollution incidents come from the water industry and agriculture. The remainder are spread across other sectors such as transport, retail, manufacturing, domestic and residential or are a result of natural causes.</p><p> </p><p>The EA responds to all serious incidents and follows them up with appropriate action including warning letters, formal caution, civil sanctions and prosecution. In 2014 the sentencing guidelines were revised so that fines are now related to the level of culpability and the company’s turnover. This has seen a steep rise in the value of fines which is now a much greater deterrent to causing pollution.</p><p> </p><p>Working to control discharges through environmental permits and by taking decisive action in response to pollution offences has led to significant reductions in pollution and improvements in water quality over recent years. Plans for continued improvement in this area are included in the Government's 25 Year Environmental Plan.</p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey",,"2019-02-18T11:06:26.307Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1058690/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1058690/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1058690/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-02-11","Water: Pollution Control","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his Department is taking to reduce water pollution from industry.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","219438"

This is, in our view, critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the most vulnerable countries. DFID’s crises response is needs-based, and therefore particularly sensitive to women and girls, as one of the groups most impacted in crises. DFID also continuously adapts its programmes to prepare for, and build resilience to, crises. This includes a focus on supporting jobs and livelihoods for the most vulnerable groups including women and girls. In Nepal, we support disaster risk reduction efforts that provide work opportunities to the most vulnerable and ensure that women can access these through targeted recruitment campaigns.

Sharing knowledge openly has benefits not only for researchers, but also businesses and wider society by accelerating new discoveries.</p><p>The UK is among the world’s top research nations, with a world-leading research and innovation base for attracting and retaining researchers. As set out in the UKRI Strategic Prospectus, “talent” and “open research” are two key foundations for excellent research and innovation. Throughout the Open Access Review UKRI will be engaging and consulting with the sector and a range of relevant stakeholders, including researchers, to understand the effects of its Open Access policy. Transitioning towards Open Access is the direction of travel taken by all leading research nations, and UKRI will be taking an evidence-based approach, and will consider the international context in its Review to help ensure that the UK remains a top destination for global researchers.</p><p>The UK’s substantial commitment to Open Access over the past years has resulted in it being at the forefront of the global movement to Open Access. This has benefited the UK, for example through increased levels of international collaboration as set out in the “Ascent of Open Access” report from Digital Science (available at <a href="https://www.digital-science.com/blog/news/the-ascent-of-open-access-report/" target="_blank">https://www.digital-science.com/blog/news/the-ascent-of-open-access-report/</a>).

Loop systems are installed in the Chamber and all Committee rooms, with infrared systems additionally available within Committee rooms 1 to 4, 2A, 3A and the Moses Room. Handheld radio transmitters are also available to hearing-aid users when in the Chamber, to reduce interference from electrical equipment and improve the quality of sound provided by the audio loop.</p><p> </p><p>We are currently exploring options to provide an audio description service for Chamber and Committee proceedings. This will provide blind and partially sighted members, committee witnesses and members of the public with a voiced description of which member or witness is currently speaking, transmitted directly via an audio service. A feasibility study was commissioned in January 2019 and will report back later this year.</p><p> </p><p>Further microphones are due to be added to the Chamber this year, which will improve the quality of service provided to hearing aid users. A greater number of microphones situated closer to the people speaking minimises background noise and gives a cleaner sound on the audio which is sent directly to hearing aids via the loop system. The large number of microphones used in Committee meetings, whether automated or operated by an engineer, help to keep the sound clear and maximise the quality of sound experienced by hearing aid users.</p><p> </p><p>For those with hearing impairments which do not require the use of a hearing aid, overall audibility in Committee Rooms 2A, 3A and 4A is generally good.
