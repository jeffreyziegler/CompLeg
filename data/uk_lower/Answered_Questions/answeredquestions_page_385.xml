To support that continued growth and build capacity in the sector, the government has made capital funding available to create nursery provision as part of new Free Schools which will create at least 4,000 places. This government has supported existing providers to expand by reducing bureaucracy and making it easier for providers such as childminders and schools, to provide places and will continue to do so. In addition, we are trialling innovative ways of providing the extended entitlement next year, in particular to look at how the childcare can be provided more flexibly to suit the needs of working parents and increase choice. So far, there have been over one thousand expressions of interest to take part in the early implementation of the extended entitlement.</p><p>There is an extensive menu of childcare support in addition to the Department for Education offer including: the Universal Credit Childcare element; Tax-Free Childcare; and help with childcare costs under the Jobcentre Plus Flexible Support Fund to enable parents to undertake training, attend interviews or start work.

October public sector finance figures show government borrowing is falling, down £6.6 billion so far this year compared to last year. However, the job is not yet done. The government is committed to eliminating the deficit and returning the public finances to a more sustainable path. To achieve this, the Spending Review and Autumn Statement 2015 sets out the action required to return the country to surplus over the course of this Parliament. <br /> On the basis of these plans, the latest OBR forecast estimates that borrowing in 2015-16 will be on a like-for-like basis £73.5bn, £0.6bn lower relative to Summer Budget. The forecast also shows the government is on track to meet its fiscal targets, with a budget surplus of £10.1bn by 2019-20 and debt falling as a percentage of GDP in 2015-16 and for each year in this Parliament.",,"Lord O'Neill of Gatley",,"2015-12-04T14:47:45.707Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431436/answer","Biography information for Lord O'Neill of Gatley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431436/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/431436/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2015-11-20","Public Sector: Borrowing","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of the net level of borrowing by the public sector in October 2015.","false","Biography information for Lord Kennedy of Southwark",,"Lord Kennedy of Southwark","HL3787"

When pernicious anaemia is diagnosed, most patients respond well to treatment through quarterly intramuscular injection of vitamin B12. Whilst some patients with pernicious anaemia might prefer to have more frequent injections, or for other forms of vitamin B12 to be self-administered, these are matters for individual patients to discuss with their general practitioners (GPs). It is for clinicians, not the Department, to specify regimes of clinical care.</p><br /><p>The Department has made no specific assessment of the benefits of allowing easier access to vitamin B12. Any patients with pernicious anaemia who have concerns about their treatment should discuss this matter with their GP.</p><br /><p>The treatment of pernicious anaemia is well established and reported in the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) document, <em>Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Cobalamin and Folate disorders</em>, which was updated in May 2014. The BCSH operates independently of Department and NHS England. Cobalamin status is the recommended first line diagnostic test and is widely available. The guidance states that the clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of the test results. The guidelines can be found at the following link: <a href="http://www.bcshguidelines.com/" target="_blank">www.bcshguidelines.com</a></p><br /><p>Current clinical practice within the United Kingdom is to treat pernicious anaemia with Vitamin B12 intramuscular injections. The BCSH produces evidence based guidelines for both clinical and laboratory haematologists on the diagnosis and treatment of haematological disease, drawing on the advice of expert consultants and clinical scientists practicing in the United Kingdom.</p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison","16902 ; 16903","2015-11-23T16:35:47.497Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/429078/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/429078/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/429078/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-11-18","Anaemia","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what recent assessment his Department has made of the appropriate frequency with which people with pernicious anaemia should receive vitamin B12 replacement injections; what the guidelines are for GPs on granting requests by individual patients for injections to be administered more frequently than prescribed; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Mr Laurence Robertson","Tewkesbury","Mr Laurence Robertson","16897"
