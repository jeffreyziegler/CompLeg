That is why we have taken the following steps to support the quality of early years provision:</p><p> </p><ul><li>The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) helps early years providers to prepare young children for school and improve their life chances by requiring them to deliver high-quality provision. The 2014-15 EYFS Profile results show that the proportion of children achieving a good level of development continues to increase – 66% in 2015, compared to 60% in 2014, and 52% in 2013.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>We work closely with Ofsted to ensure a robust regulatory and inspection framework to drive continuous improvement in quality. The sector has responded very positively and the latest statistics show that 86% of early years providers were rated “good” or “outstanding” as of 31 March 2016.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>The quality of the workforce continues to improve, with 87% of staff in full day care settings now qualified to level 3 (equivalent level of study to A-level). We are developing a workforce strategy that will aim to remove barriers to attracting, retaining and developing staff.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>From September 2016, all newly qualified level 2 and level 3 staff must also have paediatric first aid training if they are to count in the EYFS staff:child ratios. This will mean an extra 15,000 staff a year coming into the sector with first aid training, providing vital reassurance to parents that their children will be well cared for.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>We have also introduced the Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP). Each eligible child will is funded for an EYPP of 53p per hour on top of the rate currently paid for the funded entitlement. This amounts to over £300 a year for a child taking up the full entitlement. Providers have flexibility about how they spend this money in order to improve the quality of provision for eligible children, but are held to account by Ofsted for using it effectively.</li></ul>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2016-07-25T14:47:58.757Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/536669/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/536669/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/536669/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-07-15","Children: Day Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps her Department is taking to improve the quality of early education and childcare.","false","Biography information for Judith Cummins","Bradford South","Judith Cummins","42944"

Under the Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) system, local authorities are required to review and assess air quality in their areas and to designate Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) and put in place Air Quality Action Plans (AQAP) to address air pollution issues where national air quality objectives are not being met. The LAQM system encourages local authorities to focus on local hotspots and to deploy resources and actions quickly to achieve cleaner air in their area.</p><p> </p><p>There are currently 25 AQMAs declared in the Greater London area for PM exceedances. Both Glasgow and Scunthorpe have one AQMA each declared for PM exceedances. All these AQMAs were declared before 2011 and all are still in place, with relevant AQAPs to address the issue. There are currently no PM related AQMAs in Port Talbot, Stanford-le-Hope, Leeds, Eastbourne, Nottingham, Southampton and Oxford.</p><p> </p><p>The Government’s ambition is for the UK to have the best natural environment anywhere.

Those who commit a crime while on licence face prosecution and potentially more time in prison. For serious offences, they can be held in prison on remand until trial.</p><p>The figures provided in the tables below refer to offenders serving a sentence of less than 12 months who have been released and subsequently recalled. These offenders became subject to supervision and licence conditions only as a result of the commencement of the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014 (ORA) in February 2015. Prior to this, such offenders were released unconditionally.</p><p>Throughout the period covered by the data, the number of offenders subject to the new provisions has steadily increased. This is because the ORA requirement applied only to those sentenced after commencement.
