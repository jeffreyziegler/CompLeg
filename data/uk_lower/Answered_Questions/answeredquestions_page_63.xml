Generous financial incentives are offered for languages teaching, including scholarships in MFLs worth £28,000, and tax-free bursaries, typically worth up to £26,000. The government is working in partnership with Spain’s Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to deliver Spain’s Visiting Teachers Programme to provide schools with access to a pool of qualified teachers from Spain who are able to teach MFLs. For the 2019/20 academic year. This programme will be open to secondary schools and also (as a pilot) to primary schools. In addition to this, the Teacher Subject Specialism Training programme aims to improve the subject knowledge of non-specialist teachers and returning teachers in MFLs and increase the number of hours taught.</p><p>The department has also recently launched the new Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy, which will attract new teachers to all subjects, including MFLs.</p><p>The department continues to promote the value of language qualifications to students who are choosing their GCSEs and to their parents.

The length of an award is based on an individual’s circumstances and can vary from nine months to an on-going award, with a light touch review after ten years.</p><p>We introduced updated guidance for case managers and an updated PIP Assessment Guide in 2018 which will ensure that those people who receive the highest level of support under PIP, and where their needs are unlikely to change or may get worse, will now receive an ongoing award with a light touch review at the ten-year point. In line with PIP’s aim to be needs-based rather than condition-based, the change to the guidance is not condition specific. However, we believe the changes will ensure that those with severe and/or progressive conditions receive the most appropriate award duration that reflects their condition and the needs arising.</p>","Truro and Falmouth","Sarah Newton",,"2019-03-13T15:39:10.71Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1082364/answer","Biography information for Sarah Newton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1082364/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1082364/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2019-03-05","Personal Independence Payment: Chronic Illnesses","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if she will make it her policy to end regular reviews of personal independence payment for claimants of working age with (a) motor neurone disease, (b) other degenerative conditions and (c) lifelong conditions which are unlikely to improve; and if she will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Caroline Lucas","Brighton, Pavilion","Caroline Lucas","228653"

This set out 61 commitments that the Government will be is taking forward to tackle violent crime. This includes new legislation in the Offensive Weapons Bill, currently in the House of Lords, strengthening police capability to act against violent crime, and a strong focus on prevention and early intervention to stop more working with young people to encourage them to take up positive activities rather than getting involved in crime, including serious violence. The Bill is also introducing new Knife Crime Prevention Orders.</p><p><br>Alongside the legislative measures in the Bill we are taking forward a number of other actions including a national knife crime media campaign - #knifefree - supporting intervention work in Hospital A&amp;E departments by expanding our support to Redthread to introduce its youth violence intervention work to include in hospitals in Birmingham and Nottingham, as well as in London, to work with young people admitted with knife wounds. In May 2018, we launched a new round of the anti-knife crime Community Fund as part of the Government’s commitment to early intervention and prevention to tackle serious violence. We announced the successful 68 projects in bids on 2 August 2018 with total who are receiving funding of £1.5 million in total, to support grass roots projects focused on prevention and early intervention.</p><p><br>In addition, the Government continues to encourage police forces to undertake a series of coordinated national weeks of action to tackle knife crime under Operation Sceptre. The operation includes targeted stop and searches, weapon sweeps of hotspot areas, test purchases of knives from retailers, and educational events. The week commencing 17 September 2018 marked the most recent week of action under Operation Sceptre, and it is expected that the next phase will take place from 11-17 March.</p><p><br>Last October the Home Secretary announced further measures to address violent crime including a consultation on new legal duty to underpin a ‘public health’ approach to tackling serious violence, a new £200 million youth endowment fund and an Independent review of drug misuse.</p><p><br>We have made significant progress in delivering on our key commitments including:</p><p><br>• a new £22m Early Intervention Youth Fund to support communities for early intervention and prevention with young people;<br>• a new £3.6m National County Lines Co-ordination Centre to tackle violent and exploitative criminal activity associated with county lines. The NCLCC has co-ordinated two separate weeks of intensive <br>• law enforcement action which has led to more than 1,000 arrests, over 1300 individuals safeguarded, and significant seizures of weapons and drugs;</p><p><br>• the Offensive Weapons Bill, currently in the House of Lords, is also introducing new Knife Crime Prevention Orders;<br>• £1.4m to support a new national police capability to tackle gang related activity on social media which will be fully operational later this year;<br>• established a cross party, cross sector, Serious Violence Taskforce which is chaired by the Home Secretary to oversee and drive this critical programme of work</p><p><br>• We have also agreed a set of commitments with major retailers to prevent the underage sales of knives more generally in their stores and online. The agreement also covers staff training and displays and packag-ing. Tesco, eBay UK, Lidl UK, Amazon UK, Wilko, Argos, Asda, Pound-land, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, John Lewis and Waitrose have all signed up to the principles. They have since been joined by Boots, the Co-op, B&amp;Q, Aldi, TKMaxx and Debenhams. In addition, as part of the Serious Violence Strategy we will support Trading Standards if they decide to prosecute a case in court through a specific prosecution fund</p><p>In addition, the following measures are being introduced:</p><p><br>• a new £200 million youth endowment fund. This will be delivered over 10 years and will support interventions with children and young peo-ple at risk of involvement in crime and violence. It will focus on those most at risk, such as those displaying signs such as truancy, aggression and involvement in anti-social behaviour; funding interventions to steer children and young people away from becoming serious offenders. In December 2018, we launched the bidding process to choose an organisation or consortium that will run and administer the fund. The deadline for submissions was 23 January and we are now assessing the bids received; and,<br>• an Independent review of drug misuse, which is being led by Dame Carol Black. This will ensure law enforcement agencies and policy are targeting and preventing the drug-related causes of violent crime effectively. Drugs have been identified as a major driver of serious violence and this review will look at recreational drug use, as well as considering use by the small number of users who cause the most harm to themselves and their communities.</p>",,"Baroness Williams of Trafford",,"2019-03-18T17:41:33.277Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1081672/answer","Biography information for Baroness Williams of Trafford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1081672/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1081672/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-03-04","Knives: Crime","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what consideration they are giving to the introduction of emergency measures in England and Wales to deal with knife crime.","false","Biography information for Lord Ouseley",,"Lord Ouseley","HL14205"
