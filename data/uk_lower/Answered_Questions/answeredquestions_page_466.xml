Supported by the Government's investment of £1 billion in HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, HMRC has secured over £77 billion in compliance yield since the start of this Parliament. As part of this, since April 2010 HMRC has secured around £31billion from large businesses.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/105964","Department of Health","false","2014-11-10","<p>In July 2012, the Government set out its vision of the development of high quality care services in the White Paper, <a href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8378/8378.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Caring for our future: Reforming care and support</em></a>. This was reinforced in the Care Act. It set out clearly the care and support system we want to achieve – with the support of care and support organisations, charities, carers, volunteers and the public. The Adult Social Care Workforce programme supports delivery of this vision, through increasing capacity, improving capability and developing leadership.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the recommendation of the Cavendish report into the failings at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, we are introducing the new Care Certificate, to help ensure that healthcare assistants, social care support workers and their employers can deliver a consistently high quality standard of care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Health Education England, Skills for Care and Skills for Health launched the pilot for the Care Certificate on 28 April 2014. The pilot is taking place across a range of health and social care settings, and, subject to evaluation, the national introduction of the Care Certificate is planned for March 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In order to make sure that people are held to account for the quality of care they provide, we are introducing measures to ensure that company directors who consent or turn a blind eye to poor care will be liable for prosecution. In the future, they and provider organisations could face unlimited fines if found guilty.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To ensure that social care providers and services employ and are run by people with the right values and skills, we are introducing a ‘fit and proper person’ test for Directors. Where the Care Quality Commission (CQC) considers a Director not to be fit to run a provider organisation, it will be able to insist on his or her removal.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government realised that the regulation and inspection of social care provision needed to improve. As a result, the CQC has introduced a new system of inspection of social care providers, backed by new fundamental standards of care. This new system of inspection is based on five important questions that matter most to people: whether services are safe, caring, effective, well-led and responsive to their needs. CQC inspections now result in a provider being rated on a four-point scale - ‘outstanding’, ‘good’, ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’, for each of the five domains that it inspects. This results in clear, straightforward information that commissioners of services and the public can understand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The new inspections are carried out by expert inspection teams, which include people who have personal experience of care. The CQC piloted the new approach from April 2014 and began to inspect and rate all providers against the new standards in October.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the Care Act, local authorities will have a new market shaping duty, meaning that they should work with local people and communities and engage with their local care providers to facilitate a diverse supply of high quality services.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care Act reforms should increase transparency and support more effective competition in local care markets. This will help providers of high quality care to attract more people and to grow and diversify their share in the market.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have just issued statutory guidance to local authorities about their new market shaping duties.

We are keen to move commissioning from a “time and task” based to an outcomes-driven activity.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Employers are responsible for ensuring that any potential employee has the required level of communication skills for their role. It is essential that a workers’ command of English should be considered as part of the recruitment process. Under CQC’s current approach to inspection and regulation, it is stipulated that workers in adult social care should be able to communicate effectively with people who use services and other staff and to ensure that care, treatment and support of service users is not compromised.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/105967","Department of Health","false","2014-11-10","<p>In July 2012, the Government set out its vision of the development of high quality care services in the White Paper, <a href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8378/8378.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Caring for our future: Reforming care and support</em></a>. This was reinforced in the Care Act. It set out clearly the care and support system we want to achieve – with the support of care and support organisations, charities, carers, volunteers and the public. The Adult Social Care Workforce programme supports delivery of this vision, through increasing capacity, improving capability and developing leadership.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the recommendation of the Cavendish report into the failings at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, we are introducing the new Care Certificate, to help ensure that healthcare assistants, social care support workers and their employers can deliver a consistently high quality standard of care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Health Education England, Skills for Care and Skills for Health launched the pilot for the Care Certificate on 28 April 2014. The pilot is taking place across a range of health and social care settings, and, subject to evaluation, the national introduction of the Care Certificate is planned for March 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In order to make sure that people are held to account for the quality of care they provide, we are introducing measures to ensure that company directors who consent or turn a blind eye to poor care will be liable for prosecution. In the future, they and provider organisations could face unlimited fines if found guilty.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To ensure that social care providers and services employ and are run by people with the right values and skills, we are introducing a ‘fit and proper person’ test for Directors. Where the Care Quality Commission (CQC) considers a Director not to be fit to run a provider organisation, it will be able to insist on his or her removal.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government realised that the regulation and inspection of social care provision needed to improve. As a result, the CQC has introduced a new system of inspection of social care providers, backed by new fundamental standards of care. This new system of inspection is based on five important questions that matter most to people: whether services are safe, caring, effective, well-led and responsive to their needs. CQC inspections now result in a provider being rated on a four-point scale - ‘outstanding’, ‘good’, ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’, for each of the five domains that it inspects. This results in clear, straightforward information that commissioners of services and the public can understand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The new inspections are carried out by expert inspection teams, which include people who have personal experience of care. The CQC piloted the new approach from April 2014 and began to inspect and rate all providers against the new standards in October.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the Care Act, local authorities will have a new market shaping duty, meaning that they should work with local people and communities and engage with their local care providers to facilitate a diverse supply of high quality services.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care Act reforms should increase transparency and support more effective competition in local care markets. This will help providers of high quality care to attract more people and to grow and diversify their share in the market.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have just issued statutory guidance to local authorities about their new market shaping duties. Together with Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the Local Government Association, we are developing a series of commissioning standards to improve local authority commissioning practices and encourage more flexibility, allowing providers to engage with them in new ways. We are keen to move commissioning from a “time and task” based to an outcomes-driven activity.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Employers are responsible for ensuring that any potential employee has the required level of communication skills for their role. It is essential that a workers’ command of English should be considered as part of the recruitment process. Under CQC’s current approach to inspection and regulation, it is stipulated that workers in adult social care should be able to communicate effectively with people who use services and other staff and to ensure that care, treatment and support of service users is not compromised. This applies to all workers, whatever their background or nationality.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb",,"2014-11-10T18:10:54.9357335Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/105967/answer","Biography information for Norman Lamb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/105967/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/105967/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-11-03","Social Services","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what plans his Department has put in place to improve the level of English language proficiency required for providers of social care.","false","Biography information for Ms Nadine Dorries","Mid Bedfordshire","Nadine Dorries","212943"

At the time of ratification in May 1991, the UK made two reservations concerning Article 2 of the Convention. One of these reserved the right to refuse extradition if it appears, in relation to the offence(s) in respect of which a person's return is sought, that by reason of its trivial nature, or because the accusation is not made in good faith in the interests of justice, extradition would in all the circumstances be unjust or oppressive.

Crime is falling and offenders are going to prison for longer. This Government has taken action to end cautions culture, and to make sure serious offenders do not receive penalties seen as soft options.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are changing the law to ban ‘simple’ cautions for all of the indictable only offences - the most serious criminal offences which must be tried in the Crown Court including rape, manslaughter and robbery.</p><p>We are also banning ‘simple’ cautions for possession of any offensive weapon (including a knife), supplying Class A drugs and a range of sexual offences against children, including child prostitution and pornography.</p><p>We have also outlined a new approach to scrap all cautions, which is being piloted in Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and Leicestershire, with a view to being extended across the country.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The current simple cautions are a non-statutory disposal available to the police to dispose of any offence committed by an adult and are designed for dealing with low level, mainly first time offending.</p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice issues guidance on the process to be followed by the police when they are administering simple cautions for adult offenders. The latest guidance, issued in November 2013 following the Simple Cautions Review, states that the use of a simple caution for indictable only offences, such as rape, should only be given following authorisation by a senior police officer of at least the rank of Superintendent and the Crown Prosecution Service. These will be cases where there were exceptional circumstances which would mean that it was not in the public interest to prosecute.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is legislating in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to place statutory restrictions on the use of cautions for certain serious offences.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the number of simple cautions issued for rape, sexual offences and violent crimes, in England and Wales, from 2010 to 2013 (the latest available) can be found on the Ministry of Justice website and is available at the following link:-</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311455/cjs-outcomes-by-offence-2009-2013.xls" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311455/cjs-outcomes-by-offence-2009-2013.xls</a></p><p> </p><p>For rape offences</p><p> </p><p>Under “Offence” select rape of a female and rape of a male.</p><p> </p><p>For sexual offences</p><p> </p><p>Under “Offence type” select sexual offences.</p><p> </p><p>For violent crimes</p><p> </p><p>Under “Offence type” select violence against the person.</p><p> </p><p>Further information on Offenders cautioned by sex and type of offence, 2003 to 2013</p><p>Is available at the following link:-</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly-december-2013" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly-december-2013</a></p><p>Under “Out of court disposals” data is available at Table Q2d.</p><p> </p>","Hemel Hempstead","Mike Penning",,"2014-11-06T17:38:43.5836431Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/106012/answer","Biography information for Sir Mike Penning","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/106012/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/106012/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-03","Police Cautions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what estimate she has made of the number of police cautions issued for (a) rape, (b) sexual offences and (c) violent crimes in each year since 2010.","false","Biography information for Dan Jarvis","Barnsley Central","Dan Jarvis","213132"

The MoJ currently offers two types of reward and recognition: cash awards and voucher awards. Cash awards are payments of non-consolidated performance pay for amounts of up to £100 for a once-off contribution or payments of £100 - £500 for sustained outstanding contribution. Voucher awards are vouchers up to the value of £50 to recognise outstanding once-off contributions, or contributions which a benchmarking panel considers deserve recognition but do not warrant a higher payment. For the financial year April 2013 to March 2014 4,555 cash awards were made, the total value of which was £968,751. 21,898 vouchers were awarded, the total value of which was £639,260. Information on reward and recognition is collated on an annual basis so the data for March 2014 to date is not currently available. Like other organisations, we use a full range of pay and reward mechanisms which will reward exceptional performance from our staff both in year and for a sustained level of performance over the year. Both ensure responsible use of public money. Since 2010 we have reduced our spend on instant rewards by almost 30%, with significant saving for the taxpayer.","Bermondsey and Old Southwark","Simon Hughes",,"2014-11-10T16:37:09.5989983Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/106054/answer","Biography information for Simon Hughes","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/106054/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/106054/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-03","Pay","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many Instant Rewards of what value were given to his Department's officials in (a) 2013 and (b) 2014 to date.","false","Biography information for John Woodcock","Barrow and Furness","John Woodcock","213071"
