Across the whole programme we have been guided by the evidence, learning from the best of the Work Programme and Work Choice, and have set up the programme with high quality evaluation built in.</p><p>As the Government confirmed in its response to recommendation 7 of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, individuals, even with similar barriers or characteristics, can respond differently to those barriers, and so require tailored support. This is why we have elected to give providers considerable freedom in how they support claimants to move into lasting work rather than specify particular services. This is supported by a payment model which gives providers a strong incentive to deliver outcomes, including a price accelerator element which seeks to deliver better performance by increasing the return for investment for those who are harder to help.</p><p>The key area on recommendation 11 is to stress that “The Government announced in October 2017 that it no longer intends to extend Local Housing Allowance rates to social sector tenants and in particular to those living in supported housing. The Government has also made clear that it is keen to ensure that those living in supported housing, and those who provide it, receive appropriate protection.

To this end the Government established the Money Advice Service (MAS), which provides free-to-use financial guidance and coordinates the UK’s Financial Capability Strategy. This is a 10-year strategy which aims to gather evidence on the most effective interventions to improve people’s financial capability, and support and coordinate initiatives that are proven to work. As part of this strategy MAS will shortly publish plans to commission projects to help working age adults manage their money, which will include a focus on households on low incomes. The plans will also focus on the financial capability needs of children and young people at home, in school, and in community settings.</p><p>Moving forward, the Government is legislating to merge the functions of MAS with those of The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS) and Pension Wise, to create a Single Financial Guidance Body to simplify the existing public financial guidance landscape. The government’s commitment to improving people’s financial capability is reflected in the new body’s strategic function to develop and coordinate a national strategy to improve the financial capability of members of the public, which will build on and further progress MAS’s work.</p><p>It is also particularly important that children and young adults receive financial education to help them shape their financial habits later in life. This is why financial literacy was made statutory within the national curriculum in England in 2014, as part of the curriculum for citizenship education for 11-16 year olds.</p>","Salisbury","John Glen",,"2018-04-18T13:10:16.963Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/874867/answer","Biography information for John Glen","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/874867/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/874867/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2018-03-29","Financial Services: Education","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, what plans the Government has to increase access to financial education for people on low incomes.","false","Biography information for Robert Halfon","Harlow","Robert Halfon","135168"
