These key assumptions are published in the organisation’s Annual Report and Accounts. Clinical negligence costs relate to four indemnity schemes operated by NHS Resolution: Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST), which covers NHS providers of secondary health care, and the Existing Liabilities, Ex-Regional Health Authorities, and the Department of Health and Social Care’s Clinical schemes, all of which relate to legacy organisations.</p><p>The cost of clinical negligence claims covered by the figures in this response are damages, claimant legal costs, defence legal costs, and NHS Resolution’s administration costs. The costs reported here do not include costs incurred locally by NHS providers in dealing with claims, such as their own administration costs.</p><p>NHS Resolution’s Statement of Net Expenditure estimates costs of clinical negligence at £11.7 billion in its 2020-21 accounts.

NHS Resolution will also review its five-year forecasts again following the production of its 2018-19 Annual Report and Accounts, and any changes in the underpinning actuarial assumptions are likely to result in revised projections.

The announcement included the roll out of rapid diagnostic centres across the country to offer patients a range of tests in the same day with rapid access to results. These will be modelled on existing pilots and will mean fewer visits to general practitioners and hospitals, and faster referrals.

It addresses flaws in Working Tax Credits and Housing Benefit that provided full support to claimants reporting persistently low (or zero) earnings from self-employment. Only Universal Credit claimants with a work expectation will have a MIF applied to their Universal Credit. A claimant’s expected hours of work depends on their circumstances. Where a claimant has limitations on the hours they can reasonably be expected to work, their MIF level is reduced. This ensures the level of the MIF matches the work expectations of other claimants in similar circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>One of the announcements in Autumn Budget 2018 was that the 12-month start-up period, where claimants are exempt from the MIF, will be extended to all gainfully self-employed claimants, new to Universal Credit, or new to self-employment. We plan to introduce this from July 2019 with full implementation from September 2020. This will provide time for self-employed claimants to establish and grow their business, and strikes a balance between support for new business, not trapping claimants in poverty, and protecting public funds.</p><p> </p><p>Plans are in place for an evaluation of the MIF and a large-scale tracking survey of self-employed Universal Credit claimants with a MIF applied to their claim</p><p> </p><p>Universal Credit encourages all claimants with a work expectation to find and progress in work.

These attempt to provide statistical allocations of public spending according to where the benefits of that spend are accrued, although the complexity of transport networks means that it is not always possible to allocate transport spending on a ‘who benefits’ basis. Where this is the case, expenditure has been apportioned based on actual regional spend rather than where the benefit lies. This is particularly relevant for highways. Spend is also presented per head of local population, so this does not take account of the number of non-residents using the transport infrastructure.</p><p> </p><p>The latest CRA statistics, published by HM Treasury on 20th November 2018, are presented in the table below:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Public sector expenditure on transport per capita (£s nominal)</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p><strong>% change over 5 year period 2013/14 to 2017/18</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The North (NE, NW, Y&amp;H)</p></td><td><p>+64%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>London</p></td><td><p>+56%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><sup> </sup></em></p><p><em><sup>Note - </sup></em><em>In 2015/16, Network Rail was reclassified into the public sector and the full extent of their expenditure was included.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p>The benefits from spend on transport interventions will often accrue to people far beyond the residents of the immediate local area or region. When expenditure is presented on a “per head of population” (or “per capita”) basis, it does not account for the pressure that large numbers of commuters and visitors from outside of a region can add to the transport networks. For example, central London receives over 1 million arrivals by train during a typical day, many of which will come from outside the region.</p><p> </p><p>Higher investment figures looked at in isolation do not tell the full story, for example those travelling to and from London are more likely to experience crowding on their rail journeys.</p><p><em> </em></p><p>The statistics do not directly reflect Government’s investment decisions. Investment decisions are made based on a rigorous and fair appraisal process that allocates spending to the projects and programmes where it delivers the greatest value-for-money for taxpayers and passengers. For these reasons, the Department does not allocate funding to transport on a ‘per head of population’ basis. As part of a commitment in the Transport Investment Strategy, the Department recently published the Rebalancing Toolkit, which provides guidance on how the Department assesses how a programme or project fits with the objective of spreading growth across the country.</p><p> </p><p>We are committed to improving journeys for passengers in the North and are carrying out the biggest investment in transport in the region for a generation.

Everyone with the capability to succeed in HE should have the opportunity to benefit from a university education, regardless of background or where they grew up.</p><p>This year, record rates of English 18 year olds, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have entered full-time university. However, more could and should be done. That is why, in our first guidance to the Office for Students, we asked them to encourage providers, particularly the most selective, to make further progress in ensuring that disadvantaged and underrepresented students can access, participate and succeed in HE.</p><p>A new transparency condition will require HE providers to publish application, offer, acceptance, non-continuation and attainment rates by socio-economic background, gender and ethnicity. This will provide greater transparency and help drive fairness on admissions and outcomes.</p><p>Prior attainment is a critical driver of access to HE and the government has asked HE providers to take on a more direct role in helping to raise attainment in schools as part of their outreach activity. All universities are expected to help raise attainment and support school improvement, including through school sponsorship and by establishing new state schools.</p><p>The National Collaborative Outreach Programme (NCOP) targets those areas of the country where progression into HE is both low overall and lower than expected (given typical GCSE attainment rates), in order to increase the number of young people from under-represented groups who go into higher education.</p><p>The department’s Opportunity Areas initiative is part of the government’s national plan for dealing with social mobility through education. The government expects universities to actively engage in these areas, to tackle local barriers.</p><p>In addition, the department launched Opportunity North East – a £24 million investment to drive rapid and sustainable improvements in education, to tackle the key issues holding young people back.
