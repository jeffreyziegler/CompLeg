Cervical cancer in women under the age of 25 is very rare. Younger women often undergo natural and harmless changes in the cervix that screening would identify as cervical abnormalities, and in most cases these abnormalities resolve themselves without any need for treatment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cervical cancer is linked to a persistent infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a very common sexually transmitted infection. Since 2008, girls aged 12 and 13 have been offered the HPV vaccination, which immunises them against the most high risk strains of HPV. To start with, girls up to 18 were also vaccinated so the first girls to be vaccinated will be coming into the cervical screening programme next year as they are 23 and 24 now. This vaccine will reduce the already low rates of cervical cancer in these young women and mean they will be protected for many years.</p><p> </p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2014-12-08T15:08:42.19Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167061/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167061/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/167061/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-12-01","Cervical Cancer","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will make it his policy to make smear tests for cervical cancer available to all women over the age of 16 who are sexually active; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Gordon Henderson","Sittingbourne and Sheppey","Gordon Henderson","216687"

HMRC is the supervisory authority for most MSBs under the Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs). HMRC’s role is to maintain a register of these businesses and ensure they are aware of, and comply with, their requirements by having appropriate risk based AML controls in place. HMRC is taking an increasingly robust approach to supervision of the MSB sector - for example, it committed to double its supervisory interventions in the sector by April 2015.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166787","Ministry of Justice","false","2014-12-03","<p>Whilst crime is falling, since 2010 offenders are more likely to go to prison, and for longer. In 2013, of all offenders sentenced for indictable offences, 27% were sentenced to immediate custody, 23% to community sentences, 18% to a fine, and 12% to a Suspended Sentence Order. In 2013, for the first time in the period between 2003 and 2013, immediate custody was the most common disposal given for indictable offences.</p><p> </p><p>This Government is creating a tough justice system with severe penalties available for serious offenders. We have already introduced automatic life sentences for a second serious sexual or violent offence, and we are legislating to end automatic early release for child rapists, terrorists and dangerous offenders. Our radical reforms to rehabilitation will mean for the first time every offender leaving prison spends at least 12 months under supervision, where currently around 50,000 are released each year with no statutory support. This will start to address the scandalous gap that allows our most chaotic offenders to leave prison with no support or supervision to turn their lives around.</p><p> </p><p>Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the courts, within the maximum penalty set by Parliament for the offence. Courts have discretion to suspend an adult custodial sentence and since December 2012 have been able to suspend a sentence of two years or less, where previously only a sentence of 12 months or less could be suspended.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is clear that serious offences should always be brought to court and to ensure that there is increased public confidence in the justice system announced in November last year changes to police guidance. This revised guidance states simple cautions should not be given for indictable only offences, certain serious either way offences or repeat offenders unless there are exceptional circumstances and a senior police officer, as well as the CPS for certain cases, has agreed that a caution should be administered. We have legislated in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to put statutory restrictions on the use of cautions for serious offences and repeat offenders.</p><p> </p><p>The number of people cautioned and offenders sentences at all courts for the requested offences, in England and Wales, in each year from 2010 to 2013 (latest data available) are published on the Ministry of Justice website and can be viewed at the following link:-</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly-december-2013" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly-december-2013</a></p><p> </p><p>From the above link select “Outcome by offence” noting that: grievous bodily harm offences can be viewed under assault with intent to cause serious harm; causing death by reckless driving can be viewed under causing death by dangerous driving; and wounding or other acts endangering life can be viewed under other acts endangering life.</p>","Hemel Hempstead","Mike Penning",,"2014-12-03T17:42:23.23Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166787/answer","Biography information for Sir Mike Penning","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166787/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/166787/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-28","Sentencing","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, How many (a) suspended sentences, (b) cautions and (c) custodial sentences were handed down in each year since 2010 for (i) burglary, (ii) sexual assault, (iii) grievous bodily harm, (iv) rape, (v) manslaughter, (vi) attempted murder, (vii) forgery, (viii) fraud, (ix) theft of a motor vehicle, (x) theft from a person, (xi) robbery, (xii) sexual activity with a child under 16, (xiii) sexual activity with a child under 13, (xiv) sexual assault of a female, (xv) rape of a male, (xvi) rape of a female, (xvii) sexual assault on a male, (xviii) child abduction, (xix) abandoning children aged under two years, (xx) cruelty or neglect of children, (xxi) wounding or other acts endangering life, (xxii) causing death by aggravated vehicle-taking, (xxiii) causing death by driving while unlicensed or uninsured, (xxiv) causing death of a child or a vulnerable person, (xxv) causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, (xxvi) manslaughter due to diminished responsibility, (xxvii) causing death by reckless driving, (xxviii) threat or conspiracy to murder, (xxix) perverting the course of justice, (xxx) violent disorder, (xxxi) kidnapping, (xxxii) blackmail, (xxxiii) intent to supply a controlled drug, (xxxiv) possession of a controlled drug, (xxxv) criminal damage, (xxxvi) arson, (xxxvii) common assault, (xxxviii) dangerous driving and (xxxix) firearms offences.","false","Biography information for Sadiq Khan","Tooting","Sadiq Khan","216464"

The anticipated publication date for the revised guidelines is May 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department ran a national Be Clear on Cancer lung cancer campaign from May to July 2012 to raise awareness of persistent cough as a symptom of lung cancer and to encourage people with this symptom to visit their GP.

The CDS covers lung cancer and a number of other cancers. Following the pilot, Macmillan is now offering the tool free of charge to all GPs in the United Kingdom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In March 2012 NICE published the Lung cancer Quality Standard.

It was the Labour Ministers who had their hands in the taxpayer-funded cookie jar.</p><p>Indeed, in her answer of 6 May 2014, Official Report, <em>House of Lords</em>, Column 367W, my noble friend, Baroness Stowell, helpfully provided a breakdown of the £795,288 of hospitality spending from 2008-10 under the last Labour Government, which can be found online at:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://data.parliament.uk/DepositedPapers/Files/DEP2014-0697/PQ-2369_Library_deposit_HL_6297.docx" target="_blank">http://data.parliament.uk/DepositedPapers/Files/DEP2014-0697/PQ-2369_Library_deposit_HL_6297.docx</a></p><p>The Department does not routinely provide take-away food for its staff, so this information is not centrally held in the form requested.</p><p>I would observe that during the time the hon. Member was a special adviser at HM Treasury from 2004 to 2007 under the tutelage of the Rt. hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Gordon Brown), a total of £125,020 was spent on hospitality for Ministers (as cited in 17 December 2008, <em>Official Report</em>, Column 824W). Based on <em>The Economist’s</em> purchasing power parity index, this would have been sufficient to purchase 65,856 Big Macs. I hope the hon.
