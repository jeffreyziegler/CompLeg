It is the first British Government Department to announce such a ban. This ambitious target makes the FCO a leader in the fight against plastic pollution not just in the UK, but globally too. Since January the FCO has taken steps to remove avoidable single-use plastic from its UK catering outlets. For example, in its UK canteens, the FCO has switched plastic cutlery and food packaging and cups to biodegradable alternatives and provided additional glasses and china mugs to reduce waste. In early April in the UK we introduced a 50p 'latte levy' on single-use coffee cups which has increased the use of reusable cups from 3% of total hot drinks sales to 46%. In the year to date, our actions have reduced plastic waste from our UK catering operations by about 40% compared to the same period last year. We have requested all Heads of Mission overseas take similar action and are working with our suppliers to further reduce avoidable single-use plastics to enable us to meet the Foreign Secretary's target.</p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2018-05-04T13:04:16.407Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/892321/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/892321/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/892321/answer",,,,,,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2018-04-26","Foreign and Commonwealth Office: Plastics","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,  what steps his Department has taken to reduce its use of single-use plastics .","false","Biography information for Thelma Walker","Colne Valley","Thelma Walker","138550"

Two of the three EE sites in High Peak have planning permission. Commercial services are not currently provided from these masts as they have not yet been activated, but it is EE’s intention to do so when the sites are live.</p><p>In respect of EAS sites I can confirm that there are currently 3 sites proposed in High Peak, two of these are located at Snake Pass, and the other at Howden Reservoir. This may reduce to 2 pending planning authority engagement on site locations as 1 nominal location (Howden Reservoir) is close to the High Peak Constituency boundary and may move outside. These sites are in the early stages of Acquisition &amp; Design and therefore none have Heads Of Terms or planning permission approved and therefore have not progressed into build thus far.</p><p>To provide the necessary coverage for the emergency services, EE is building over 500 new sites. Up to 291 of these new sites will transfer to the Home Office at contract end. EE is paid a fixed fee for the ESN service and as such there is no site-by-site subsidy for these 291 sites. EE is making available early and extensive details of all shareable new sites, including locations, to other mobile network operators as soon as they have planning permission and terms have been agreed with the landlord. EE has provided details of 350 sites to date.</p><p>Separately the Home Office, through the EAS project, are delivering circa 292 individual sites.

Statistics show that the registration website is especially popular with younger people. Ahead of the 2017 General Election the Government supported the Electoral Commission’s campaign to encourage voter registration by sharing their campaign materials through existing government social media accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as our own networks. We also published reminder register to vote messages on our high traffic <a href="http://gov.uk/" target="_blank">GOV.UK</a> pages, such as DVLA and HMRC. In addition, last December, we published a Democratic Engagement Plan which sets out our priorities for raising awareness of democracy and participation in our democratic processes – including registering to vote – amongst a number of different groups, including young people. Linked to this work and the Suffrage Centenary celebrations we have launched a pack for parliamentarians, announced the recruitment and training of youth democracy ambassadors and will make a secondary schools resource for 13-16 year olds.
