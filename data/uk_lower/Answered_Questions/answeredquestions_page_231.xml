There has been no evidence that mainstream schools that increased EBacc entry results also decreased their arts entries. The 297 schools that increased their EBacc entry rates by 40 percentage points or more between 2011 and 2016, on average entered 48.6% of their pupils for at least one arts subject. This was almost the same proportion as other state funded schools (48.9%).</p><p> </p><p>There is a small positive correlation (0.12) between schools’ EBacc entries and arts entries, suggesting that schools where EBacc entry has increased tend to have also seen an increase in their arts uptake<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is too early to assess the effect of these changes on employment in the creative industries because pupils who have been taught since the introduction of the EBacc and who may have gone on to higher education will still be undergraduates. The Government is committed to ensuring that talented students have access to the support they need to help them succeed in careers in the arts and creative industries. Our Music and Dance Scheme and Dance and Drama Awards provide income-assessed support to ensure that the most talented children and young people from all backgrounds are able to receive the high quality training they need to succeed in careers in acting, music and dance.</p><p> </p><p>In the Culture White Paper published in March 2016, the Government committed to working with Arts Council England to understand the barriers that prevent people from lower income households and under-represented groups from pursuing a career in the arts.
