Nor were spending controls exercised on other areas such as procurement, advertising and marketing, and IT spend.</p><p>That's all changed and ministers - supported by Cabinet Office officials - now closely scrutinise what we spend on consultants and temporary labour. Departments saved over £1billion in 2012-13 (the last year for which we have audited figures) compared to the spending levels in the final year of the last administration, 2009-10. This helped us save taxpayers £10 billion in 2012-13 against a 2009-10 baseline.</p><p>We will continue to spend money on consultants and temporary labour when there is an appropriate business need to do so. Indeed in some cases engaging temporary labour is more flexible and cheaper for the taxpayer than taking on new staff. But we are also ensuring that the Civil Service has the skills needed. Our Capabilities Plan is designed to address long-standing gaps in four particular areas: digital skills, project management skills, commercial skills, and the leadership and management of change.</p><p>We publish all spend data over £25,000 and contracts over £10,000 on Gov.uk and Contracts Finder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Horsham","Mr Francis Maude","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/47337/answer",,,,,"195546 ; 195568 ; 195582","2014-04-29T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/47337/answer","Biography information for Lord Maude of Horsham","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/47337/answer",,,,,"53","Cabinet Office","Cabinet Office","2014-04-07","1","House of Commons","To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, which five companies were used most often to provide temporary workers for No. 10 Downing Street in the last financial year; and how much in agency fees was paid to each of them.","false","Biography information for Mr Chris Leslie","Nottingham East","Chris Leslie","195560"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46725","HM Treasury","false","2014-05-13","<p>The Government takes the enforcement of National Minimum Wage (NMW) very seriously and HMRC enforce the national minimum wage legislation on behalf of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and has done so since the introduction of NMW in April 1999. It does that by investigating all complaints made about employers suspected of not paying the minimum wage, in addition carrying out targeted enforcement where it identifies a high risk of non-payment of NMW across the whole of the UK.</p><p> </p><p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have a legal duty of confidentiality towards their customers. For NMW, this includes employers and their workers. This means that HMRC cannot supply all the information requested as this would breach HMRC's statutory duty of confidentiality under s18(1) of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005.</p><p> </p><p>Fines are associated with criminal offences. Where minimum wage arrears are identified for any pay reference periods starting on or after 6 April 2009, the employer will be charged an automatic penalty. The rate of the penalty charge was 50% of the arrears falling in pay periods after 6 April 2009 (minimum penalty charge was £100 and the maximum was £5,000).</p><p> </p><p>The Government has increased the financial penalty percentage from 50 per cent to 100 per cent of the unpaid wages owed to workers, and the maximum penalty from £5,000 to £20,000. These new limits are now in force where arrears are identified in pay reference periods on or after 7 March 2014. The Government will also bring in primary legislation as soon as possible so that the maximum £20,000 penalty can apply to each underpaid worker.</p><p> </p><p>To ensure that underpaid workers receive the arrears of national minimum wage due to them, HMRC contacts every employer for confirmation that they have paid the arrears to workers. In cases where 5 or fewer workers are owed arrears HMRC also contacts all those workers for confirmation of payment. In cases where more than 5 workers are identified as being owed arrears HMRC contacts an additional sample of workers for confirmation of payment.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC records information by Standard Industry Codes.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46856","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2014-05-06","<p> </p><p><em>[Holding Reply: Tuesday 8 April 2014]</em></p><p><em>Action on empty homes</em></p><p>The Coalition Government has a comprehensive package of policies to help get empty homes back into use. They include:</p><p>· A £235 million empty homes funding programme, which will deliver 12,000 homes from empty properties by March 2015 – with apprenticeships on offer to make this happen.</p><p>· Rewarding councils for bringing empty homes back into use through the New Homes Bonus – since April 2011, councils have received over £2.2 billion for bringing over 93,000 empty homes back into use, which they can then use to benefit the wider community.</p><p>· Giving councils new powers to remove council tax subsidies to empty homes, and use the funds to keep the overall rate of council tax down.</p><p>· Cancelling the last Administration's Pathfinder programme which sought to demolish homes, instead focusing on refurbishment and getting empty homes into use.</p><p><br> <em>The evidence base</em></p><p>This approach is working. The number of empty homes has fallen year-on-year since 2009, and at now at the lowest level since 2004. Similarly, the number of long-term vacant properties has fallen by around a third since 2009.</p><p>I note that Islington Borough Council's recent discussion paper on so-called “Buy to Leave” tried to use the electoral roll as a proxy for measurement – yet many UK residents of foreign nationality may not be legally eligible to be on the electoral roll, or it simply may not be a priority for such individuals to register.</p><p>Moreover, in relation to London, I have placed in the Library a table showing how the number of empty homes has fallen by 30 per cent since 2009 and by 18 per cent in the last year, including a breakdown by London borough, which broadly shows falls across both central, inner and outer London boroughs. Islington has seen a drop in the number of empty homes of 26 per cent since 2009.</p><p>In that context, the evidence that “Buy to Leave” is a widespread problem is weak. Fundamentally, even where property is purchased by someone of foreign nationality, it will generally be either occupied or rented out, generating an ongoing return for the investor. It is not particularly rational for any investor not to rent out an unused flat and lose rental income, given the strong demand for private rented accommodation, especially in London.</p><p><em>The small number of foreign buyers</em></p><p>Even then, the Bank of England recently estimated that foreign buyers represent just 3% of total residential property transactions in London (Bank of England, <em>Financial Stability Report</em>, November 2013). Knight Frank have estimated that between 85% and 90% of new-build sales in Greater London are sold to domestic buyers, and there is no indication of a shift towards higher non-resident purchases in the last two years (Knight Frank, <em>International Buyers in London</em>, October 2013). Savills have reported that the proportion of sales to overseas buyers in ‘prime' London markets is no higher than it was in 1990. But they also estimate that, in 2012, foreign investment helped to finance 3,000 new affordable homes and added a further 3,000 much needed new homes to the market-rented sector (Savills, <em>Spotlight: The World in London</em>, 2013).</p><p><em>How foreign investment helps build new housing</em></p><p>Both domestic and foreign investment in new housing has been helping to provide the finance needed to build it, particularly in a global city like London. Without upfront investment, financiers would not have released the cash needed for development to go ahead, and building would have stalled. These new developments not only provide homes for people to live and work, they also unlock associated affordable housing development. A good example is the Battersea Power Station redevelopment which, having laid derelict for thirty years, is now being taken forward thanks to the combination of private investment from Malaysia and public infrastructure support from the UK Government. Both were essential to move the project forward.</p><p><em>Marketing new build to local residents</em></p><p>I would add that the Government has actively encouraged the property industry to ensure that homes for sale are marketed in the United Kingdom, and not solely overseas. In response, the Home Builders Federation announced in December 2013 a new industry initiative which commits signatories to ensure that housing developments in London are marketed in the UK either at the same time as, or in advance of, any overseas launch.</p><p>The Mayor of London has also recently launched a Mayoral Concordat on new homes in the capital, writing to key developers across the UK, asking them to sign up to commit to selling new homes on every development to Londoners before, or at the same time as they are available to overseas buyers. The Concordat is already supported by the Major Developer Group, London First, the London Chamber of Commerce and the Home Builders Federation and signed by fifty developers in London.</p><p><em>Tackling tax avoidance</em></p><p>Of course, it is important that overseas owners of property pay their way. That is why this Government has taken action to tackle tax avoidance by reforming taxation of higher-value UK residential property held by non-natural persons, and also levelling the playing field by introducing capital gains tax on future gains made by non-residents disposing of UK residential property. Last month's Budget took further steps to discourage the use of corporate envelopes to invest in high value housing to avoid paying tax.</p><p><em>More new housing to buy and rent</em></p><p>As well as tackling empty homes, the Government's long-term economic plan is increasing investment and building more homes. According to the NHBC, in 2013, new housing registrations rose by 30 per cent in England on the year before and registrations are the highest since 2007; in London, new registrations rose 60 per cent, the highest annual total since their records began 26 years ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p>","Keighley","Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46856/answer",,,,,,"2014-05-06T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46856/answer","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46856/answer","Keighley","Kris Hopkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/46856/answer/previousversion/5260","Biography information for Kris Hopkins","7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-04-03","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what assessment has he made of the effect of buy-to-leave investments on the proportion of homes standing empty.","false","Biography information for Chi Onwurah","Newcastle upon Tyne Central","Chi Onwurah","195186"

The guidance, which is a material consideration in planning decisions, explains that section 11A(2) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 requires authorities to ‘have regard' to the purpose of National Parks ‘in exercising or performing any functions in relation to, or so as to affect, land' in National Parks.

This is supported through measures in a number of areas which will enhance energy security further whilst also delivering wider energy goals.</p><p> </p><p>These measures include resilience measures to prevent possible disruptions ranging from flooding through to industrial action, and to reduce the impact of incidents if they do occur and energy efficiency measures to lower our exposure to domestic and international energy market risks.
