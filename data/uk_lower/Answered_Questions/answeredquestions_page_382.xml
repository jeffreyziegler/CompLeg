During an inspection, the CQC asks five questions of every service and provider; are they safe, effective, caring, well led and responsive to people’s needs. Following an inspection the CQC rates a provider on a four point scale running from outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate. In addition to an aggregate rating at a provider level, the CQC produces ratings for individual services and locations. This gives patients and the public a fair, balanced and easy to understand assessment of performance of a provider.</p><br /><p>Where a provider is rated as inadequate the Chief Inspector of Hospitals can recommend that the trust be placed into special measures. This means that trusts receive a tailored package of support to enable them to improve.</p><br /><p>As of 8 December there are 15 trusts in special measures. Eleven trusts have made sufficient progress to exit special measures, the most recent being the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust on 4 December.</p><br /><p>On 15 October 2015, the CQC published its State of Care Report 2014-15 and reported:</p><br /><p>* 83%1 of all providers agree that the new inspections helped them to monitor the quality of care they provide;</p><br /><p>* 73%1 of all providers said that a CQC inspection had helped to identify areas of improvement and 72% said that the inspection reports were useful; and</p><br /><p>* 68%1 of all providers said that they thought that outcomes for people who use services were improved as result of CQC inspection activity.</p><br /><p>1 The information provided in the State of Care report is for all registered providers not just Hospitals.</p>","Ipswich","Ben Gummer",,"2015-12-08T16:28:43.56Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/433240/answer","Biography information for Ben Gummer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/433240/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/433240/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-11-30","Hospitals: Standards","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what assessment he has made of the effect of the new Care Quality Commission inspection regime on hospital performance; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Caroline Ansell","Eastbourne","Caroline Ansell","18136"

The House has not yet been invited to respond to this recommendation. House officials have undertaken some preparatory studies in the event of the House deciding to endorse this proposal. Members wishing to pursue the issue can seek a debate via the Backbench Business Committee or raise it with the Procedure Committee. It would also be open to Ministers to bring forward proposals.</p><p>Accurate recording of divisions and timely publication of division lists are critical business activities of the House of Commons. The House Service has therefore been investigating means of electronic recording of divisions since October 2014, with a view to improving the timely publication of division lists, making division data more accessible to the public and easier to analyse, and improving accuracy. A trial was held in the House in March 2015 in which seven divisions were recorded in part by division clerks on tablet devices. Full implementation of tablet recording of divisions is expected to take place early in 2016. In the meantime, any divisions held under the new English votes for English laws procedure will be recorded on tablet devices, because the tablets can generate the results required under the ‘double-majority’ system.
