"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724","HM Treasury","false","2016-09-12","<p>Funeral expenses insurance is a commercial product and the Government does not believe it would be appropriate to interfere in the market in the way the Honourable Member for Glasgow South describes. The respective capabilities of insurers to assess risk is a key element on which they compete and helps to ensure there is a diversity of products and efficient pricing in the market.</p><p> </p><p>Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism. At a basic level insurers group together large numbers of people, who all face a similar risk, and collect money from each of them through premiums. This pooling principle lies behind funeral cover insurance policies. These protect policyholders from the risk of dying early and not having accumulated the level of savings they would wish to leave behind to cover the costs of their funeral. The premiums of those who live long enough to contribute more than they would receive in benefits from the policy are used to pay the shortfall from those who die earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Therefore it is possible for those with funeral cover insurance to pay more in premiums than they will receive in benefits. An alternative option to such insurance would be to save this money which would mean an individual would not receive less than they put in. However they would then face the risk that, should they die earlier than expected, they would not have accumulated as much in savings as they would have received in benefits from an insurance policy.</p><p>It is important that consumers understand the nature of their funeral cover insurance policies. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the insurance industry, has produced an Insurance Conduct of Business Sourcebook (ICOBS) in order to set the standards required of insurance firms in relation to their business. ICOBS rules include a requirement that customers are given all the appropriate information required to make an informed decision ahead of purchasing an insurance product. The rules also state that communications should be clear, fair and not misleading. This means that where there is a possibility that a funeral plan may pay out less than was paid in, this must be clearly disclosed to the consumer before they purchase the product.</p><p> </p>","Brighton, Kemptown","Simon Kirby",,"2016-09-12T11:11:13.097Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724/answer","Biography information for Simon Kirby","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2016-09-06","Funerals: Insurance","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will take legislative steps to prohibit funeral expenses insurance plans from paying out less to customers than has been paid in.","false","Biography information for Stewart Malcolm McDonald","Glasgow South","Stewart Malcolm McDonald","45188"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576918","Department for Transport","false","2016-09-13","<p>Rail passengers should always be able to get the best deal and the industry must work harder to make this a reality. We are aware that there are a number of routes for which it can be cheaper to purchase two or more tickets for individual parts of the route than a through ticket for the entire journey. Anyone is entitled to purchase two or more separate tickets for their journey so long as the train they are travelling on stops at the stations indicated at the end of each ticket. Apparent anomalies in pricing that may be experienced on long-distance routes like London to Scotland, can sometimes be a result of competition on the railways encouraging one operator to reduce prices when competing with others on the route. Price competition on the railways can be positive for passengers. The Department would need to consider very carefully any action that removed this incentive for operators.</p><p> </p><p>Train operators are obliged to sell the most appropriate through fare based on the information the passenger gives them. This will depend on what time the passenger wants to travel and how flexible they need to be. The National Rail Conditions of Carriage, which form the basis of the contract you enter into when you buy a rail ticket, allow passengers to use combinations of tickets. However, it is vital that industry improve information available to passengers and I will be raising this with the Rail Delivery Group as a priority.</p>","Blackpool North and Cleveleys","Paul Maynard",,"2016-09-13T09:51:00.593Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576918/answer","Biography information for Paul Maynard","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576918/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576918/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2016-09-06","Railways: Scotland","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what steps the Government is taking to simplify rail fares for journeys between London and Scotland and reduce the fare anomalies that lead to split ticketing.","false","Biography information for Drew Hendry","Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey","Drew Hendry","45193"

The UK has successfully lobbied for the EU-wide adoption of the existing UK ban on trade in raw ivory tusks, which was agreed through European Council Conclusions on an EU Action Plan on Wildlife Trafficking adopted in June. Trade in such tusks presents the greatest risk of poached ivory entering the legal market. In addition, these conclusions urged EU Member States to consider further measures to put a halt to commercial trade in ivory from elephants.</p><p> </p><p>A substantial number of proposals on elephant and ivory related issues will be discussed at the Conference of Parties to CITES to be held in South Africa between 24 September and 5 October 2016. This will include discussions on the existing global ban on the trade in ivory, which the UK is committed to maintaining, and the role of domestic ivory markets in illegal trade. The UK is, and will continue to, play a full role in these discussions.</p><p> </p><p>In relation to the confirmation by the USA Government to limit commercial trade in African elephant ivory to items more than 100 years old, with some exemptions, the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Environment and Rural Affairs, Rory Stewart, discussed this issue with the USA Government during a trip earlier this year. In addition officials in Defra are in regular contact with their US counterparts and have discussed the US measures on a number of occasions.</p><p> </p><p>Finally on the Elephant Protection Initiative, this has grown from 5 to 14 members since the London Conference in February 2014. A Ministerial-level meeting of members to agree governance arrangements took place in Addis Ababa in September 2015. Range states have been supported to develop their National Elephant Action Plans and through these a number of priority conservation projects have been funded.</p>",,"Lord Gardiner of Kimble","HL1614 ; HL1615 ; HL1616 ; HL1617","2016-09-20T14:25:33.327Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/577021/answer","Biography information for Lord Gardiner of Kimble","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/577021/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/577021/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2016-09-06","Elephants: Conservation","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majestyâs Government what progress has been made to implement the Elephant Protection Initiative since it was launched at the London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade in 2014.","false","Biography information for Lord Hague of Richmond",,"Lord Hague of Richmond","HL1618"

In this report, the MAC established the key role played by skilled migrants in raising productivity. Further, the 2014 MAC report, âMigrants in low-skilled workâ, found low skilled migrants have a neutral impact on UK-born employment rates, GDP per head and productivity.
