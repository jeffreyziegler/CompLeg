"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724","HM Treasury","false","2016-09-12","<p>Funeral expenses insurance is a commercial product and the Government does not believe it would be appropriate to interfere in the market in the way the Honourable Member for Glasgow South describes. The respective capabilities of insurers to assess risk is a key element on which they compete and helps to ensure there is a diversity of products and efficient pricing in the market.</p><p> </p><p>Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism. At a basic level insurers group together large numbers of people, who all face a similar risk, and collect money from each of them through premiums. This pooling principle lies behind funeral cover insurance policies. These protect policyholders from the risk of dying early and not having accumulated the level of savings they would wish to leave behind to cover the costs of their funeral. The premiums of those who live long enough to contribute more than they would receive in benefits from the policy are used to pay the shortfall from those who die earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Therefore it is possible for those with funeral cover insurance to pay more in premiums than they will receive in benefits. An alternative option to such insurance would be to save this money which would mean an individual would not receive less than they put in. However they would then face the risk that, should they die earlier than expected, they would not have accumulated as much in savings as they would have received in benefits from an insurance policy.</p><p>It is important that consumers understand the nature of their funeral cover insurance policies. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the insurance industry, has produced an Insurance Conduct of Business Sourcebook (ICOBS) in order to set the standards required of insurance firms in relation to their business. ICOBS rules include a requirement that customers are given all the appropriate information required to make an informed decision ahead of purchasing an insurance product. The rules also state that communications should be clear, fair and not misleading. This means that where there is a possibility that a funeral plan may pay out less than was paid in, this must be clearly disclosed to the consumer before they purchase the product.</p><p> </p>","Brighton, Kemptown","Simon Kirby",,"2016-09-12T11:11:13.097Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724/answer","Biography information for Simon Kirby","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576724/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2016-09-06","Funerals: Insurance","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will take legislative steps to prohibit funeral expenses insurance plans from paying out less to customers than has been paid in.","false","Biography information for Stewart Malcolm McDonald","Glasgow South","Stewart Malcolm McDonald","45188"

The intention is to enable customers to apply online across the services and immigration routes in a straight-forward and customer-focused way.</p><p>The online application service Access UK first launched for visit visa customers in China in June 2014, and has subsequently been rolled out to 180 countries globally for overseas visit routes in more than 15 languages. For those already in the UK, Access UK has launched for customers applying for tier 2 (work) and tier 4 (study) extensions and is preparing for further services to go online. UKVI is currently trialling the online service for some EEA applicants. As the programme matures we expect benefits to security, customer service and efficiencies to be identified and realised.</p>","Scarborough and Whitby","Mr Robert Goodwill","45158","2016-09-13T12:13:48.5Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576882/answer","Biography information for Mr Robert Goodwill","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576882/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576882/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2016-09-06","Immigration: Internet","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment she has made of the feasibility of processing applications for registration certificates and residence cards through an online system; and if she will estimate the potential savings in administration costs to the public purse of such a system.","false","Biography information for Stuart C.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/576918","Department for Transport","false","2016-09-13","<p>Rail passengers should always be able to get the best deal and the industry must work harder to make this a reality. We are aware that there are a number of routes for which it can be cheaper to purchase two or more tickets for individual parts of the route than a through ticket for the entire journey. Anyone is entitled to purchase two or more separate tickets for their journey so long as the train they are travelling on stops at the stations indicated at the end of each ticket. Apparent anomalies in pricing that may be experienced on long-distance routes like London to Scotland, can sometimes be a result of competition on the railways encouraging one operator to reduce prices when competing with others on the route. Price competition on the railways can be positive for passengers. The Department would need to consider very carefully any action that removed this incentive for operators.</p><p> </p><p>Train operators are obliged to sell the most appropriate through fare based on the information the passenger gives them. This will depend on what time the passenger wants to travel and how flexible they need to be.

In this report, the MAC established the key role played by skilled migrants in raising productivity. Further, the 2014 MAC report, ‘Migrants in low-skilled work’, found low skilled migrants have a neutral impact on UK-born employment rates, GDP per head and productivity.
