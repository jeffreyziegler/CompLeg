Such children and young people may be diverse in terms of their country of origin, how long they have been in England and their previous experiences of formal education – so individual schools will be best placed to determine how to integrate pupils with refugee status most effectively into the life of the school.</p><p>Head teachers have flexibility in how they use the funding allocated to their schools in order to support and address the specific needs of their pupils – including those who are refugees (or seeking asylum). Refugee children may have English language development needs. Through the new national funding formula (NFF) for schools, which was introduced in April 2018, schools are allocated funding for pupils with English as an additional language (EAL) who have been in the school system in England for up to three years. The funding equates to an additional £515 per primary school pupil and an additional £1,385 per secondary school pupil by the time the formula is fully implemented. The mobility factor in the NFF also directs funding to schools in which more than 10% of pupils joined the school mid-way through the academic year.</p><p>Where appropriate, schools can also use their pupil premium funding to support refugee pupils who are classed as disadvantaged, or who are currently or have previously been in local authority care.</p><p>Unaccompanied asylum seeking children who arrive in the UK become looked-after children and therefore will be safeguarded and have their welfare promoted in the same way as any other looked-after child. Such children will have a Personal Education Plan, and social workers, Virtual School Heads (VSH) and Independent Reviewing Officers, school admission officers and special educational needs departments will work together to ensure that appropriate education provision for the child is arranged.</p><p> </p><p>The department has contributed £1.3 million through the Controlling Migration Fund over two years to fund eight diverse local authorities in providing better access to initial assessment and education for unaccompanied asylum seeking children. The local authorities will also use their delivery models to develop resources for this vulnerable cohort of looked-after children that can be easily shared with and used by other local authorities facing similar challenges. We are working with the VSH Network to support the development of the tools and resources as well as good practice examples and case studies of effective support, which are being cascaded through the VSH Network to all other local authorities looking after unaccompanied and refugee children.</p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi",,"2018-12-04T17:42:33.993Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1017219/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1017219/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1017219/answer",,,,,,,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-11-29","Schools: Refugees","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking to support the integration of refugee children that attend schools.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","197325"

However, it is too soon to estimate the size of this additional effect from available data.

A training programme will be made available free of charge initially.</p><p> </p><p>In a no deal scenario the increase in demand for EHCs is likely to be closer to 150% due to the imposition of full tariffs and requirement to enter via border inspection posts.

This includes tourism, which is a formal area of cooperation agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) under Strand II of the Belfast Agreement.</p><p>The Attorney-General’s legal commentary on the Agreement made clear that Article 13 does not alter the remit or functions of the NSMC or the North-South Implementation bodies, nor does it alter arrangements under Strand II of the 1998 Agreement in any way. The Protocol acknowledges that the UK and Ireland may continue to make new arrangements that build on the provisions of the 1998 Agreement in other areas of North-South cooperation on the island of Ireland. In accordance with the position set out in the recitals, the functions and safeguards of the Assembly and the NSMC (including cross-community provisions) will be respected in full.</p><p>Thus the Protocol and its recitals recognise that any new arrangements - whether expansion or diminution in areas of cooperation - are a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government alone, through the NSMC. The status, functions, and remit of Tourism NI and Tourism Ireland are completely unaffected.</p><p>It is important also to note that the Article also does not require any application of EU law in Northern Ireland. It is therefore exempt from the specific EU supervision and enforcement provisions set out in the Protocol. Cooperation will remain a matter for two sovereign jurisdictions on the island of Ireland to decide in accordance with the respective legal regimes.</p><p>The most significant effect of the Withdrawal Agreement in relation to tourism is to ensure that, under the Common Travel Area arrangements, individuals can continue to travel freely between the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and Ireland.</p><p> </p>","Daventry","Chris Heaton-Harris",,"2018-12-10T15:43:07.69Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016327/answer","Biography information for Chris Heaton-Harris","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016327/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1016327/answer",,,,,,,,,,,,"203","Exiting the European Union ","Exiting the European Union ","2018-11-28","Tourism Ireland: Tourism Northern Ireland","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, what assessment has been made of the effect on the operation of Tourism NI and Tourism Ireland of the proposed EU Withdrawal Agreement.","false","Biography information for Nigel Dodds","Belfast North","Nigel Dodds","196738"
