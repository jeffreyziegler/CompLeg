We selected Ofsted Requires Improvement (RI) as the single indicator to identify the long list of secondary phase schools in scope to become a ONE Vision school and, by exception<strong>, </strong>Ofsted Inadequate schools. We then shortlisted schools using a comprehensive review of their performance data, pupil demographics, Ofsted history and intelligence from local authorities and trusts on which schools were priorities for support. We made an initial offer of support to 32 schools, of which 30 accepted.</p><p>The support that each ONE Vision school receives will be bespoke to their individual circumstances. It will be determined by an analysis of need comprising an External Review of Governance, undertaken by a National Leader of Governance; a Financial Health Check, undertaken by a School Resource Management Adviser; and a School Development Review, undertaken by a National Leader of Education or other high performing school leader. This analysis will identify the schools’ main priorities for improvement.</p><p>The following table shows the number of pupils in 2017/18 (a) attending all state-funded mainstream schools in the North East who are in the region’s lowest quintile of Attainment 8 scores, and (b) attending ONE Vision Schools who are within the region’s lowest quintile of Attainment 8 scores.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Number of pupils in North East in lowest quintile[1] of Attainment 8 scores (state-funded mainstream schools[2])</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Number of pupils in North East in One Vision schools in lowest quintile<sup>1</sup> of Attainment 8 scores (state-funded mainstream schools<sup>2</sup>)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4,836</p></td><td><p>1,169</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>The following table shows the number of pupils in 2017/18 (a) attending all state-funded schools in the North East who are within the region’s lowest quintile of capped GCSE point scores, based on their best eight entries, and (b) attending ONE Vision Schools who are within the region’s lowest quintile of capped GCSE point scores, based on their best eight entries.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Number of pupils in North East in lowest quintile<sup>1</sup> of best eight entries scores (all state-funded schools)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Number of pupils in North East in One Vision schools in lowest quintile<sup>1</sup> of best eight entries scores (all state-funded schools)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4,879</p></td><td><p>1,135</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>It is a goal of the ONE Vision programme to build capacity in these 30 schools so that they are able to support other schools in the future.

If the court was not of that opinion (and the defendant was in custody for no other reason than that offence), it was obliged to discharge the defendant. Pursuant to a recommendation from the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1993, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 amended the committal provisions (with effect from March 1997) to exclude the possibility of oral evidence. The effect was therefore that magistrates' courts could consider only documentary evidence tendered by the prosecution when determining whether there the defendant should be committed for trial. The resulting paper-based committal proceedings were subsequently replaced by the present procedure in May 2013 when section 6 was repealed, with the result that there is no preliminary examination of the evidence in the magistrates’ court and cases are sent to the Crown Court when it appears to the magistrates’ court that the case is more suitable to be tried there.
