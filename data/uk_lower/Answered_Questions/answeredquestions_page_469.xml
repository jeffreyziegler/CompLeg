However, although DFDS Seaways made reference to the increased cost of marine fuel that would follow the introduction of the new sulphur limit in both cases, its announcements indicated that both routes had already been in decline because of other factors. The Government is not aware of any other such announcements from other ferry operators concerning route closures affecting UK ports.</p><p> </p><p>The Government published a draft impact assessment in April 2014, as part of the public consultation on the draft legislation. We received no detailed information from consultees about the likely effect on seafarer numbers, either in general or specifically in the North Sea and the English Channel, following the introduction of the 0.1% per cent sulphur limit.</p><p> </p><p>Approval of an Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS) would be undertaken by the vessel’s flag State in line with the internationally agreed guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organization. To date, no UK registered ferries have been fitted with type approved EGCS systems although the Government is aware of both ferries and large passenger vessels that call at the UK that have been fitted with type approved systems. Guidance for shipowners on EGCS has been developed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and consulted upon, with industry and others, and will be published alongside the final Regulations shortly.</p><p> </p><p>Enforcement will be carried out by the MCA as part of its existing enforcement activities, under a regime of proportionate and targeted compliance surveys. The proposed Regulations would provide sanctions for non-compliance. The MCA has discussed enforcement of the new requirements with other Members of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding. The UK has also been active in the European Sustainable Shipping Forum, established by the European Commission, which is developing guidelines to help inspectors enforce the new requirements on a consistent basis.</p><p> </p><p /> <p>The Government is looking at ways of helping industry meet the new regulatory requirements.

Programme budgeting returns are based on a subset of PCT accounts data and represent a subset of overall NHS expenditure data.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Calculating programme budgeting data is complex and not all healthcare activity or services can be classified directly to a programme budgeting category or care setting. When it is not possible to reasonably estimate a programme budgeting category, expenditure is classified as ‘Other’. Expenditure on General Medical Services and Personal Medical Services cannot be reasonably estimated at disease specific level, and is separately identified as a subcategory of ‘Other’ expenditure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The allocation of expenditure to programme budgeting subcategories is not always straightforward, and subcategory level data should therefore be used with caution.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- In order to improve data quality, continual refinements have been made to the programme budgeting data calculation methodology since the first collection in 2003-04. The underlying data which support programme budgeting data are also subject to yearly changes. Programme budgeting data cannot be used to analyse changes in investment in specific service areas between years. Users of the data should note that significant changes to the data calculation methodology were introduced in 2010-11.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Figures for years 2003-04 to 2009-10 are calculated using provider costs as a basis. Figures for 2010-11 to 2012-13 are calculated using price paid for specific activities and services purchased from healthcare providers. PCTs follow standard guidance, procedures and mappings when calculating programme budgeting data.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- PCT figures used to calculate 2010-11 data differ from those previously published in the 2010-11 programme budgeting benchmarking spreadsheet. This is due to the correction of errors identified for five PCTs for this year.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Aggregate PCT data supersede previously published England level programme budgeting data. England level data incorporated estimates of expenditure on healthcare conditions for the Department of Health, strategic health authorities and special health authorities. England level data is no longer published this data as aggregate PCT figures provide a more accurate and meaningful representation of the breakdown of NHS expenditure by healthcare condition.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- For 2003-04, figures are based on PCT net expenditure. For 2004-05 onwards, figures are based on PCT spend on own population.

Search and Rescue remains outside the competence of the EU or its Agencies, including Frontex.
