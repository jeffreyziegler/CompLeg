The Government is clear that a Northwest Runway at Heathrow will help to secure the UK’s status as a global aviation hub, while regional airports will continue to develop their point-to-point networks.</p><p> </p><p>This conclusion is supported by the analysis which shows that passenger numbers and international flights at airports outside of London are expected to increase by 80% and 71% respectively between 2016 and 2050 with a third runway at Heathrow. In addition, passengers from all across the UK are expected to use the connections made available at an expanded Heathrow, with nearly 6 million additional trips from passengers outside of London and the South East being made via the airport in 2040.</p><p> </p><p>Table 1 below shows the forecast number of international passenger Air Transport Movements (ATM) from the Department’s 2017 UK aviation forecasts.<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> The Government recognises that all three schemes for expansion in the South East are projected to result in regional airports experiencing somewhat slower growth in international flights than they might otherwise have seen. However, there is still expected to be strong growth at non-London airports relative to today. Expansion will also improve the UK’s connectivity as a whole with more frequent services to important destinations around the world, providing benefits for passengers and freight-operators across the UK, supporting economic growth.</p><p> </p><p>It is recognised that Table 1 does not reflect this hub benefit nor the considerably greater scope that expansion brings for more domestic flights from regional airports to Heathrow, which would provide passengers from across the country access to a vast network of international destinations.

The data may differ slightly from that of the published statistics as these data were run on a different date. Clearance times are dependent on several factors, such as hearing capacity at the venue closest to the appellant, or the local availability of tribunal panel members. Other factors might include the availability of the appellant or their representative, or the provision of further evidence. Additionally, a decision on the appeal may be reached after a hearing has been adjourned (which may be directed by the judge for a variety of reasons, such as to seek further evidence), or after a hearing has been postponed (again, for a variety of reasons, often at the request of the appellant). An appeal may also have been referred back to the First-tier Tribunal by the Upper Tribunal for disposal. Cases may also have been stayed at the First-tier Tribunal, pending a decision by the Upper Tribunal on a lead case. HMCTS has been working with the tribunal’s judiciary both to appoint additional judges and panel members and take forward initiatives with potential to increase the capacity and performance of the tribunal. These include reviewing current listing practices to increase the number of cases being listed on a tribunal session, and introducing case management “triage” sessions, with the aim of reducing the time taken for appeals to reach final determination. All these measures will increase the capacity of the tribunal with the aim of reducing waiting times for appellants.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p>","South East Cambridgeshire","Lucy Frazer",,"2018-06-11T14:44:40.967Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/918473/answer","Biography information for Lucy Frazer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/918473/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/918473/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-06-06","Social Security Benefits: Appeals","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what the average length of time was for the Tribunals Service to administer a First-tier Tribunal-Social Security and Child Support appeal for (a) personal independence payment, (b) employment and support allowance, (c) income support, (d) jobseeker's allowance and (e) tax credits, (f) universal credit in (i) Coventry, (ii) the West Midlands and (iii) England in the last period for which figures are available.","false","Biography information for Colleen Fletcher","Coventry North East","Colleen Fletcher","150699"

The UK also continues to provide support to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Organisation for Animal Health, challenging them and other United Nations agencies and international organisations to deliver an ambitious, robust and joined-up response which aligns with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Global Action Plan on AMR.</p><p> </p><p>The UK was instrumental in drafting and gaining support for a UN political declaration on AMR, which was agreed by 193 UN member states at the UN General Assembly in September 2016.

To ensure progress of the 2016 UN Resolution, the Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) on AMR was established, with the UK’s Chief Medical Officer, providing pivotal momentum as an expert member and co-convener in her independent capacity. The IACG is due to report to the UN Secretary General in summer 2019.</p><p> </p><p>Since the beginning of the current strategy in 2013, the UK Government has committed over £615 million in delivering domestic and international programmes to tackle AMR, including the Fleming Fund (£265 million) and the Global AMR Innovation Fund (£50 million).
