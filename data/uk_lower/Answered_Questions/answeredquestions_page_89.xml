The reason for this is two-fold, firstly because the NRM referral is not an immigration route by which individuals should regularise their stay in the United Kingdom and secondly, because a person’s status in immigration detention is not permanent and can change. The use of immigration detention in all cases is subject to regular reviews and consequently, a change in circumstance may result in a different consideration. It is quite possible that an immigration detainee is referred to the National Referral Mechanism during a detention period and is released into the community at any point during that process.</p><p>The decision to detain, or maintain detention of individuals that have been referred to the NRM is made in line with the Adults at Risk in Immigration Detention (AAR) policy. Consequently, the decision to release an individual because of vulnerabilities highlighted in an NRM referral, is also considered in line with this policy and is recorded as such on central records.</p><p>The Home Office does not currently centrally record any particular indicator of risk under the AAR policy. This is because the AAR policy is based on evidence levels rather than level of risk and there are currently no indica-tors of risk which are considered more significant than others. The Home Office therefore, currently, centrally record the relevant level of evidence under the policy, rather than the indicator(s) of risk.</p><p>In light of the above, we are therefore unable to directly report on the num-ber of NRM referrals for those who are detained for immigration purposes there have been and of those, who many were released from detention, or for whom their detention was maintained.</p>","Romsey and Southampton North","Caroline Nokes",,"2018-12-19T16:54:41.45Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1023263/answer","Biography information for Caroline Nokes","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1023263/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1023263/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2018-12-11","Immigrants: Detainees","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, how many referrals to the National Referral Mechanism for those who are detained for immigration purposes there have been; and how many of those referred were (a) released and (b) kept in detention.","false","Biography information for Tulip Siddiq","Hampstead and Kilburn","Tulip Siddiq","201248"

Following the publication of the Rough Sleeping Strategy in August, significant work has been underway across departments to deliver the commitments made. I was pleased to recently publish (attached) a delivery plan (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rough-sleeping-strategy-delivery-plan" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rough-sleeping-strategy-delivery-plan</a> ) setting out progress to date and key milestones in the coming months. In 2019 we will publish the first annual update to the strategy, building on our existing work and delivering new interventions where our evidence shows they are needed.</p><p>The Government is committed to reducing homelessness and rough sleeping. No one should ever have to sleep rough. That is why this summer we published the cross-government Rough Sleeping Strategy. This sets out an ambitious £100 million package to help people who sleep rough now but also puts in place the structures that will end rough sleeping once and for all. The Government has now committed over £1.2 billion to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over the spending review period.</p>",,"Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth",,"2018-12-19T13:04:31.987Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1022905/answer","Biography information for Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1022905/answer","181219 Rough Sleeping Autumn 2017 Statistical Release - HL12162.pdf ; 181219 RSS delivery plan HL12162.pdf","181219 Rough Sleeping Autumn 2017 Statistical Release - HL12162.pdf ; 181219 RSS delivery plan HL12162.pdf","Rough Sleeping figures ; Rough Sleeping delivery plan","Rough Sleeping figures ; Rough Sleeping delivery plan","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1022905/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2018-12-10","Sleeping Rough","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what are the latest figures for the number of rough sleepers in England; and what progress has been made on implementing their rough sleeping strategy announced on 13 August and its ambition to halve the number of those sleeping rough by 2022 and to end it altogether by 2027.","false","Biography information for The Marquess of Lothian",,"The Marquess of Lothian","HL12162"

For example a newly-sentenced category C prisoner will initially begin their sentence in a predominant function ‘local’ prison, which serves the courts and is built to a category B standard, before being allocated to a category C ‘training’ prison.</p><p> </p><p>The number of category C prisoners held in category B training prisons has fallen considerably in the last 8 years.

Decisions must reflect both the specific needs and circumstances of the prisoner, as well as the operating regime and range of services at the receiving prison. We consider factors such as length of sentence, security category and offending behaviour requirements. Closeness to home is one of the key factors considered when choosing where to place prisoners, particularly for those on short sentences or nearing release, where they need to (re)build family ties, secure housing and health services and look for work. These prisoners are prioritised for places in suitable prisons which are closer to home.</p><p> </p><p>Through the Government’s Prison Estate Transformation Programme we are getting the basics right by building decent prisons to improve rehabilitation and create safe and secure environments for staff and offenders. As well as constructing new prisons we are reconfiguring the existing estate so that prisoners will be held in the right place at the right time in their journey and their rehabilitation can be managed more effectively. By matching people in prison to the function that a prison fulfils, prisons will be able to deliver the right outcomes, and people in prison will be better supported to turn their lives around.</p>","Penrith and The Border","Rory Stewart",,"2018-12-18T17:12:26.767Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1022967/answer","Biography information for Rory Stewart","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1022967/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1022967/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-12-10","Prison Accommodation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prisoners categorised as suitable for Category C accommodation are housed in Category B training prisons.","false","Biography information for Richard Burgon","Leeds East","Richard Burgon","200702"

No decisions have been made about any future prison closures. Construction of the first two new build resettlement prisons at Wellingborough and then Glen Parva is expected to begin in late 2018 and late 2019, with completion planned for early 2021 and 2022 respectively. We continue to focus on safety and decency in the prison estate. Last July, the Justice Secretary announced an investment of £30 million in prisons to enhance safety, security and decency across the estate. This includes a £16m investment in improving the fabric of prisons, targeting those with the most pressing maintenance issues so that we can start bringing them back up to acceptable standards. As announced in the 2018 Budget, an additional £30 million will be spent on prisons this financial year on top of the £30 million announced in July. This will go towards further improvements to safety, security and decency on top of those already announced.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p>","Penrith and The Border","Rory Stewart","200144 ; 200145","2018-12-12T17:01:29.277Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1020795/answer","Biography information for Rory Stewart","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1020795/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1020795/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-12-07","Prisons","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, pursuant to the Written Statement of 29 November 2018 on Prisons Update, Official Report HCWS1123, when he plans to close the current unsuitable accommodation.","false","Biography information for Liz Saville Roberts","Dwyfor Meirionnydd","Liz Saville Roberts","200146"
