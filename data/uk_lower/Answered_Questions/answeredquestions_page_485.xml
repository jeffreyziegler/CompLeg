The Government has so far committed £70 <br>million of NCSP funding to build law enforcement capabilities to tackle cyber <br>crime. This includes the establishment of the National Cyber Crime Unit in the <br>National Crime Agency (NCA), and cyber teams within each of the Regional <br>Organised Crime Units across England and Wales. We are also developing the <br>capability and awareness of local police forces. The NCA has led efforts to <br>arrest and disrupt cyber criminals, including warning individuals who may have <br>access to malicious software that they are known to the agency and that any <br>movement into criminality will result in action. NCSP also funds the Action <br>Fraud, the national reporting service for fraud and financially motivated cyber <br>crime, and the National Fraud Intellligence Bureau. Both of these are run by <br>the City of London Police, the country’s national lead force for fraud <br>investigations. My Rt. Hon.

The Northern Ireland Executive can currently borrow up to £200m per year, up to a total of £3bn, from the UK’s National Loans Fund (NLF), through the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative (RRI).</p><p> </p><p>Any loans from the European Investment Bank which were additional to the NLF borrowing would, like the existing facility, count towards the UK’s overall Public Sector Net Cash Requirement (PSNCR) and would have the effect of increasing the overall level of public spending. For this reason, any Northern Ireland Executive borrowing needs to be within the £200m per year limits which are provided for within the devolved administration’s total budgets each year. Any increases in borrowing beyond the agreed limits must be offset by reductions in other spending to avoid adding to the overall limits on public spending set out by the Government. Such reductions could be enforced by cuts to the ‘block grant’ portion of NI budgets if the Northern Ireland Executive did not make other offsetting savings.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is important to recognise that bodies other than the Northern Ireland Executive can bid for EIB loans in Northern Ireland.

Since April 2011, councils have received over £2.2 billion for bringing empty homes back into residential occupation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>· Giving councils new powers to remove council tax subsidies to empty homes, and use the funds to keep the overall rate of council tax down. HM Treasury have also changed tax rules to discourage the use of corporate envelopes to invest in high value housing which may be left empty or under-used to avoid paying tax.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>· Cancelling the Labour Government’s Pathfinder programme which sought to demolish homes, instead of focusing on refurbishment and getting empty homes into use. We have taken forward the best practice guidance produced by our independent adviser, George Clarke, and embedded it in our housing programme funding schemes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>· Reforming Community Infrastructure Levy rules to provide an increased incentive for brownfield development, and extending exemptions for empty buildings being brought back into use. We have also been consulting on proposals to lift Section 106 burdens on vacant buildings being returned to use.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>· Introducing the Right to Contest, building on our existing Community Right to Reclaim Land, which lets communities ask that under-used or unused land owned by public bodies is brought back into beneficial use. This new right applies to sites currently in use, but are not vital for operations. It gives businesses and members of the public an opportunity to challenge government on the best use of its estate.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>· Reforming permitted development rights in a number of ways to free up the planning system and facilitate the conversion of redundant and under-used non-residential buildings into new homes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Bristol West","Stephen Williams","200781","2014-09-03T14:22:27.7998385Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77045/answer","Biography information for Stephen Williams","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77045/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77045/answer",,,,,,,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-07-10","Empty Property: Greater London","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what estimate the Department has made of the number of private sector vacancies in London.","false","Biography information for Dr Matthew Offord","Hendon","Dr Matthew Offord","205068"

Booked admissions are those in which the patient was admitted electively having been given a date at the time it was decided to admit. Planned admissions are excluded as they are usually part of a planned sequence of clinical care determined mainly on clinical criteria, which, for example, could require a series of events, perhaps taking place every three months, six months or annually.

This is just one example of how the NCA is working with partners in the UK, and internationally, to take the fight to organised criminals. <br><br>The Northern Ireland Justice Minister is leading in the efforts to extend the powers of the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland within an appropriate framework. As he said in answer to an Assembly question on 9 July, David Ford hopes to bring a revised proposed model for the operation of the NCA in Northern Ireland to all relevant parties as soon as practicable to seek to move matters forward. My officials have, naturally, had extensive discusssions with the Department of Justice and will continue to do so. <br><br>While these discussions are ongoing, the National Crime Agency remains committed to assisting the Police Service of Northern Ireland in tackling serious and organised crime as far as the restrictions on its powers permit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Staffordshire Moorlands","Karen Bradley",,"2014-07-21T15:51:52.5712984Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77170/answer","Biography information for Karen Bradley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77170/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77170/answer",,,,,,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-07-10","National Crime Agency","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what recent assessment she has made of the performance of the National Crime Agency; and what discussions officials in her Department have had with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive on extending the scope of that agency to operate in Northern Ireland.","false","Biography information for Nigel Dodds","Belfast North","Mr Nigel Dodds","205016"

There are varying levels of investment across the region, with a strong emphasis on the energy sector.</p><p>Figures from the Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SIEPA) show that Russia was the seventh largest foreign direct investor in Serbia in the period 2001-13. The majority of that investment is in the energy sector. In 2013 87 per cent of Serbia’s gas needs were supplied by Russia. Gazprom owns 56 per cent of the Serbian oil company Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS). It is investing a reported $2.1 billion in the building of South Stream. Other energy companies, such as LUKOIL, are active. There has also been Russian investment in the railway and banking sectors.</p><p>In the first nine months of 2013, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) attracted €95 million of Russian investment, which was 46 per cent of total foreign investment. To date the biggest Russian investment in BiH has been in the privatisation and modernisation of the petrol industry in Republika Srpska (RS) and the acquisition of Austria’s Volksbank by Sberbank. Other projects of Russian interest are: a coal mine and thermo-power station complex at Uglejevik; a branch pipeline connection to South Stream (into Serbia), which provides mains gas supply to 47 towns in Republika Srpska; and a hydro power plant at Dabar, with a proposal for two further small hydro plants.</p><p>Macedonian industry is dependent on Russian gas and Skopje expects to be included in the South Stream project.</p><p>The bilateral relationship between Albania and Russia is modest. Albania does not import oil or gas directly from Russia, although Russian companies are among those looking to invest in the renewal of the Albanian energy sector. Albanian exports to Russia are minimal – in 2012 they represented only 0.45 per cent of the country’s total exports.</p><p>Montenegro’s bilateral trade with Russia is also small. In 2012-13, 43 per cent of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) came from EU countries, with Russian FDI amounting to 14 per cent.
