The Department works closely with NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) to support delivery of the Mandate and system objectives.</p><p> </p><p>The PHE report, Deaths associated with neurological conditions in England 2001 to 2014, was developed by PHE’s Neurology Intelligence Network (NIN), and published on 27 February 2018. The report found that a greater proportion of epilepsy related deaths occur in areas of higher levels of deprivation. The rate of deaths associated with epilepsy in areas ranked as the most deprived in England is almost three times larger than in the least deprived; 13 deaths per 100,000 population compared to 5 deaths per 100,000 population. A copy of the report can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions</a></p><p> </p><p>Wider research has shown that epilepsy prevalence varies with social deprivation, but this is not well understood, and it is not clear whether this inequality in mortality is the consequence of the increased prevalence seen in deprived areas, of poor care, or both. However, deprivation is a well-known determinant of poor general health, and although there is insufficient evidence to describe the relationship as causal, it underlines the health inequalities link in relation to epilepsy related deaths.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is acting broadly to reduce health inequalities by addressing the social causes of ill health, promoting healthier lifestyles for all and tackling differences in outcomes of NHS services, all underpinned by legal duties. Through the Mandate the Government has asked NHS England to ensure service commissioning focuses on measurable reductions in inequalities in access to health services, in people’s experience of the health system, and across a specified range of health outcomes which contribute to reducing inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. National and local outcomes frameworks feature indicators to measure improvements across a range of areas, including inequalities, and the Mandate asks NHS England to do more in increasing the transparency on services and outcomes that these frameworks provide.</p><p> </p><p>At a national level, NHS England is the organisation responsible for securing and supporting high quality outcomes for people with epilepsy, and the vast majority of services for people with the condition are planned and commissioned by local clinical commissioning groups. Action is led locally to ensure the solutions put in place reflect the needs of individual communities.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England’s RightCare programme provides practical support to local commissioners to tackle unwarranted variation, including in services for neurological conditions like epilepsy. NHS England is also working with the Neurological Alliance to support the Neurology Advisory Group, led by Professor Adrian Williams, to align work across the system to improve neurological care. In addition to developing the neurology mortality report, PHE’s NIN provides a broad range of data on disease, services and outcomes, including for epilepsy, to support local commissioners to benchmark services and drive improvement. The neurology mortality report will provide further focus for commissioners in considering whether there are any changes they need to make in terms of service planning and provision, including around the inequality issues identified.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage","237060","2019-04-03T16:09:08.463Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105476/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105476/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105476/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-03-27","Epilepsy: Death","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what discussions he has had with (a) clinicians and (b) NHS leadership on the findings of Public Health England’s report into Deaths associated with neurological conditions in England 2001 to 2014; and what assessment he has made of the implications of those findings for his Department's work to prevent future deaths from epilepsy.","false","Biography information for Mr Edward Vaizey","Wantage","Mr Edward Vaizey","237654"

It shows many bee and hoverfly species have become less widespread since 1980, leading to an overall, long-term decline, although some species have become more prevalent. It also shows that this overall decline has slowed, but not ceased, since the 1990s; and that since 2011, overall trends appear to have stabilised, although a number of individual species continue to decline.</p><p> </p><p>The Government acknowledges these long-term range contractions for many species and the changes in distribution amongst different types of pollinators. In response to the overall reductions we developed a National Pollinator Strategy (NPS) for England, a 10-year plan published in 2014. A core commitment of the NPS is to strengthen the evidence base so that we can better meet pollinators’ needs. We will continue to work with CEH and other research partners, and to understand better the CEH paper’s analysis of trends in upland areas and in southern Britain, and their impact across the UK.</p><p> </p><p>As part of ongoing work to improve the evidence base, CEH coordinates the UK-wide Pollinator Monitoring Scheme, which is part-funded by Government. It is the only scheme in the world generating systematic data on the abundance of bees, hoverflies and other flower-visiting insects at a national level. Furthermore, in March 2019, Defra published up-to-date evidence statements on UK pollinators and pollination services, to which CEH and other leading institutions contributed.</p><p> </p><p>We know that pollinators add substantial economic value to crop production through improving crop quality and quantity. Pollination’s economic benefit to UK crop production is approximately half a billion GBP annually, through increased yields of oilseed rape, fruit and vegetables. These crops are especially vulnerable to pollinator declines. There is no clear evidence, however, that UK crop pollination is being impacted, although a study has identified sub-optimal pollination in gala apples for example.</p><p> </p><p>We are also working with researchers to understand better such potential risks of pollinator declines to food production and biodiversity, and to better inform land management approaches. For example, the University of Reading is leading a three-year Research Council-funded project on mapping and managing risks to pollinators across the UK, to help support sustainable and resilient crop production and maintain sufficient pollination services.</p><p> </p><p>The NPS also commits us to provide habitat for pollinators. Certainly, we have seen success when landowners, farmers, conservation groups and Government collaborate to create new habitats and support reintroductions of lost species such as the barberry carpet moth, short-haired bumblebee and chequered skipper butterfly. We will continue to work in partnership with scientists and with practitioners to build on such successes and to see many more of our wonderful, vital insects thrive.</p>",,"Lord Gardiner of Kimble",,"2019-04-09T15:23:45.213Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105692/answer","Biography information for Lord Gardiner of Kimble","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105692/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1105692/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-03-27","Pollinators","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the research conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in their report Widespread losses of pollinating insects in Britain, published on 26 March, in particular its finding that bee and hoverfly species have declined; and what assessment they have made of (1) the spread of losses of such species across the UK, and (2) the impact of such losses.","false","Biography information for Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer",,"Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer","HL14871"

Under current pollution control regulation, stores must be constructed to a required standard, meet necessary construction requirements and have a minimum capacity of 4 months’ storage.

The Plan commits to improving autism diagnostic pathways in England and ensuring autistic people have access to high-quality care and support in the community. Over the next three years, autism diagnosis will be included alongside work with children and young people’s mental health services to test and implement the most effective ways to reduce waiting times for specialist services. This will be a step towards achieving timely diagnostic assessments in line with best practice guidelines.</p><p> </p><p>The Department is determined to drive up performance on autism diagnosis nationally. To support this NHS Digital began formally collecting autism diagnosis waiting time data from mental health provider trusts for the first time through the Mental Health Services Data Set in April 2018. Data is submitted on behalf of autism diagnostic services, in line with issued guidance. The current plan is to publish a report after a year’s data has been collected and analysed, in September/October 2019. As this is the first time this data is being submitted, some work to improve its quality may be necessary.</p><p> </p><p>The data being collected covers both adults and children and includes:</p><p>- The length of time people with suspected autism wait following referral for a diagnosis before an assessment is started (to compare with the 13 week NICE Recommendation);</p><p>- The number of people within the reporting period receiving an autism diagnosis and the time it took to get the diagnosis;</p><p>- Profiled information (gender, age, other recorded diagnosis etc);</p><p>- The number of autistic people seen by mental health services within the reporting period; and</p><p>- Referrals to NHS services due to autism diagnosis or because autism diagnosis not confirmed, or where no further assessment or treatment was appropriate.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, the Department is developing guidance on autism and an accompanying toolkit to support local health and care commissioners with commissioning diagnostic and post-diagnosis services. The guidance will bring together existing guidelines, standards and best practice examples on how to commission effective, high quality services for autistic people. This will include setting out care pathways to support timely diagnosis of autism and effective post-diagnosis support services.

There are no plans to increase sentences for assault offences.</p><p> </p><p>When making sentencing decisions the courts must follow the relevant sentencing guidelines, produced by the independent Sentencing Council. The <em>Overarching principles: seriousness Guideline</em> and <em>Assault Guideline</em> include an aggravating factor where ‘an offence is committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public’. Where applied, this would merit an increased sentence within the maximum available. The Sentencing Council is reviewing its guidelines on assault and a consultation on a revised guideline is anticipated later this year.</p><p> </p><p>On 21 January the Home Office announced the launch of a call for evidence on violence and abuse towards shop workers. The aim of this work is to strengthen our understanding of the issue, including how existing legislation is being applied.
