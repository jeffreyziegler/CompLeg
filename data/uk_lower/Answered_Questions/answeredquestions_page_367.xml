A company or group which elects for the Tonnage Tax is required, each year, to recruit one new officer trainee for every fifteen officer posts in its fleet.

At present those providing such services remain significant employers of UK seafarers.</p><br /><p>UK seafarers working for UK companies on a UK flagged vessel are not entitled to an exemption to national insurance payments. They may, however, benefit from the Seafarers Earning Reductions tax relief for income tax.</p><br /><p>An ‘in personum’ approach to the application of national minimum wage is preferred as it ensures that those who are entitled to it will benefit.

Given the complexity of loneliness and the different ways that people are affected, there is no single solution. Many of the solutions to combatting loneliness lie within local communities and involve local authorities, community organisations, the voluntary sector and individuals, working together. Local authorities prioritise how they spend their funding for social care. In 2014-15 authorities spent around £80 million in tackling social isolation in England[1].</p><p> </p><p>Government has a part to play. It has prioritised prevention through the Care Act 2014.The Department has funded the Social Care Institute for Excellence to develop and run the Prevention Library which includes examples of emerging practice to prevent, reduce or delay people’s care and support needs from deteriorating. This includes examples of innovative projects to tackle loneliness. The Department has also supported a ‘digital toolkit’ for local commissioners, which was developed by the Campaign to End Loneliness and is incorporated in its guidance for commissioners.

A hunting trophy of an endangered species can only be exported if the exporting country is satisfied that the hunt was both legal and sustainable. CITES controls are implemented at an EU-wide level and the UK works with other EU Member States to agree a collective approach.</p><p> </p><p>In light of growing concerns about the sustainability of the hunting of some species, the EU has introduced stricter controls on the import of hunting trophies of six species, including lions and African elephants. These require that both the exporting and importing country must be satisfied that the animal was hunted sustainably. As a result the import of hunting trophies of certain species from certain countries is currently prohibited by the EU, including lion trophies from Cameroon and Mozambique and elephant trophies from Tanzania. Imports of lion and elephant trophies from Zimbabwe are currently allowed into the EU as they are considered to be sustainable. The import of lion trophies from Tanzania is under consideration by the Scientific Review Group, which brings together the Scientific Authorities of EU Member States to provide advice on CITES matters and which is expected to decide at its next meeting whether the importation of lion trophies from Tanzania should be prohibited.</p><p> </p><p>A full list of EU CITES trade suspensions can be found at: <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R0736" target="_blank">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R0736</a></p><p> </p><p>I recognise that there are real concerns about the impact of trophy hunting on lion conservation. As I announced in Parliament on 24 November 2015, the Government will ban lion trophy imports within the next two years unless there are improvements in the way hunting takes place in certain countries, judged against strict criteria.
