In some cases it seems owners are struggling to cope with the costs involved in keeping a horse. In other cases, irresponsible breeders and horse traders are deliberately placing horses on land to secure grazing for their animals at no cost to themselves. In the Government's view the way to address these problems is to tackle the perpetrators directly. Anti-social behaviour orders have been successfully used in Wales and in Bristol to address fly grazing, and there is likely to be an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 where a horse is abandoned. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 brings forward new streamlined measures to tackle anti-social behaviour, of which the practice of fly-grazing of horses is a prime example. Where fly grazing is a particular problem, we encourage the local authorities and police to work together with landowners, farmers and welfare charities to identify the culprits and address their behaviour directly using these powers. In a number of cases and to encourage joined up working, protocols have been drawn up by some local authorities to summarise the action that can be taken under existing legislation. Defra is supplementing that guidance with advice on the new measures in the 2014 Act which come into force later this year.</p><p> </p>","Camborne and Redruth","George Eustice",,"2014-06-26T10:25:31.7984735Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63235/answer","Biography information for George Eustice","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63235/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63235/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2014-06-23","Horses: Animal Welfare","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his Department plans to take to address the problem of horse abandonment.","false","Biography information for Naomi Long","Belfast East","Naomi Long","201775"

There is some evidence that a number of the mediation services which have closed following legal aid reforms were vulnerable to closure before the reforms took effect.</p><p> </p><p>I have convened a Family Mediation Task Force, chaired by David Norgrove, which has considered many of the issues raised by the Member of Parliament for Exeter, including how to reverse the fall in referrals and engage the second party in the mediation process, and incentivising mediators and lawyers to work in partnership to support clients through the resolution of their dispute in compliance with the new legislation. A number of short-term financial options have been considered as well as the long term view for the future of dispute resolution services.</p><p> </p><p>The Taskforce report will be published imminently.

This is in part due to fewer people visiting solicitors who previously would have directed clients to mediation.</p><p> </p><p>Before April 2013, attendance at a Mediation Information Assessment Meeting (MIAM) was a pre-requisite for legal representation for people eligible to obtain public funding. We introduced a statutory MIAM in April 2014 as part of the Children and Families Act. This placed a legal obligation on an applicant to attend a MIAM for the purpose of considering mediation, before being permitted to issue court proceedings in certain private family law matters (children and financial disputes).</p><p> </p><p>Legal aid remains available for mediation (and for legal help with mediation) for those who meet the eligibility criteria. We are keen to encourage mediation as an alternative to court both for those eligible for public funding and for privately funded cases.</p><p> </p><p>We are aware that a small number of mediation services have closed or are in difficulty. The Legal Aid Agency (LAA) is constantly monitoring the situation to make sure there is sufficient provision for client access to mediation services. While a decline in demand is a contributory factor in mediation service closures, another significant factor is poor and unsustainable business models. There is some evidence that a number of the mediation services which have closed following legal aid reforms were vulnerable to closure before the reforms took effect.</p><p> </p><p>I have convened a Family Mediation Task Force, chaired by David Norgrove, which has considered many of the issues raised by the Member of Parliament for Exeter, including how to reverse the fall in referrals and engage the second party in the mediation process, and incentivising mediators and lawyers to work in partnership to support clients through the resolution of their dispute in compliance with the new legislation. A number of short-term financial options have been considered as well as the long term view for the future of dispute resolution services.</p><p> </p><p>The Taskforce report will be published imminently.

The study concluded that with the right safeguards in place the net effect on GHG emissions from shale gas production in the UK will be relatively small. Indeed emissions from the production and transport of UK shale gas are likely to be lower than imported Liquefied Natural Gas and gas piped from outside Europe, which shale gas is expected to replace.</p><p>DECC's Gas Generation Strategy (2012) and Heat Strategy (2013) both set out the important role gas has to play to maintain adequate capacity margins, meet demand and provide supply-side flexibility whilst keeping emissions within the limits set out in the Carbon Budgets to 2030 and beyond. We need further drilling and testing to establish how much shale gas will be recoverable, but it is likely that domestically produced shale gas would contribute to the overall natural gas mix that is used for both heat and electricity generation, replacing some imported and slightly higher carbon liquefied natural gas.</p>","Sevenoaks","Michael Fallon",,"2014-06-26T15:14:13.6249527Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63057/answer","Biography information for Sir Michael Fallon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63057/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/63057/answer",,,,,"63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2014-06-20","Fracking","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, what assessment he has made of (a) the extent to which the future use of shale gas could reduce carbon emissions and (b) how this could contribute to the Government's target for an 80 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.","false","Biography information for Mr Stephen O'Brien","Eddisbury","Mr Stephen O'Brien","201622"

The report estimated that, in 2013, support costs for renewables added around 10% to electricity bills for energy intensive user (8% in relation to the renewables obligation (RO) and 2% in relation to the small-scale feed-in tariffs (FIT)).</p><p>Increased deployment of low-carbon generation, including renewables, which typically have low generating (and therefore operating) costs, helps to put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. It is not possible to split out the impact of renewable support policies on these wholesale price effects from other drivers such as, for example, the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS). However, the March 2013 report estimated that the overall wholesale price impact of all low-carbon policies was a reduction in the wholesale price faced by industry of around 30p/MWh in 2013.</p><p>The Government recognises the particular competitiveness issues faced by some industries in terms of their energy costs and has acted to mitigate the impact of energy policies on those industries. This includes the announcement, as part of the 2014 budget that the Government intends to compensate those energy-intensive industries most at risk of higher electricity prices resulting from the RO and the FIT schemes.

If they have not, the CQC may take enforcement action. Between 1 October 2012 and 30 September 2013, the CQC found 48 services did not comply with Regulation 17, leading to enforcement action. This enforcement action is set out in the following table.</p><p> </p><p>Enforcement action around Regulation 17 in 2012-13</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Acute hospitals</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mental health hospitals/hospitals for</p><p>people with a learning disability</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>General practitioners</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dentists</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Care homes</p></td><td><p>36</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Home care agencies</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Other social care services</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total</p></td><td><p>48</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>The CQC's consultation <em>‘A New Start'</em>, in June 2013 on how it regulates, inspects and rates services included a section on how Human Rights would be protected by changes to its regulatory model. To accompany the consultation, the CQC produced a draft document entitled, ‘Equality and Human Rights Duties Impact Analysis (decision making and policies)', to give more detail about the impact of the proposed changes on equality and human rights and how they would promote equality and human rights for people who use health and social care services.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC also consulted on its approach to human rights as part of a broader consultation on changes to regulation of care services. The CQC explained its proposed strategy for delivering on its commitment to promote equality, diversity and human rights in its regulatory work; to provide detail about what the strategy will mean in practice; and to receive feedback from important stakeholders.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC held the consultation between 9 April 2014 and 4 June 2014. The CQC will respond to the results of the consultation in September 2014.</p><p> </p><p>The consultation can be found at the following web link:</p><p> </p><p>www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20140406_our_human_rights_approach_public_consultation_final.pdf</p><p> </p><p>In January 2014 the CQC published ‘Equality Counts', a report providing information about equality in its workforce and for people who are affected by its regulatory policies and practices. The CQC will use the information in this report to drive its work in promoting equality and human rights, both in its regulatory functions and as an employer. The CQC will continue to develop its new approach to ensure equality in different types of health and social care services.</p>",,"Earl Howe",,"2014-06-30T12:47:35.684448Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/62818/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/62818/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/62818/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-06-19","Social Services: Human Rights","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government when they will make available to Parliament their assessment of the impact of the stronger regulatory powers available to the Care Quality Commission since 2008 on the provision of more human-rights compatible care to all service users, including the evidence on which that assessment is based, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report Legislative Scrutiny: Care Bill (11th Report, Session 2013–14, HL Paper 121).","false","Biography information for Lord Low of Dalston",,"Lord Low of Dalston","HL498"
