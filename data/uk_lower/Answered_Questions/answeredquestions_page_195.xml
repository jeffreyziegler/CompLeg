A large-scale survey, published in March 2017, of over 13,000 families who gained an EHC plan in 2015 found that two thirds were satisfied with the overall experience of getting a plan, and three-fifths agreed the help and support set out in the plan will achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p> </p><p>Where there are delays with any aspect of the EHC process, including issuing an EHC plan and delivering the provision set out in it, the local council should work with the family, explain the reason for the delay and address the situation swiftly. We know that sometimes issues cannot be immediately resolved and we have made available to families, in every local council, mediation services, as well as support from Independent Supporters and Information Advice and Support Services. Where issues regarding the EHC plan cannot be resolved, families can also appeal to the SEND Tribunal.</p>","Scarborough and Whitby","Mr Robert Goodwill","119398","2017-12-18T16:53:31.25Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/806208/answer","Biography information for Mr Robert Goodwill","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/806208/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/806208/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2017-12-13","Special Educational Needs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking to support families who have experienced delays in receiving appropriate support through education, health and care plans.","false","Biography information for Dr Rosena Allin-Khan","Tooting","Dr Rosena Allin-Khan","119400"

For example, in South Norfolk, a social prescription intervention project will tackle social isolation, reduce use of primary care resources, and help increase access to services in a rural area, and, in Stoke-on-Trent, funding is being used to help communities support older residents, particularly those who are experiencing social isolation and loneliness.</p><p>The planning system also encourages local authorities to consider loneliness and social isolation when making decisions. Paragraph 1.16 of the Housing White Paper confirmed the strengthening of the National Planning Policy Framework so that planning authorities are expected to have clear policies for addressing the housing requirements of groups with particular needs, such as elderly and disabled people and the Neighbourhood Planning Bill introduced a new statutory duty on the Secretary of State to produce guidance for local planning authorities on how their local development documents should meet the housing needs of older and disabled people. Guidance produced will place clearer expectations about planning to meet the needs of older people, including supporting the development of such homes near local services.</p><p>Additionally, our Supported Housing and Disabled Facilities Grant programmes are helping the target populations live as independently as possible within the community, which helps to prevent loneliness.</p><p>All community spaces have an important role to play in preventing loneliness and the Department works closely with local authorities, community groups, and the voluntary and charity sectors to ensure communities know and use the rights they have over their community assets. That can be the local pub, park, community café or local employment services, youth clubs, or social prescribing initiatives. The Pocket Parks Programme, for example, transformed 87 small patches of waste land across England (2015/2016) into community green spaces. Communities not only got a pocket park, but also came together in the planning, execution, and enjoyment of their new community hub, which helped to increase community cohesion and decrease social isolation.</p><p>In 2013-14, the Department of Health also added a loneliness measure to the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework and Public Health Outcomes Framework and supported the development of a loneliness toolkit for Health and Wellbeing Boards by the Campaign to End Loneliness, which can be found at http://campaigntoendloneliness.org/guidance/.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/804779","Department of Health","false","2017-12-20","<p>NHS Resolution’s provision for clinical negligence claims at 31 March 2017 was £64.7 billion. Recent rises in the provision are due to a number of factors including increases in the number of claims received, the amount of damages awarded, particularly in maternity claims and legal costs. This is also influenced by two discount rates:</p><p> </p><p>- The long term Public Expenditure System, set by HM Treasury, enabling a present value to be placed on future liabilities for accounting purposes but not affecting the costs of settling claims, changed from +2.2% to -0.8% from 31 March 2016, and increased the provision by £25.5 billion in 2015/16.</p><p> </p><p>- The personal injury discount rate (PIDR), set by the Lord Chancellor, places current value on future losses for settlement through lump sum payments, affecting the cost of settling claims. PIDR changed from +2.5% to -0.75% from 20 March 2017 and contributed £4.7 billion to the increase in the provision in 2016/17.</p><p> </p><p>The Government published draft legislation in September to reform the legal framework governing how the PIDR is set. The proposals will help ensure that claimants continue to receive full compensation but should significantly reduce overpayment by more reliably reflecting how awards are invested. Subject to its consideration of the Justice Select Committee’s pre-legislative scrutiny report and comments received from stakeholders on the draft legislation, the Government plans to introduce legislation to reform the law as soon as possible.</p><p> </p><p>The provision is calculated annually taking into account latest developments in the claims environment to inform assumptions about claims volumes, inflation in settlements and legal costs and time to settle claims. It is, therefore, not possible to provide an accurate provision for the next three years although it will continue to increase for some years to come for inflationary and other reasons.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>NHS Resolution manages the costs of claims appropriately, challenging claims without merit, excessive claims for damages and claimant legal costs. It works with trusts to help them understand their claims data to better assess where local interventions would have the greatest impact in reducing high volume or high cost claims, and shares learning and best practice from its analysis of claims. Its new strategy, <em>Delivering fair resolution and learning from harm: Our strategy to 2022</em> gives it an enhanced focus on mediation, learning and prevention, as well as litigation, and it will deliver increased insight into what drives the costs of harm and work with others to develop interventions that improve safety and save money for the NHS, as demonstrated by its recent report <em>Five years of cerebral palsy claims: A thematic review of NHS Resolution data</em>. A copy of both documents is attached.</p><p> </p><p>Following recent reports by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee on clinical negligence costs, the Department is working with the Ministry of Justice, HM Treasury and NHS Resolution and others to develop a cross government strategy to reduce them. This work is supported by our pursuit of improved safety standards and a transparent, learning culture across the NHS.</p>",,"Lord O'Shaughnessy",,"2017-12-20T13:20:14.837Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/804779/answer","Biography information for Lord O'Shaughnessy","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/804779/answer","Five-years-of-cerebral-palsy-claims_A-thematic-review-of-NHS-Resolution-data.pdf ; NHS-Resolution-Our-strategy-to-2022-1.pdf","Five-years-of-cerebral-palsy-claims_A-thematic-review-of-NHS-Resolution-data.pdf ; NHS-Resolution-Our-strategy-to-2022-1.pdf","Five years of cerebral palsy claims ; Delivering fair resolution and learning from harm","Five years of cerebral palsy claims ; Delivering fair resolution and learning from harm","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/804779/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-12-12","NHS: Negligence","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of recent rises in NHS Resolution's provision against claims for clinical negligence; what provision against claims for clinical negligence will be needed in each of the next three financial years; and what action they are taking to reduce the level of such provision.","false","Biography information for Lord Sharkey",,"Lord Sharkey","HL4107"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/804789","Department for Education","false","2017-12-27","<p>The government welcomed the recent ‘Autism and education in England 2017’ report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism (APPGA), which recommended the creation of a national strategy for autism. We will consider the recommendations of the report carefully, alongside those of other recent reports such as the attached ‘Lenehan Review’ of residential special schools. These reports will inform our plans for supporting children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). Officials are meeting representatives from the National Autistic Society in January 2018 to discuss the APPGA’s report.</p><p> </p><p>Local councils have a statutory duty, under the Children and Families Act 2014, to identify needs in their local area and to commission, together with partner agencies, services to support children and young people with SEND and their families. This includes services for children and young people with autism. These services must be included in each council’s ‘local offer’ of available services, which must be reviewed regularly, in consultation with local families, taking their views into consideration.</p><p> </p><p>The department has funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2012 to deliver autism training to early years, schools and post-16 education professionals in England. The AET has now trained more than 150,000 education staff. This includes head teachers, teachers and teaching assistants, as well as support staff such as receptionists and dining hall staff, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting children and young people with autism. The department will shortly begin discussions with the AET to consider an extension to their current contract.</p><p> </p><p>The department published a new framework for Initial Teacher Training (ITT) content in July 2016. The framework, attached, includes specific content on SEND, including autism, and is available for training providers to use. This twin approach of ongoing work in schools to increase awareness of autism through training, while also ensuring that new teachers are equipped to support pupils with autism from the outset, is designed to ensure that children and young people can succeed in their education. The department does not hold data on the numbers of teachers who have been trained by the AET or who have been through ITT courses that reflect the new ITT framework.</p><p>All academies and local authority maintained schools in England are expected to admit children and young people with SEND, including those with autism, whether or not they have an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. They cannot refuse to admit a pupil simply because he or she has a SEND. In 2016, there were 630 maintained special schools and 32 non-maintained special schools in England approved to make provision for pupils with autistic spectrum disorder. In addition, under the department’s free schools programme, there are now 29 special free schools open in England, including 17 which cater specifically for children with autism. These include the Rise Free School in Hounslow and the Lighthouse Free School in Leeds. A further 22 special free schools are due to open in future, 12 of which will specialise in provision for children with autism, including the Cumbria Academy for Autism and a second National Autistic Society free school, the Vanguard School in Lambeth.

Following a series of locally led Area Reviews, significant recommendations have been made that will deliver a more efficient post-16 system.</p><p> </p><p>Our focus is on further improving the quality of the education provided through a risk-based Ofsted inspection programme, a robust intervention framework where failing colleges are referred to the Further Education (FE) Commissioner, who will also have an extended role by working to support improvement. We have introduced a new Strategic College Improvement Fund, worth £15 million over two years, to enable weaker colleges to access support from their stronger peers and a National Leaders Programme for FE, to help drive improvement across the sector. These initiatives should help us to achieve our ambition of a further education sector comprised of high status institutions, which can confer the same advantages as academic institutions.</p><p> </p><p>Having the best-quality teachers and leaders is also key to delivering high-quality provision across FE. We have invested £40 million in the FE workforce since 2013. This has provided bursaries to support over 1,200 graduates to train to teach maths or English in the FE sector.
