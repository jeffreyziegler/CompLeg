Our target is to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste throughout the life of the 25 Year Environment Plan, but for the most problematic plastics we are going faster - that is why we have committed to work towards all plastic packaging placed on the UK market being recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.</p><p>The Government recently consulted on reforms to the packaging producer responsibility system to ensure that packaging producers fund the full net cost of managing the packaging they place on the market once it becomes waste. This provides a strong financial incentive for packaging producers to make better, more sustainable decisions at the design stage and during manufacture, and to take greater responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products.</p><p>Furthermore, in April last year, the Waste and Resources Action Programme and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation launched their world leading UK Plastics Pact, with support from the Government, and all the major supermarkets have signed up to it. The Pact brings these organisations together with four key targets for 2025 that aim to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated.

We will provide additional details of the planned introduction of the Future Homes Standard within the 2019 consultation on the energy efficiency standards of the Building Regulations.</li><li>We have committed to introduce a new scheme to help small businesses to improve the way they use energy and help them save money on their bills and reduce carbon emissions.</li><li>In response to a recommendation from the Green Finance Taskforce, we are working with partners to determine the steps necessary for landlords and businesses to understand and, potentially disclose operational energy use.

It came into force in April 2018 and transforms the culture of homelessness service delivery. For the first time, local authorities, public services, and the third sector will work together to actively prevent homelessness for people at risk, irrespective of whether they are a family or single person, what has put them at risk, or if they have a local connection to the area.</p><p>Although our data is still experimental the indications are that people who do not have priority need are being assisted by local authorities to prevent or relieve their homelessness. During the first 3 quarters for which we have published data 189,760 households have had a duty to prevent or relieve homelessness accepted, and only 6,020 households have been issued with a 'non priority homeless' decision. Our data indicates that less than 10 per cent of all applicants are homeless due to Domestic Abuse, and local authorities will be more inclined to provide accommodation to victims of abuse than others where there are competing demands for accommodation that is available to single people. People who are found to have no priority need are still entitled to assistance to relieve their homelessness.</p><p>The Homelessness Reduction Act is still very new and we expect outcomes to improve as the new duties are better understood.

We welcome and encourage initiatives to promote take up of Pension Credit by local organisations who may often be best placed to understand the local circumstances and needs in the community.</p><p>On a national basis, the DWP targets activity on engaging with people who may be eligible to benefits at pivotal stages, such as when they claim State Pension or report a change in their circumstances. The DWP uses a wide range of channels to communicate information about benefits to potential customers; including information on <a href="https://gov.uk/" target="_blank">https://gov.uk/</a>, in leaflets and by telephone. DWP staff in Pension Centres and Jobcentres including visiting officers are able to provide help and advice about entitlement to benefits, as are staff in Local Authorities who administer Housing Benefit.</p><p>Potential customers can use the Pension Credit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit-calculator" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit-calculator</a> to check if they are likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive. People wishing to claim Pension Credit can do so by calling 0800 99 1234.</p><p>One of the best ways to reach eligible customers is through trusted stakeholder working in the community and we have developed the Pension Credit toolkit, as an on-line tool for agencies and welfare rights organisations to use in order to encourage Pension Credit take-up. It can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pension-credit-toolkit" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pension-credit-toolkit</a></p><p>The toolkit contains resources for anyone working with pensioners and includes guides to Pension Credit. It also contains publicity material and guidance designed to help older people understand how they could get Pension Credit and help organisations support someone applying for Pension Credit as well as ideas for encouraging take-up. The toolkit also provides links to information about disability and carers benefits.</p><p>Most recently we have provided to relevant stakeholders a fact sheet about Pension Credit and the changes introduced on 15 May for mixed age couples to ensure that accurate information is available in the places where people are most likely to seek information.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport and the Ministry of Justice have now engaged the Law Commission on a second phase of their review of abusive and offensive online communications. The Law Commission will review existing communications offences and make recommendations about options for reform. This will include considering whether co-ordinated harassment by groups of people online could be more effectively dealt with by the criminal law. The Law Commission will also look at criminal law around non-consensual taking and sharing of intimate images, considering existing offences and identifying whether there are any gaps in the protection already offered to victims.
