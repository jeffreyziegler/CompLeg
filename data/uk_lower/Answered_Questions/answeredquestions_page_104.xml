The occupation and political situation can increase women’s vulnerability to social and economic insecurity and violence; this is heightened in Gaza where the situation remains dire. Female unemployment across the OPTs stood at around 40% in 2017, whereas for males it was 24%. The last available survey from 2010/11 shows that 37% (around 30% in the West Bank and over 51% in Gaza) of ever-married women suffered from a form of violence within the household. UN Women and other UN agencies support the Palestinian Authority in the implementation of gender-sensitive plans and policy-level initiatives to ensure the protection of women’s rights.</p><p> </p><p>The UK is a long-term supporter of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) which works to ensure gender equality and the protection of Palestine refugees’ rights in all its programming. UNRWA supports around 1 million Palestinian refugee women across the OPTs and protects their rights to health, water and sanitation, shelter and food security. UNRWA ensures an inclusive approach to protecting children’s right to an education (covering 160,000 girls in the West Bank and Gaza), provides antenatal and postnatal care for more than 50,000 women, and works to protect women and children from violence through access to services and community engagement.</p><p> </p><p>The UK is also working to protect women’s economic rights across the OPTs. Our Palestinian Market Development Programme supported a total of 219 female-owned managed enterprises from 2013 to 2018 and helped to create over 800 jobs for women.

Furthermore, when expenditure is presented on a “per head of population”(or “per capita”) basis, it does not account for the pressure that large numbers of commuters and visitors from outside a region can add to the transport networks.

The collection of the data protection charge (and previously the notification fee) is the responsibility of the ICO. The Data Protection Act 2018 sets out powers for the ICO to enforce collection of these charges, including penalties up to a maximum of 150% of the highest charge payable by a controller in that year (Part 5 section 158). The ICO is at liberty to use all funding generated by these charges for data protection activity.</p><p> </p><p>As a body funded by public money, the ICO is subject to standard Cabinet Office Spend Controls and HMT’s Managing Public Money principles. Full details on the controls pertaining to the ICO’s expenditure are available in the Management Agreement between the ICO and DCMS.</p><p> </p><p>Under the terms of this Management Agreement, the ICO is able to retain such funds as are necessary to meet any liabilities at the end of the financial year (such as creditors), or unspent funds up to a maximum of 3% of total annual data protection charge income (whichever is the greater). Any additional surplus would be remitted to the Consolidated Fund at the end of the financial year. This is the only scenario in which income from data protection charges would be remitted to the Consolidated Fund. As such, the data protection charge (previously notification fee) is not collected for the benefit of the Consolidated Fund, but rather to ensure the ICO is able to fulfil its important regulatory functions.</p><p> </p><p>Information on the amount of surplus remitted to the Consolidated Fund is not available for 2008/09 or 2009/10. For 2010/11 and 2011/12, this information is published on page 50 of the 2011/12 Annual Accounts. From 2012/13 onwards, this information is available in note 5b of the ICO’s Annual Accounts for each year.

I look forward to meeting Inquest soon to discuss the recommendations in their report. Our published statistics show that the 93 deaths from 2007 to 2017 to which the report refers include 41 from natural causes, 39 that were apparently self-inflicted and 13 other deaths, including 6 that have yet to be classified. The Government takes very seriously its responsibility to keep staff and prisoners safe, and we are committed to reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in our prisons. This is why we have established a prison safety programme through which we are taking forward a comprehensive set of actions to improve safety in custody. This includes a workstream on women offenders, which has drawn on helpful reports from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and the Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody to identify and take forward focused work in women’s prisons. These are in addition to the measures that we are taking across the estate, which include rolling out revised and improved training for staff in assessing and managing the risk of suicide and self-harm amongst prisoners (which has already reached more than 17,000 staff); improving support for prisoners in their early days in custody; revising the ACCT case management process for those identified as being at risk; and renewing our partnership with the Samaritans by confirming a further three years' grant funding for their valuable Listeners Scheme. On 27 June we published our strategy for female offenders, which sets out our vision and plan to improve outcomes for women both in the community and in custody. We want to see:<ul><li>fewer women coming into the criminal justice system;</li><li>fewer women in custody, especially on short-term sentences, and a greater proportion of women successfully managed in the community; and</li><li>better conditions for those in custody.</li></ul>A key theme in the strategy is the need for a joined-up approach to addressing female offenders’ often complex needs. We know that we will make progress in meeting these needs only by adopting a partnership approach at both national and local level. We hope to publish our National Concordat on Female Offenders by the end of the year. This will be a cross-governmental statement of intent and commitment to improve the outcomes for female offenders in a holistic, whole-systems approach.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","Charnwood","Edward Argar",,"2018-10-31T17:18:22.88Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/995609/answer","Biography information for Edward Argar","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/995609/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/995609/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-10-26","Prisoners: Females","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, if he will make an assessment of the implications for his Department’s policies of the findings of a report by Inquest entitled Still Dying on the inside: examining deaths in women's prisons, published in May 2018, that 93 women have died in custody in England and Wales since March 2007;  and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Luciana Berger","Liverpool, Wavertree","Luciana Berger","184397"
