"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/451515","Department for Education","false","2016-02-18","<p>We have not received specific representations on literacy and numeracy following the Secretary of State’s announcement in November. The government remains committed to raising standards of literacy and numeracy and works closely with professionals to raise standards for all pupils so that they are equipped to succeed in education and in life. In 2010, one in every three children starting secondary school was unable to read, write, or add up properly. Following government reforms, teachers have driven up standards with the figure now at one in five.</p><p>It is vital that we get the foundation right so that every child has a fair chance to succeed through all key stages. That is why we have placed phonics at the heart of the early teaching of reading and introduced a phonics check at the end of year 1 to enable schools to assess whether the essential building blocks of reading are in place. The percentage of pupils meeting the required standards of phonics in year 1 has increased from 58 percent in 2012 to 77 percent in 2015, putting 120,000 more 6 year olds each year on track to become confident readers. We fund a programme of 200 book clubs in primary schools where reading attainment at key stage 2 is currently low, and support schools to enrol year 3 pupils with a public library.</p><p>Beyond this, we have placed a greater emphasis within the primary curriculum and assessment on a secure grasp of the essentials such as grammar, punctuation and spelling, introducing a grammar, punctuation and spelling test in year 6.</p><p>For mathematics, we have placed particular emphasis in the primary curriculum on fluency in mental and written calculation. Just as knowledge of phonics is an essential foundation for success in reading, sound knowledge of arithmetic is essential for future success in mathematics. We removed the use of calculators for the end of key stage 2 mathematics tests from 2014 and in January 2016 we announced that all children will have their multiplication skills checked at the age of 11.</p><p>We want to ensure that all children have the right foundation at primary school and that any child who falls behind can catch up quickly. We provide funding to secondary schools to help year 7 pupils catch up and, as the Secretary of State said in her November speech, we have announced a resit test for year 7 pupils who do not meet expected standards in reading or mathematics at the end primary school.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2016-02-18T16:21:00.623Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/451515/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/451515/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/451515/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-02-09","Basic Skills: Primary Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to her announcement of 2 November 2015 Introducing greater emphasis on literacy and numeracy at key stage 2, what representations she has since received on that policy; and approximately how many such representations were (a) against and (b) in favour of that statement.","false","Biography information for Mrs Sheryll Murray","South East Cornwall","Mrs Sheryll Murray","26643"

As announced by the Prime Minister, my right hon. friend the Member for Witney (Mr Cameron) at the UN General Assembly in September, the UK will bolster support to the SNA and AMISOM through a deployment of up to 70 UK troops to the UN Support Office in Somalia.

Commitments made at the Conference will help to create 1.1 million jobs and provide education to an additional 1 million children. The protection of civilians was at the heart of the Conference. Participants agreed to use their influence with all parties to the conflict to halt abuses, to allow humanitarian agencies rapid, safe and unimpeded access throughout Syria in order to reach besieged and hard-to-reach areas.

We are deeply concerned by reports that over 30,000 civilians have been newly displaced from Aleppo City and other areas of northern Syria between 1<sup>st</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> February. This is on top of the existing 36,000 internally displaced persons from Aleppo City.</p><p>DFID continues to use existing funding to support our partners to be flexible in their responses and to enable the realignment of programming to meet those newly displaced and most in need. We also support the UN OCHA managed, Humanitarian Pooled Fund (HPF), which has announced a US$10.5 million emergency fund to meet the needs of the new displaced as a result of the fighting in northern Aleppo.
