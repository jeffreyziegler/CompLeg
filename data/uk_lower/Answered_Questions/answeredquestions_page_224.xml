In its recent Manufacturing &amp; Materials competition, Innovate UK has funded 4 projects, all lead by SMEs in the area of Digital Manufacturing, for a total of £2.25m. In addition, Innovate UK has just approved £180k to fund an extension of the Knowledge Transfer Network’s 4Manufacturing initiative until the end of March 2018, to enable manufacturing SMEs and their supply chains become more productive through the adoption of innovative Industry 4.0 technology.</p><p>The Challenger Business Programme identifies the barriers to the growth of innovative businesses across the economy; and works collaboratively with businesses, regulators and other partners to remove these. The Programme has already worked directly with over 400 businesses and going forwards we will work with many more.</p><p>We have asked Juergen Maier, as part of the Industrial Strategy, to conduct a review to conduct a review of Industrial Digitalisation with a strong focus on how UK SMEs can realise the benefits of Industry4.0 technologies.

All members of the Implementation Board participate on a voluntary basis with no remuneration and are required to declare any conflicts of interest. Where conflicts are identified members are excluded from any decision making process in which they would have an actual or perceived conflict. Ministers have not met with the Implementation Board since December 2016, but Departmental officials are present at meetings as observers.</p><p>The approach taken by the Board has been to encourage constructive stakeholder participation and engage across the sector. A broad range of stakeholders have been involved, including members representative of GasSafe installers.</p><p>One of the main recommendations from the Review was to establish a quality mark for retrofit energy efficiency and renewable energy measures, and for companies operating in this sector.</p><p>It is for industry to propose how the new quality mark framework will be structured and financed. As indicated in the Review it is intended that action build on good practice so reducing bureaucracy and potential duplication and reducing cost for industry and consumers overall.</p><p>The Each Home Counts review recognised that there is already good practice in the sector and many organisations operate to high standards. Where the quality mark requirements are already being met, companies will be able to apply to operate under the quality mark without further improvements. There is no intention from Government to make participation in the proposed Each Home Counts quality mark mandatory for any business or sector. As there is no regulatory requirement, Government does not plan to conduct a dedicated economic impact assessment for Each Home Counts.</p><p> </p>","Devizes","Claire Perry","106662 ; 106663 ; 106664 ; 106665 ; 106666 ; 106668 ; 106669 ; 106670","2017-10-19T16:32:03.67Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/767751/answer","Biography information for Claire Perry","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/767751/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/767751/answer",,,,,"201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2017-10-09","Natural Gas: Housing","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, whether he is taking to steps to ensure that gas-safe registered installers are not required to undertake additional work as a result of the Each Home Counts review.","false","Biography information for Sir Alan Campbell","Tynemouth","Mr Alan Campbell","106667"

Even when a court considers an offence to be so serious that custody is merited, it is required to consider whether community sentence would be better in that particular case, for example, for the purposes of rehabilitation. The law also requires that when the court has decided to impose a custodial sentence, it should be for the shortest time possible commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.</p>","Esher and Walton","Dominic Raab",,"2017-11-16T17:03:43.553Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/765348/answer","Biography information for Dominic Raab","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/765348/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/765348/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-10-06","Prison Sentences: Scotland","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment his Department has made of the Scottish Government's plans to restrict sentences of less than 12 months on (a) overcrowding, (b) safety and (c) reoffending.","false","Biography information for Imran Hussain","Bradford East","Imran Hussain","105578"

Leeds City Council has been funded through the Innovation Programme to embed restorative practice across children’s services, including introducing an entitlement to family group conferences.
