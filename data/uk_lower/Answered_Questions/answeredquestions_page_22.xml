RDEL (Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit) is current expenditure from within the annual Departmental Expenditure Limits that are set by the Treasury for each government department, and is used in the MoJ and LAA Annual Report &amp; Accounts. It aims to measure the value of all work carried out in each period, regardless of whether it is on cases that have finished. RDEL excludes AME (hence so do the budgeting measures shown in the table). AME (Annually-Managed Expenditure) broadly covers unpredictable or uncontrollable expenditure. In legal aid terms this is work in progress where the payment date is unknown. It can be negative for individual years. In 2013-14, responsibility for Central Funds spending transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Legal Aid Agency.

The reason for this is because in Feb 2017 MOJ rationalised its payrolls and moved to a new payroll system (known as SOP), so any prior year’s data, if available, would need to be sourced from legacy systems. To do this would require raising requests with several legacy suppliers who could then determine if the data was available. The cost of doing this would be disproportionate.

All offenders released on ROTL are subject to rigorous individual risk assessment and licence conditions. Returning with drugs is both a criminal offence and a breach of the licence conditions, which can lead to suspension of ROTL and a return to closed prison conditions, in addition to any other penalty.</p><p> </p><p>Evidence shows the vast majority abide by their temporary release conditions, with the compliance rate standing at well over 99%.

This means, in the event the UK leaves the EU with no deal, the UK Government would fund any remaining payments to farmers, land managers and rural businesses due after October 2019.

The guarantee also means that Defra and the devolved administrations can continue to sign new projects after the UK leaves the EU during 2019 and 2020.</p><p> </p><p>As agriculture is devolved, each administration will have the flexibility to develop agricultural policy suited to their own unique circumstances, once the UK has left the EU.

As a result, the strategy did not set a quantitative target for change. Rather it sets out the government's commitment to establishing a clearer picture of the prevalence of loneliness, through a new national measure and by developing the evidence base on what works. It commits government to publishing annual progress reports that provide an update on the implementation of the policies set out in the strategy, as well as the development of additional policies. As government reviews its approach, and further learning is generated, government will explore the possibility – and suitability – of setting a quantitative target for change.
