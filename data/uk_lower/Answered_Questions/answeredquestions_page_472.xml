"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93541","Department for Education","false","2014-10-21","<p>This Government has introduced an ambitious, coherent programme of reforms to ensure greater consistency in educational outcomes across all stages and regions in England.</p><p>We are reforming assessment and the curriculum across the primary and secondary phases and general and vocational qualifications to ensure we have a system that prepares young people for life in modern Britain. We are reforming GCSEs and A levels to be robust and rigorous, to match the best education systems in the world and to keep pace with universities’ and employers’ demands. The new national curriculum, introduced from this school year, also sets out expectations for children at all four key stages that match the curricula used in the world’s most successful school systems.</p><p>We are improving the accountability framework to improve standards across the country. In addition, Ofsted has implemented a more rigorous inspection framework, with performance data being used to target inspections on the weakest schools and a recognition that any school rated less than ‘good' is not performing well enough.</p><p>Some schools are still not performing well enough. We issued revised statutory guidance[1] to local authorities in May that makes very clear our expectations that they should take swift and robust action when maintained schools are performing poorly. This includes our expectation that their assessment should include the achievement of disadvantaged pupils and that poorly performing schools should become sponsored academies.</p><p>In addition, the academies and free schools programmes are shifting power and responsibility to leaders of education, giving schools greater autonomy to drive improvements, within a strong framework of accountability. The growth in sponsored academies is raising standards by turning around some of the most disadvantaged and worst performing schools in the country. Increasingly, high performing schools are taking the lead as sponsors, sharing their expertise and experience to benefit others.</p><p>Regional Schools Commissioners (RSCs) are responsible for overseeing the performance of academies, free schools, university technical colleges and studio schools in their region. RSCs, along with their headteacher boards, are helping to build the capacity of the Department for Education to pick up local and regional soft intelligence which will contribute to the ability of the Department to oversee academies and free schools and hold them to account. The RSCs will be able to take decisions on academy issues whilst being immersed in the local context. This will enable them to make decisions based on the circumstances of the school(s) and sponsor(s) in question.</p><p>All of these reforms will also help raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and close the gap with their peers at every phase and in every region in England. In particular, the Government introduced the pupil premium in April 2011 – worth a total of £6.25 billion to date – to give schools the resources to raise the attainment of mainly economically disadvantaged pupils and those in care.</p><p>[1] <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-causing-concern--2" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-causing-concern--2</a></p>","Yeovil","Mr David Laws",,"2014-10-21T13:48:27.4584262Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93541/answer","Biography information for Mr David Laws","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93541/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93541/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-10-15","Education: Standards","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she plans to take to ensure greater consistency in educational outcomes (a) from each stage of provision and (b) across all regions.","false","Biography information for Nigel Dodds","Belfast North","Mr Nigel Dodds","210718"

This was set out in the recently revised guidance to local authorities on <em>Schools Causing Concern</em>, which was published in May 2014. Since May 2013, Ofsted has inspected local authority school improvement arrangements which relate to their duty to ensure that, ‘their education functions are exercised with a view to promote high standards and fulfilment of potential’ (Education Act 1996, s13a).</p><p>My Rt. hon. Friend the Minister of State for Schools, has met leaders from the nine local authorities that have failed these inspections to date. These discussions have focused on the attainment of disadvantaged pupils. In addition, in his role as Pupil Premium Champion, Sir John Dunford has worked closely with school leaders in 25 local authority areas with the poorest results for disadvantaged pupils during the 2013/14 school year. This work continues.</p><p>Peer-to-peer support for school leaders is a highly effective way to tackle poor school performance. The Department is therefore increasing the number of National Leaders of Education (NLEs) and the number of teaching schools. The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) has designated over 900 NLEs and establish 602 teaching schools to date, and some local authorities use local teaching school alliances and national leaders to provide school improvement.</p><p>The Talented Leaders programme and School-to-School Support Fund, both launched on 10 September 2014 by the Minister of State for Schools, will also help drive school improvement through better leadership. The Talented Leaders programme will recruit one hundred talented school leaders and deploy them to take on headship positions in challenging schools, working with local authorities who sign up to the programme. The £13m School-to-School Support Fund will support NLEs and teaching schools to undertake deployment in under-performing maintained schools and academies.</p>",,"Lord Nash",,"2014-10-24T11:32:32.2209616Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93684/answer","Biography information for Lord Nash","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93684/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93684/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-10-15","Pupils: Disadvantaged","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they plan to take to co-ordinate good leadership with local authorities to improve the attainment levels of disadvantaged pupils.","false","Biography information for Lord Storey",,"Lord Storey","HL2113"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93353","Ministry of Justice","false","2014-11-18","<p /> <p>The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements are a mechanism through which criminal justice agencies can better discharge their statutory responsibilities and protect the public in a co-ordinated manner. MAPPA is designed to protect the public, including previous victims of crime, from serious harm by sexual and violent offenders. MAPPA is not an agency or body in its own right but rather requires local agencies dealing with offenders to work together in partnership in order to manage risk. MAPPA does not commission or operate interventions or programmes and none is unique to offenders managed under MAPPA.</p><p>Approved Premises (formerly known as probation or bail hostels) are used to provide enhanced supervision for higher-risk offenders who have been released from prison after completing the custodial part of their sentence. They also house a small number of defendants on bail. Requiring higher-risk offenders to reside in an Approved Premises enables us to monitor and supervise them as effectively as possible. Whilst in an Approved Premises, they are subject to a curfew and other controls, whilst Approved Premises staff working closely with local police officers to respond quickly to any signs of escalating risk. It would be much more difficult to monitor them if they were dispersed into less suitable accommodation throughout the community.</p><p>Whether an offender is admitted to an Approved Premises depends on specific monitoring and risk management need. Not all offenders under MAPPA are admitted and not all offenders in Approved Premises are managed under MAPPA. The table below shows the number of offenders managed under MAPPA who were admitted to an Approved Premises in each month between September 2012 and August 2014 (the most recent for which we have full data). Data about offenders who were referred to APs but not admitted is not collected in a way that would allow us to distinguish those under MAPPA management.</p><p>No data is collected about the numbers of offenders who are required to undertake particular programmes or other interventions as part of the terms of their release licences. All offenders, whether or not managed under MAPPA, will undertake some interventions intended to address their offending behaviour and reduce re-offending. The choice of intervention will be tailored to the individual offender’s needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Admissions to Approved Premises September 2012 – August 2014</strong></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Month</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>MAPPA offenders admitted to Approved Premises</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sep 2012</p></td><td><p>776</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oct 2012</p></td><td><p>883</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nov 2012</p></td><td><p>950</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dec 2012</p></td><td><p>741</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jan 2013</p></td><td><p>799</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Feb 2013</p></td><td><p>747</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mar 2103</p></td><td><p>828</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apr 2013</p></td><td><p>857</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>May 2013</p></td><td><p>931</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jun 2013</p></td><td><p>847</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jul 2013</p></td><td><p>963</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Aug 2013</p></td><td><p>901</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sep 2013</p></td><td><p>911</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oct 2013</p></td><td><p>837</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nov 2013</p></td><td><p>842</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dec 2013</p></td><td><p>798</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jan 2014</p></td><td><p>853</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Feb 2014</p></td><td><p>801</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mar 2014</p></td><td><p>782</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apr 2014</p></td><td><p>839</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>May 2014</p></td><td><p>831</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jun 2014</p></td><td><p>803</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jul 2014</p></td><td><p>852</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Aug 2014</p></td><td><p>842</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-11-18T15:58:32.267Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93353/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93353/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93353/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-10-14","Probation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many referrals have been made to Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements Approved Hostels and Interventions, including Programmes in each month of the last two years.","false","Biography information for Martin Horwood","Cheltenham","Martin Horwood","210462"
