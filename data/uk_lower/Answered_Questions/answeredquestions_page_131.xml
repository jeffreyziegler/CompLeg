It is for local authorities to use the full range of enforcement powers available to tackle fly-tipping in their areas. We have recently strengthened these powers by introducing fixed penalty notices for small scale fly-tipping and enhancing the ability of local authorities to search and seize vehicles of suspected fly-tippers. We have also consulted on proposals to introduce a new fixed penalty for householders who pass their waste to a fly-tipper. As two thirds of fly-tipping contains household waste, these additional measures will give local authorities another tool to tackle fly-tipping.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 2016/17 fly-tipping statistics for England were published last October. The statistics show a year-on-year increase in the number of fly-tipping incidents over the last five years. The statistics cover all local authorities and so represent both urban and rural areas. They are available publically and can be found here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We engage with a variety of local authorities and the Local Government Association through the Defra-chaired National Fly-tipping Prevention Group (NFTPG) and work flowing from that. The NFTPG has been meeting regularly for over 10 years to share best practice in partnership working with a common aim to help prevent and tackle fly-tipping together.</p><p> </p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey","157807 ; 157808","2018-07-02T17:24:36.21Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/931568/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/931568/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/931568/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2018-06-26","Fly-tipping: Urban Areas","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what representations his Department has received from local authorities on fly-tipping in urban areas in the last five years.","false","Biography information for Vicky Foxcroft","Lewisham, Deptford","Vicky Foxcroft","157809"

Diagnosis is usually made by taking a medical history, checking symptoms and carrying out a physical examination. Blood tests, x-rays and other scans may be used to rule out medical conditions with similar symptoms to fibromyalgia.</p><p>The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) curriculum includes training in musculoskeletal conditions, and as such, GP training can include fibromyalgia. A key component of a trainee GP’s final assessment, alongside the Clinical Skills Assessment and Workplace Based Assessment, is the applied knowledge test (AKT). The AKT is a summative assessment of the knowledge base that underpins independent general practice in the United Kingdom within the context of the NHS. The content guide for the RCGP, which serves to prepare trainees for the test, includes a specific reference to a required knowledge of fibromyalgia. <em>The Applied Knowledge Test Content Guide</em> is attached.</p><p>A range of support exists to help GPs identify the signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia in primary care. This includes an e-learning course developed by the RCGP and Arthritis Research UK on musculoskeletal care, including fibromyalgia, and a medical guide on diagnosis and treatment developed by the Fibromyalgia Association UK (FMUK) for health professionals. Information for the public can be found on the NHS Choices website and is also available in an online patient information guide produced by FMUK. The <em>Fibromyalgia Guidance for Health Professionals</em> is attached.</p><p>Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, some treatments can ease symptoms and support improved quality of life for patients. The treatments offered will depend on the severity of a patient’s condition, but may include: pharmacological pain relief; physiotherapy; dietary and exercise advice; counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy; and self-management programmes which aim to give patients the skills and confidence to manage their conditions more effectively.
