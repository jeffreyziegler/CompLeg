Under these proposals, we are creating a new form of custodial sentence for offenders convicted of a range of terrorism offences, including possession of an article for terrorist purposes, inciting terrorism overseas and preparation of terrorist acts, under which they will only be released before the end of their custodial term under strict conditions at the discretion of the independent Parole Board.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality standard for antenatal care emphasises the importance of supporting pregnant women to access antenatal care early in pregnancy.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, Start4Life/NHS Information Service for Parents provides parents with advice and information from a trusted source about pregnancy and the first nine months with a baby. The service includes information on how a baby develops, lifestyle advice, including nutrition, exercise and smoking, and how all pregnant women can keep healthy throughout pregnancy and beyond.</p><p> </p><p>Obesity rates in children and adults are levelling off. This stabilisation has been recognised in the OECD Obesity Update published in June 2014. We have a well-developed and wide-ranging programme of actions to reduce levels of obesity. These include working with a wide range of partners including Public Health England, NHS England, Government departments including the Department for Education and Department for Transport, and industry through the Public Health Responsibility Deal. Key initiatives include Change4Life, the National Child Measurement Programme, NHS Health checks, Change4Life Sports Clubs, School Sports Funding and the School Food Plan.</p><p> </p><p>Since 2001, the under 75 mortality rate for coronary heart disease (CHD) has fallen by 46% and by 42% for stroke. The Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes Strategy was published in 2013.

Since October 2010, the Cancer Drugs Fund has helped over 50,000 cancer patients in England. The National Institute for Health Research investment in cancer research rose from £101 million 2010-11 to £133 million in 2012-13.

It was introduced in 2008 and subsequently updated in 2010, and requires internet service providers to provide consumers with information on the maximum speed they can achieve, including an estimated speed range, to help ensure that consumers choose the package that is the most appropriate for them in light of their individual circumstances and needs. All the largest internet service providers representing 98% of the broadband consumer market are signed up to the Code and have agreed to abide by its principles and spirit. Headline broadband speeds advertised are unlikely to be achievable all the time. There are a variety of reasons for broadband speed variations, not all of which are within the broadband service provider�s control. The important thing is that consumers receive accurate information on broadband speeds at the point of sale to allow them to make informed purchasing decisions, and ensure that there is not a mismatch between the speeds they expect to receive and what they actually get.</p><p> </p><p>Ofcom has undertaken successive mystery shopping exercises to check compliance with the Code. Results have shown that the level of compliance has continued to improve. The latest results published in May 2013 found that overall 96% of mystery shopping callers were provided with a speed estimate (93% in 2011/12). There was also an improvement overall in the provision of speeds information provided to mystery shoppers via the web. All signatories to the Code, with the exception of two small providers, offered a speed checker which provide estimated access line speeds. The percentage of assessments where any speed estimate was given via the website rose from 87% in 2011/12 to 92% in 2013.</p><p> </p><p>Ofcom is currently discussing with industry and consumer groups, its proposals to revise the Code to reflect significant changes in the broadband market since the Code�s introduction, with the increased take up of superfast packages.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/66123","Home Office","false","2014-08-06","<p>Prevent aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. The revised Prevent strategy published in June 2011 has three key objectives. These are to: <br>• respond to the ideological challenge of terrorism and the threat we face from <br>those who promote it;<br>• prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and ensure that they are given <br>appropriate advice and support; and <br>• work with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation <br>which we need to address.<br>The delivery of Prevent requires strong partnerships with a range of local groups in the community, including British Muslims amongst others. <br>The Prevent strategy we inherited from the last Government was flawed. It confused the delivery of Government policy to promote integration with Government policy to prevent terrorism, which was a source of mistrust. That is why we refocused the Prevent strategy in 2011, to separate Prevent from broader integration work. <br><br>Local Prevent co-ordinators across the country work with local services, partners such as the police, Charity Commission and members of local faith communities, to understand local risks and needs, and deliver targeted projects and outreach work. We fund 30 Prevent priority areas to work on the frontline and with those vulnerable to extremism, including funding projects tailored to local needs. Prevent co-ordinators provide regular feedback to the Home Office, which helps shape the future development and implementation of the Prevent strategy. <br><br>Preventing terrorism means challenging extremist (and non-violent) ideas that are also part of a terrorist ideology. The Prevent strategy focuses on all forms of terrorism, but is clear that the most serious risk to our national security comes from Al Qa’ida, its affiliates and like-minded organisations. For this reason, the report of the Prime Minister’s Extremism Task Force (ETF), published last December, set out a definition of Islamist extremism. It noted that this ideology should not be confused with traditional religious practice. It is based on a distorted interpretation of Islam, which betrays Islam’s peaceful principles and also includes the uncompromising belief that people cannot be Muslim and British, and insists that those who do not agree with them are not true Muslims.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire",,"2014-08-06T10:37:55.8609961Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/66123/answer","Biography information for James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/66123/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/66123/answer","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/66123/answer/previousversion/9748","Biography information for James Brokenshire","1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-07-07","Community Relations: Islam","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment she has made of levels of trust held by the British Muslim community in the Prevent strategy.","false","Biography information for Greg Mulholland","Leeds North West","Greg Mulholland","204223"

Of this, £94.6 million will support transport schemes that have been bid for by the LEP and will make a real difference to transport accessibility in the whole of the Thames Valley.

This includes just over £2 million of Local Pinch Point Funding, £16.1million investment in improving the state of the roads and on small scale transport schemes and around £2 million from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund to ease congestion by promoting travel behaviour change through a package of sustainable travel measures aimed at residents, schools and businesses.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to investment in the local network the Government continues to progress the M4 smart motorway. A further formal public consultation on the scheme will be held in the autumn and subject to development consent and the final business case, construction could start in late Summer 2016. As well as this the Highways Agency is taking forward a £2.5 million scheme to improve the links between the M4 and A329(M), to provide increased capacity at the junction and improve traffic flows.
