DFID has again pledged, in our manifesto commitments, to support 11m girls and boys with a decent education between 2015 and 2020.

At the Conference our ambition is that international donors, governments from countries in the region hosting refugees, non-governmental organisations and the private sector come together to agree a set of reciprocal financial and policy commitments. This will be a new model for providing education to children in a protracted crisis.</p><p>DFID is also financing, with partners, a technical design process for a new Global Platform and Financing Facility for education in emergencies to improve how education is delivered globally in crisis.

The <em>Code of Practice</em> defines the attainment of a place in higher education as a successful outcome.</p><p>Local authorities are not responsible for the education of young people in higher education. The sector has its own support system in the form of the Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA). It would not be sensible for these systems to overlap. For example, it would not be reasonable to hold a local authority to account for securing special educational provision for a young people in an independent higher education institution.</p><p>In the academic year 2013/14, the last year for which full figures are available, DSA totalling £152.7m was provided to 68,500 undergraduate and postgraduate students. The Government also currently provides annual funding to publicly funded institutions, through the Disability element of the Student Opportunity Funding of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) grant, to help them recruit and support disabled students. This funding rose to £20 million for 2015/16, an increase of £5 million on the previous year.</p><p>The <em>Code of Practice</em> provides guidance on the transition to higher education. It says that good transition planning should include:</p><ul><li>sharing the EHC plan with the university (with the young person’s consent);</li><li>ensuring the young person is aware of DSA and has made an early application, so that support is in place when their university course begins; and</li><li>ensuring the continuity of health and care services where these continue to be required by the young person.</li></ul><p>In addition we are working with those conducting DSA assessments to ensure that they understand EHC plans and how they can assist and inform assessments.</p><p>As independent and autonomous bodies, higher education institutions are entirely responsible for addressing any issues of discrimination that might come to their attention. The Government provides a legal framework for individuals, which protects their right not to be discriminated against – primarily through the Equality Act 2010. Through the Equality Act, higher education institutions are prohibited by law from discriminating against students with protected characteristics, such as disability.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson",,"2016-02-02T14:54:45.247Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/447315/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/447315/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/447315/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-01-25","Students: Disability","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, for what reason statutory guidance Special Educational Needs and Disability Code of Practice: 0 to 25 years (2015) does not apply to higher education institutions.","false","Biography information for Mr David Anderson","Blaydon","Mr David Anderson","24047"

Experts estimate the programme saves up to 5,000 lives per year in the United Kingdom.</p><p> </p><p>The NHS Breast Screening Programme invites women aged 50 to 70 for breast screening every three years. Women over 70 can request free three yearly screening. The 2012 UK independent review of breast cancer screening (Marmot review) estimated that inviting women between the ages of 50 to 70 reduces mortality from breast cancer in the invited population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year in the UK.</p><p> </p><p>The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme offers screening using a self-sampling kit, the guaiac Faecal Occult Blood test (FOB), every two years to men and women aged 60 to 74.</p><p>The UK National Screening Committee has recommended that the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) be used as the primary test for bowel cancer instead of the currently used FOB test. Ministers are now considering the UK NSC’s recommendation.</p><p> </p><p>The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is currently rolling out Bowel Scope Screening (BSS), an additional one off examination which will play a significant role in preventing bowel cancer. Both men and women are being invited for BSS around the time of their 55th birthday with the aim of detecting and removing any adenomas (polyps) at an early stage to prevent bowel cancer from developing. Evidence shows that men and women aged 55-64 attending a one-off bowel scope screening test for bowel cancer could reduce their individual mortality from the disease by 43% (31% on a whole population basis) and reduce their individual incidence of bowel cancer by 33% (23% on a whole population basis).</p><p><strong> </strong></p>",,"Lord Prior of Brampton",,"2016-02-08T13:04:46.393Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/447501/answer","Biography information for Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/447501/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/447501/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-01-25","Cancer","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they are taking through early diagnosis and screening programmes to reduce the risk of cancer.","false","Biography information for Baroness Redfern",,"Baroness Redfern","HL5403"
