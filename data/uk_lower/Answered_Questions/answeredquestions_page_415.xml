Data on net spending on contract and agency staff for NHS trusts (including Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust) is unaudited financial data taken from the NHS Summarisation Schedules and consolidated figures were published in the Department’s Annual Report and Accounts. These data sets were collected for the first time in 2013/14.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The figures for NHS trusts exclude spending on bank staff. Data on temporary/agency staff reported in the Department’s Annual Report and Accounts include payments to external bodies such as NHS Professionals for the supply of bank staff, working extra hours at NHS rates of pay. The above table presents data excluding spending on bank staff using unaudited figures for the element of NHS trust expenditure relating to bank staff.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. NHS trusts existing in 2013/14 were asked to also provide prior year figures (2012/13) for Contract and Agency staff in the NHS Summarisation Schedules. These figures have not been included in the answer as the data provided only includes information from existing 2013/14 NHS trusts, rather than data from all 2012/13 trusts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The prior year figures included in Table C12 of the published accounts have not been included in the answer, as they were compiled on a different basis to the 2013/14 figures. The figures published for 2012/13 for NHS trusts are based on non-permanently employed staff which is defined as “others engaged on the objectives of the organisation and will include staff on inward secondment or loan from other organisations, bank/agency/temporary staff and contract staff.” This reconciles to the figures for those organisations in note 3 (Staff Costs 2012/13), whereas the 2013-14 figures are compiled for the first time under a stricter definition of contingent labour.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The figure for 2013/14 Contract and Agency staff spend for all NHS trusts reported in the published accounts under the heading “Temporary/Agency” (Table C12 page 197) is £1.184 billion. This is understated as one organisation did not provide the data, so the answer is based on a higher figure (including spend on bank staff) of £1.209 billion.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. In the guidance that accompanied the data collection, the definition of Contract / Agency staff is: “Agency” employee payments for the employment of staff where the staff remain employees of the agency and “Contract staff” where the NHS trust has control over numbers and qualifications of staff (in contrast to a service obtained under contract) .</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Excluded from the “Agency/Contract” category are the costs of staff recharged by another organisation where no element of overhead is included i.e. where the staff costs are shared between the NHS Trust and other bodies; staff on secondment or on loan from other organisations; amounts payable to contractors in respect of the provision of services (for example, cleaning or security).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Where an NHS trust obtains foundation trust status part way through any year, the data provided is only for the part of the year the organisation operated as an NHS Trust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. For the first time in 2013/14 the figures for NHS trusts and foundation trusts have been aggregated and published in the Departmental Annual Accounts together under the heading “NHS Providers”. Figures provided separately for either sector will include a small amount of cross-sector transactions that would ordinarily be eliminated if the figures were provided at group level.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.

Data on net spending on agency staff presented for foundation trusts for last four quarters is unaudited data from in-year returns of NHS foundation trusts.

To ensure that assessments are carried out in a manner that is suitable to the adult, the Care and Support (Assessment) Regulations 2014 requires all assessments to be carried out in in an appropriate and proportionate manner and have regard to:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) the wishes and preferences of the individual;</p><p> </p><p>(b) the outcomes the individual seeks from the assessment; and</p><p> </p><p>(c) the severity and overall extent of the individual’s needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care Act statutory guidance clarifies that “an assessment should be carried out over an appropriate and reasonable timescale taking into account the urgency of needs and a consideration of any fluctuation in those needs. Local authorities should inform the individual of an indicative timescale over which their assessment will be conducted and keep the person informed throughout the process”.</p><p> </p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt","4789","2015-07-08T13:33:24.713Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386559/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386559/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386559/answer",,,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-06-30","Social Services","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what guidance his Department issues to local authorities on the length of time a care and support assessment following a referral should take.","false","Biography information for Greg Mulholland","Leeds North West","Greg Mulholland","4828"

Domestically, forestland is a net sink in the UK, removing 17 Mtonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2013) and the amount of carbon stored in UK trees increased from 1990-2013. Forestry inventory projections indicate an increasing trend in net removals by UK forests and then a decline towards mid-century as forests mature (in mature forests carbon uptake is reduced) and more trees are harvested. Nonetheless, forests will remain a net sink in the UK, at least beyond the middle of the century.</p><p>Forestry policy is devolved, and all four countries have established policies for woodland creation, co-financed through the EU Rural Development Program. The revised UK Forestry Standard, published in November 2011 provides that ‘forest management should contribute to climate change mitigation over the long term through the net capture and storage of carbon in the forest ecosystem and in wood products’. The Committee on Climate Change has estimated that by 2030 an additional 1 megaton of carbon dioxide a year could be abated through afforestation activities.</p><p>Internationally, deforestation causes 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reaching the goals of the New York Declaration on Forests – ending forest loss by 2030 and restoring 350 million hectares – is estimated to reduce between 4.5 and 8.8 billion tonnes of CO2 per year in 2030. Over 1 billion poor people depend on forests for their livelihoods, they provide essential ecosystem services and support up to 80 per cent of terrestrial biodiversity. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has taken a number of steps to mitigate forests emissions and enhance sequestration. In the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020), all countries with emissions reductions commitments (including the European Union) are required to account for all forest related emissions and removals, and are therefore incentivised to sustainably manage their forests.</p><p>For developing countries, the UNFCCC has established ‘REDD+’ as a mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and promote the conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks by rewarding countries who protect their forests with a payment based on verified emissions reductions. The UK’s £3.87 billion <em>International Climate Fund </em>supports developing countries address deforestation, including programmes which support REDD+, governance and market reforms, curbing illegal and unsustainable use of forest resources, and investments in sustainable forestry, agriculture and land management.</p>","South Northamptonshire","Andrea Leadsom",,"2015-07-08T13:09:13.573Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386616/answer","Biography information for Andrea Leadsom","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386616/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386616/answer","South Northamptonshire","South Northamptonshire","Andrea Leadsom","Andrea Leadsom","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386616/answer/previousversion/11499","Biography information for Andrea Leadsom","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386616/answer/previousversion/11499","Biography information for Andrea Leadsom","63","Energy and Climate Change","Energy and Climate Change","2015-06-30","Carbon Capture and Storage: Trees","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, what assessment her Department has made of the importance of trees and tree planting to achieving carbon capture.","false","Biography information for Anne-Marie Trevelyan","Berwick-upon-Tweed","Mrs Anne-Marie Trevelyan","4922"

An FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.</p><p> </p><p>2. The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 4 prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in an HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients undergoing a ‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two procedures – removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one – counted in a single episode.</p><p> </p><p>3. A number of codes were used to identify hip, shoulder and knee replacements which include conversions and revisions to existing replacements.</p><p> </p><p>4. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely, apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information.</p><p> </p><p>Note that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March, e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.</p><p> </p>","Ipswich","Ben Gummer",,"2015-07-07T15:35:06.147Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386680/answer","Biography information for Ben Gummer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386680/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386680/answer",,,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-06-30","Musculoskeletal Disorders: Surgery","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, how many NHS (a) hip, (b) shoulder and (c) knee replacement operations were carried out in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","4867"

We do not tolerate drugs in prison and anyone caught with them will be punished and could face further prosecution.</p><p> </p><p>The success of the strategy is illustrated by the reduction of drug misuse in prisons, as measured by the random Mandatory Drug Testing (MDT) programme, which has declined by 17.5 percentage points over the past 17 years, despite the fact that NOMS is testing for more drugs than previously. Positive rates were 7.8% in 2009/2010 and 6.9% in 2014/2015.</p><p> </p><p>NOMS is aware of the increase of the use of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) across the prison estate and there is a wide-ranging programme of work being undertaken to counteract NPS. This includes joint work with the Home Office on legislation to control most NPS substances and make it illegal to supply any NPS. This will allow prisons to press for the prosecution of those smuggling NPS into prisons. Additionally, work is underway to develop new drug tests to detect NPS substances, to strengthen perimeter defences, and to train drug dogs to detect NPS.</p><p> </p><p>We have already made it a criminal offence to throw drugs and other items over prison walls and the government's proposed new legislation will further strengthen our powers.

The first body scanner has been purchased and a programme of work is underway to assess the most effective way to deploy body scanners across the estate, based on experience of their use in an operational setting.

However, it is not always possible to put the value of spending down to certain parts of the country on a ‘who benefits’ basis and this is particularly a problem for spending on motorways and trunk roads (by Highways England) and on the rail network, which two headings together comprise the majority of Department for Transport expenditure. As in previous years, this expenditure is therefore broadly allocated on an ‘in’ basis (i.e. the location where the spending took place) in the Treasury analysis.</p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p>It is important to note however that expenditure comparisons on a ‘per-head’ basis (using resident populations) can present a skewed picture of the distribution of benefits for transport generally, and for transport in London particularly. This is because the transport networks in London are routinely used by a very large number of other regions’ residents and it is not just Londoners who are receiving the benefits of the transport expenditure there.</p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p>Even allowing for this point, one would also expect London’s ‘per head’ transport expenditure to be higher than the national average. London provides key international travel gateways for the whole of the country. London is also densely populated with different public transport and infrastructure demands – for example London residents comprise around 15% of the population of England, but London accounts for around half of all bus passenger journeys in England, and almost two-thirds of rail journeys in Great Britain.</p><p /> <p> </p><p /> <p> </p><p> </p>","Harrogate and Knaresborough","Andrew Jones",,"2015-07-08T07:07:45.38Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386764/answer","Biography information for Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386764/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/386764/answer",,,,,,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2015-06-30","Public Transport","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what the total amount of capital funding per capita on public transport was in each English region in each of the last five financial years.","false","Biography information for Rebecca Long Bailey","Salford and Eccles","Rebecca Long Bailey","4842"
