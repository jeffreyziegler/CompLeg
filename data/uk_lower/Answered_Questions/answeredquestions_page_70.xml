This year, NHS England’s independent advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, recommended a new approach to health inequalities which was reflected in the CCG allocations published on 10 January 2019. The 2019/20 component of the increase for areas with high health inequalities, which is already included in the aforementioned CCG allocations, will be available from the start of the financial year.</p><p>The core allocations formula for primary medical care accounts for greater needs for healthcare in more deprived parts of England, and a further adjustment reflects NHS England’s objectives to tackle health inequalities and address unmet need for health services. This adjustment, which targets 15% of the total primary medical care allocation, is based on data on premature mortality at a small area level, aggregated up to CCG level, and thus takes account of inequalities within as well as between CCGs.</p><p>In addition, the new five-year framework for general practitioner contract reform sets out the requirements for a Directed Enhanced Service (DES) for Primary Care Networks, which includes addressing Inequalities as one of seven national service specifications. The timetable for introducing the Network Contract DES is set out in section 4.15 of the five-year framework. Details specifically relating to the Inequalities service specification can be found in section 6.32 and 6.33.

It is targeted at artificial tax avoidance schemes where earnings were paid in the form of non-repayable loans made by a third party. The loans are provided on terms that mean they are not repaid in practice, so they are no different to normal income and are, and always have been, taxable.</p><p> </p><p>The Government estimates that up to 50,000 individuals will be affected by the 2019 loan charge. Information is not held at constituency, borough or regional level.</p><p> </p><p>Since the announcement of the 2019 loan charge at Budget 2016, HMRC has now agreed settlements on disguised remuneration schemes with employers and individuals totalling over £1 billion. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) liabilities fall on the employer in the first instance. The charge on DR loans does not change this principle and the employee will only be liable where the amount cannot reasonably be collected from the employer, such as where the employer is offshore or no longer exists. Around 85% of the settlement yield since 2016 is from employers, with less than 15% from individuals. HMRC will never force somebody to sell their main home to pay for their DR debt, or the loan charge.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC is working hard to help individuals get out of avoidance for good and offer manageable and sustainable payment plans wherever possible. It carefully considers each case and there is no maximum limit on how long a customer can be given to pay what they owe. HMRC considers a customer’s ability to pay on a case by case basis and decisions are based on each individual’s personal circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has simplified the process for those who want to settle their use of DR schemes before the loan charge arises. DR scheme users who currently have an income of less than £50,000 and are no longer engaging in tax avoidance can automatically agree a payment plan of up to five years without the need to give HMRC detailed information about their income and assets. This arrangement has been extended to 7 years for scheme users who have an income of less than £30,000.</p><p> </p><p>Anybody who is worried about being able to pay what they owe should get in touch with HMRC as soon as possible. They have a number of ways to help those who are genuinely unable to make a full payment of tax on time, for example, by arranging payments by instalments.</p>","Central Devon","Mel Stride",,"2019-02-18T17:25:01.447Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1060860/answer","Biography information for Mel Stride","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1060860/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1060860/answer",,,,,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2019-02-13","Tax Avoidance: Greater London","1","House of Commons","To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, how many people are affected by the 2019 Loan Charge in (a) Camberwell and Peckham and (b) London Borough of Southwark and (c) London.","false","Biography information for Ms Harriet Harman","Camberwell and Peckham","Ms Harriet Harman","220724"

This guidance provides advice on the prescribing of liothyronine and on the review of National Health Service patients who are being prescribed liothyronine. The guidance supports clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and Area Prescribing Committees in local decision making and enables a consistent approach for the exceptional circumstances in which patients have an ongoing need for liothyronine.</p><p>The guidance states that “As specified by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, clinicians have an ethical responsibility to adhere to the highest professional standards of good medical practice rooted in sound evidence. This includes not prescribing potentially harmful therapies without proven advantages over existing treatments’. The RMOC therefore recommends that strict criteria are applied to ensure that liothyronine is only prescribed in the very rare situations where alternative treatments have been found to be inadequate. In such circumstances, an ongoing shared care arrangement may be appropriate if agreed by local commissioners. If a patient is ever initiated on treatment, prescribing responsibility should remain with the hospital consultant for at least 3 months”.</p><p>CCG are expected to have regard to national guidance, and are responsible for developing their own local approaches to its implementation taking into account local priorities and needs.</p><p>Any patient who feels they have suffered harm as a result of NHS treatment may raise the matter, in writing, electronically, or orally, with the service provider, or with the commissioner of the service.

That is why the Department for Education is taking forward a number of measures across its portfolio to support the sector to promote integration. We want educational settings that prepare all children, young people and adults to participate fully in life in modern Britain, and equip children and young people with the skills, knowledge and values to become active citizens. All schools and colleges are required to teach a broad and balanced curriculum which promotes the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils, and to promote our shared values of democracy, rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.</p><p>School linking programmes are an important element of our integration agenda. Providing opportunities for young people to have meaningful interactions with those from different backgrounds helps build understanding of different communities and cultures, fosters more positive attitudes, promotes social cohesion and inter-communal trust. Social mixing and school linking are grounded in contact theory, with studies consistently finding that contact between groups of young people from different backgrounds creates more positive attitudes and can increase cohesion. This is particularly evidenced in recent findings by the University of Bristol and London School of Economics[1].</p><p>The Department for Education co-funds, with the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, The Linking Network which links all kinds of schools to help children explore questions of identity, diversity, equality and community cohesion. The Linking Network uses a data analysis tool to ensure that it is only linking together pupil populations from different backgrounds, including young people of different faiths, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds and from different areas.</p><p>Diversity of intake is also important, and that is why we are taking forward our commitment, as set out in the Integrated Communities Action Plan, to develop model admissions arrangements.

As set out by section 95, the Government will lay a report no later than 30 March 2019. The report will review the effect of changes made to the time limits for assessment where tax loss arises in relation to offshore tax, and compare these with other legislation including the charge on disguised remuneration loans.</p><p>The charge on disguised remuneration loans remains unchanged as a result of the requirement for a report, and will apply to disguised remuneration loan balances on 5 April 2019.</p><p>The charge on disguised remuneration (DR) loans will apply to outstanding DR loan balances on 5 April 2019. It is targeted at artificial tax avoidance schemes where earnings were paid in the form of non-repayable loans made by a third party. The loans are provided on terms that mean they are not repaid in practice, so they are no different to normal income and are, and always have been, taxable.</p><p> </p><p>The Government estimates that up to 50,000 individuals will be affected by the 2019 loan charge. Information is not held at constituency, borough or regional level.</p><p> </p><p>Since the announcement of the 2019 loan charge at Budget 2016, HMRC has now agreed settlements on disguised remuneration schemes with employers and individuals totalling over £1 billion. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) liabilities fall on the employer in the first instance. The charge on DR loans does not change this principle and the employee will only be liable where the amount cannot reasonably be collected from the employer, such as where the employer is offshore or no longer exists. Around 85% of the settlement yield since 2016 is from employers, with less than 15% from individuals. HMRC will never force somebody to sell their main home to pay for their DR debt, or the loan charge.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC is working hard to help individuals get out of avoidance for good and offer manageable and sustainable payment plans wherever possible. It carefully considers each case and there is no maximum limit on how long a customer can be given to pay what they owe. HMRC considers a customer’s ability to pay on a case by case basis and decisions are based on each individual’s personal circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has simplified the process for those who want to settle their use of DR schemes before the loan charge arises. DR scheme users who currently have an income of less than £50,000 and are no longer engaging in tax avoidance can automatically agree a payment plan of up to five years without the need to give HMRC detailed information about their income and assets. This arrangement has been extended to 7 years for scheme users who have an income of less than £30,000.</p><p> </p><p>Anybody who is worried about being able to pay what they owe should get in touch with HMRC as soon as possible. They have a number of ways to help those who are genuinely unable to make a full payment of tax on time, for example, by arranging payments by instalments.</p>","Central Devon","Mel Stride",,"2019-02-18T17:20:20.597Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1059735/answer","Biography information for Mel Stride","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1059735/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1059735/answer",,,,,,,,"14","Treasury","Treasury","2019-02-12","Tax Avoidance","1","House of Commons","To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will make it his policy to delay the loan charge settlement day until after the conclusion of the review of that charge.","false","Biography information for Grant Shapps","Welwyn Hatfield","Grant Shapps","220152"

These responses set out further details of the initiatives referred to in that letter.</p><p>We have launched a school improvement support offer which means schools eligible for support have access to up to 3 days free advice from a national leader of education (NLE). A subset of these schools, judged as 'requires improvement' in their last 2 Ofsted inspections, will have access of up to £16,000 of funded support to address the needs identified by the NLE. In the Sheffield City Region and across the North, a first cohort of schools is currently being offered school improvement support with further eligible schools to be identified later in 2019. In addition, there are 10 projects funded through the Strategic School Improvement Fund (SSIF) where the lead applicant is based in the Sheffield City Region. In total these projects have been awarded over £3 million. These are among the 57 SSIF projects where the lead applicant is based in the Northern Powerhouse area. In total, these projects have been awarded just over £20 million. The complete list of successful applicants is available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-school-improvement-fund-successful-applicants/strategic-school-improvement-fund-ssif-successful-applicants" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-school-improvement-fund-successful-applicants/strategic-school-improvement-fund-ssif-successful-applicants</a>.</p><p>A further cohort of schools in the Sheffield City Region and across the North, identified as facing significant challenges with teacher recruitment and retention, is receiving funded support to address those issues.</p><p>The department is working closely with the social mobility partnership South Yorkshire Futures, on our shared aims of improving educational outcomes across the Sheffield City Region and has seconded 3 members of staff to support their programme.

Doncaster Opportunity Area is one of those areas and is working closely with South Yorkshire Futures on a number of their interventions. This includes work to improve teacher recruitment and retention in the county through funding newly qualified teacher mentoring and collaborating with the Sheffield City Region on our newly-launched Careers Hub, which aims to improve the quality of careers information, advice and guidance given to young people in the borough.</p><p>‘Educating the North’ recommended that the Opportunity Areas programme be extended to the North East. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State announced Opportunity North East in October 2018.

To further help offenders rehabilitate and disengage from extremism and terrorism, JEXU has rolled out a theological intervention programme. A small group of chaplains are receiving specialised training and ongoing support to lead this important capability. Finally, two Separation Centres have been opened for those individuals whose extremist risk cannot be managed effectively in the mainstream prison population, as a safeguarding measure to protect prisoners from terrorist and extremist influences, and to reduce the ongoing risk they present to national security despite their imprisonment.</p>","South East Cambridgeshire","Lucy Frazer",,"2019-02-19T12:03:54.677Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1060032/answer","Biography information for Lucy Frazer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1060032/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1060032/answer",,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-02-12","Prisons: Radicalism","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what steps his Department is taking to reduce Islamic extremism in prisons.","false","Biography information for Andrew Rosindell","Romford","Andrew Rosindell","220119"
