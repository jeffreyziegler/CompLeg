The Government response to this consultation was published on 16 September 2015. This response provides detail on which organisations and types of payments the Government intends to capture within the scope of the public sector exit payment cap. This accords with the Government’s manifesto commitment to end tax payer funded six figure payoffs for public sector workers.</p><p>The response document can be found at the following link: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/464367/Public_sector_exit_payments_response.pdf</p><p>The exit payment cap will apply to payments made as a result of an employee leaving their employment. It will <strong>not</strong> affect any pension a person has earned through their years of service or have any impact on accrued pension rights or pension lump sum entitlements on retirement. It will capture contributions, made by the employer, to fund early access to an unreduced or partially reduced pension. This is because such costs are ultimately funded by the tax payer.</p><p>The Government has been clear that early retirements relating to ill health are outside the scope of the cap and will not be affected. Additionally, any payments directed by a Court or Tribunal will not be included in the scope of the cap.</p><p>Exits on compassionate grounds are not such a clearly defined concept as exits related to ill health or redundancy. There will generally be a large degree of employer discretion on the terms of such exits, and on any payments. In these cases there will be discretion available to relax the cap in individual cases, subject to relevant Ministerial or local council approval, as will be set out in further detail in forthcoming Treasury guidance and directions.</p>","Chelsea and Fulham","Greg Hands","24767","2016-02-02T17:28:20.583Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448585/answer","Biography information for Greg Hands","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448585/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448585/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2016-01-28","Public Sector: Redundancy Pay","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, which public sector organisations will not be covered by the public sector exit payments cap proposed in the Enterprise Bill.","false","Biography information for Kevin Brennan","Cardiff West","Kevin Brennan","24793"

Commitments made at the Conference will help to create 1.1 million jobs and provide education to an additional 1 million children. The UK remains at the forefront of the response to the crisis in Syria and the region. We have doubled our commitment and have now pledged a total of over £2.3 billion, our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis. The outcomes of the conference are reflected in the Co-hosts' statement available on the Conference website <a href="http://www.supportingsyria2016.com/" target="_blank">www.supportingsyria2016.com</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The Department for International Development continues to hold regular conversations with the UN and International non-governmental organisations (INGOs) on the issue of humanitarian access inside Syria. We have provided support to the UN and INGOs since the start of the conflict to deliver aid in hard to reach and besieged areas of Syria. Our funding model inside Syria is designed to give maximum flexibility to UN agencies to respond quickly when pockets of humanitarian access open up.</p><p> </p><p>However, in the past year, only 10% of all requests submitted by the UN to the regime to access besieged and hard to reach areas have been approved and delivered. That is why the UK lobbied hard for UN Security Council resolutions 2165, 2191 and 2258, enabling the UN to deliver aid across borders without the consent of the regime. As a result, 240 shipments of cross-border aid have been delivered by road to Syrians in need.</p><p> </p><p>Attempting to deliver humanitarian assistance without the consent of the parties to the conflict is extremely challenging. There is a risk that shipments of humanitarian assistance would be physically stopped and confiscated, humanitarian staff placed in danger and that convoys could come under attack. Likewise, delivering assistance without consent may risk undermining ongoing negotiations on humanitarian access to the 4.6 million people in hard to reach areas across Syria.</p><p> </p><p>Consequently, the most effective way to get food to people who are starving and stop these needless and horrific deaths is for Assad and all parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law. We continue to call on all parties to allow immediate and unfettered access to all areas of Syria. On 4 February, the Supporting Syria and the Region Conference also brought leaders together to demand an end to these abuses and obstruction of humanitarian aid.</p><p> </p>","New Forest West","Mr Desmond Swayne",,"2016-02-08T16:49:54.193Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448678/answer","Biography information for Sir Desmond Swayne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448678/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448678/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-01-28","Syria: Overseas Aid","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, what discussions she has had with the UN on its aid agencies requiring permission from the Syrian regime in order to deliver aid within that country.","false","Biography information for Greg Mulholland","Leeds North West","Greg Mulholland","24656"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448160","Ministry of Defence","false","2016-02-10","<p>Military training is provided for all new Reservists and the training provided is dependent on which of the Services they join. Detailed below are the specific training details for each Service:</p><p> </p><p><strong>ROYAL NAVY</strong></p><p> </p><p>Reservists new to the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) and the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR) undertake tailored training programmes that reflect as closely as possible that undertaken during Regular service initial (Phase 1) training. This is provided in a blended format consisting of; Marine Reserve unit training nights, engagement (currently only RNR) with material on a virtual learning environment hosted on the defence intranet gateway, a number of dedicated weekends which then lead to attendance on a two week Confirmation Course that allows the Reservist to pass out alongside their Regular counterparts at the relevant Naval Service Initial training establishment.</p><p>For the RNR, that blended initial training develops Core Maritime Skills (CMS) and includes basic health and safety, learning to live together on a mess deck and in field conditions, basic fitness (including passing a swimming test), parade training, operating in the maritime environment, weapon handling, damage control and general naval knowledge. For the RMR, Unit training is focused on building physical endurance, whilst weekends develop Military Annual Training Test (MATT) skills for operating in field conditions and includes basic field admin, harbour routines, field craft and navigation, and patrolling. Throughout initial training the RNR and RMR are tested to the same basic standards as their regular counterparts and on successful completion are awarded the same competencies.</p><p>Potential RNR Officers must pass the Admiralty Interview Board (AIB) before commencing RNR Initial Naval Training (INT). Their first year (RNR INT 1A) is a similar programme to RNR Ratings, which build CMS and the fundamentals of being an officer prior to a Pre-assessment weekend ahead of attending the two weeks RNR Officers Confirmation Course at the Britannia Royal Naval College. Their second year (RNR INT1B) focuses on developing Command, Leadership and Management as well as three weekends and two weeks at sea on a RN warship. Completion of RNR Officers INT is achieved by gaining a pass at the RNR Fleet Board.</p><p> </p><p>In their third year of training, RNR Junior Officers undertake the Divisional Officers Course and Junior Officers Leadership 1 Course. Attendees can select to undertake either the RN version of these courses or RNR versions (run at weekends).</p><p> </p><p>Aspiring RMR Officers will have come through RMR Other Ranks training to gain their Green Beret before attending AIB. On successful completion and in the following two years they will undertake four two-week training packages alongside their regular counterparts at Commando Training Centre Royal Marines. In-unit training (drill nights and weekends) is a significant part of the development programme to build RMR and Officer ethos and completion of officer training is signified by successful assessment of their training log.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ARMY</strong></p><p>Those seeking a commission as an officer with the Army Reserve and who pass the Army Officer Selection Board undertake the Army Reserve Commissioning Course at Sandhurst. This consists of four two-week modules, the first two of which can be taken in other ways (e.g. through a University Officer Training Corps).</p><p>The training provided to new members of the Army Reserve is broadly similar in design to that of their Regular counterparts and shares much of the resources, facilities and equipment available for Regular training. Both Reserve and Regular recruits undertake initial ‘Phase 1’ training in order to become effective soldiers and then proceed to ‘Phase 2’ training, where they receive the specific training they need to carry out their defined role.</p><p>The first part of initial training for the Army Reserve is known as Phase 1 (Alpha) and is delivered over four training weekends at one of the nine regional Army Training Units, or in a single week-long consolidated period, usually at one of the Army Training Regiments, where Regular recruits also undergo their Phase 1 training. The second part is known as Phase 1 (Bravo) and is delivered at an Army Training Unit by regular instructors over a period of 16 days.</p><p>Phase 2 role-specific training is undertaken at the same training locations as Regular Phase 2 training. Infantry training is carried out at Infantry Training Centre, Catterick through the Combat Infantryman’s Course (Reserves.)</p><p> </p><p><strong>ROYAL AIRFORCE (RAF)</strong></p><p> </p><p>For the RAF Reserves, new recruits undertake four weekends of basic military education and training on their units before attending a two week residential course at RAF Halton where they train alongside regular recruits at the Recruit Training Centre. This is referred to as Phase 1 training. Regular recruits undertake a 10 week course.</p><p>For the Reservists who will undergo officer training, on completion of the course at RAF Halton, training continues at RAF College Cranwell which consists of four weekends and a two week residential course.</p><p>On completion of the Phase 1 course recruits undertake trade specific training referred to as Phase 2. The delivery of Phase 2 to Regulars is through a variety of courses on the training schools taking different lengths of time depending on the Trade. For Reservists, professional training is delivered through a mixed economy of on unit training and modular training at training schools. Over time the modular training builds the Reservist to the same trained standard as the Regular. All Reservist training is designed, delivered and accredited in the same way as Regular trade training.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",,"Earl Howe",,"2016-02-10T17:26:22.033Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448160/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448160/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/448160/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-01-27","Reserve Forces: Training","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what military training is given to new reservists, and how that training compares to military training given to new recruits to the regular forces.","false","Biography information for Lord Touhig",,"Lord Touhig","HL5550"

As a first step towards achieving this, most occupational pension schemes offering money purchase benefits are now required to report the charges levied on members and, as far as they are able, transaction costs, via an annual Chair’s Statement. The Chair’s Statement, which must be given to beneficiaries and recognised trade unions on request, must also report the trustees’ view on the extent to which these costs present value for members.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Similarly, the Financial Conduct Authority have made rules requiring Independent Governance Committees to report annually on the value for money offered by workplace personal pension schemes, taking into account scheme charges and transaction costs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government is also actively considering how to make the costs of pension schemes more visible to savers, and is committed, in line with the duties of the Pensions Act 2014, to make regulations which require information on transaction costs to be given to members and both costs and charges to be published.

We are taking a number of steps to increase their numbers further.</p><p>We are implementing a package of up to £67 million to transform mathematics and physics teaching in England. This will provide subject knowledge training to 15,000 non-specialist serving teachers and recruit up to 2,500 additional mathematics and physics teachers. The package includes programmes to encourage the brightest A level students and undergraduates into teaching; salaried part-time and abridged courses for career changers; a salaried route for post-doctoral maths and physics researchers; and support for qualified teachers wishing to return to the profession.</p><p>We have increased bursaries for science and mathematics trainee teachers; including £30,000 for physics trainees with first-class degrees. We are also offering prestigious scholarships, worth up to £30,000 for physics, and £25,000 for mathematics, chemistry and computing trainees, in partnership with the professional bodies for these subjects.</p><p>Through the School Direct route, which is specifically targeted at career changers and allows them to earn a salary whilst they train to teach, we are providing enhanced grant funding of £25,000 (up to £29,900 in inner London) to schools that pay the trainee an enhanced salary of at least £21,000 (£25,000 in inner London).</p><p>Our marketing campaign, Your Future | Their Future, includes targeted subject specific science and mathematics advertising through a range of media. Those who wish to teach secondary science or mathematics are eligible for our enhanced Premier Plus service, which provides support from a dedicated adviser to guide them through the application process. Those applicants who would benefit from it can also access funded courses to boost or refresh their subject knowledge to a level that will allow them to teach the subject.</p><p>To ensure that these teachers work in the schools where they are most needed, we have expanded school-led initial teacher training (ITT) by introducing School Direct and accrediting more school-centred initial teacher training providers. School-led ITT gives schools the leading role in responding to recruitment needs in their local area, including for science and mathematics teachers. We have also supported the growth of Teach First, a prestigious teacher training route which places trainees in some of the most deprived and challenging areas of the country. As a result of these reforms, 2015/16 is the first year in which more than half of postgraduate ITT is school-led, with 51% of trainees on a school-led route.</p><p>The National College for Teaching and Leadership has also recently changed its approach to allocating ITT places, giving individual schools and universities the freedom to recruit as many science and mathematics trainees as they need, up to the national target for each subject.</p><p>We have also recently launched the National Teaching Service (NTS). This will help schools that are finding it difficult to retain and recruit the teachers they need, such as in rural, coastal or deprived areas. We will first test aspects of the model through a pilot of 100 NTS teachers/middle leaders starting in secondary and primary schools in the North West from September 2016.
