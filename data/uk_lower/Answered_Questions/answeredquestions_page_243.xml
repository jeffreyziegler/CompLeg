This contrasts with the picture now, which shows a more targeted and intelligence led approach, with fewer searches and an arrest rate at its highest on record, standing at 16%. Additionally, HMIC has recently found that more stop and search records contain reasonable grounds for suspicion, indicating improvements in officer knowledge of the legal basis of most stop and search powers.</p><p>The latest statistics, which show that you are 3 times more likely to be stopped and searched if you are from a BAME background, and 6 times more likely if you are black, is, however, a clear indication that there is no room for complacency.
