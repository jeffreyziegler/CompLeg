"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/939890","Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","false","2018-07-17","<p>Second homes are liable for council tax, not business rates. However, where a property is available for letting commercially for short periods totalling at least 140 days per year, then it will be assessed for business rates and added to the business rates list. As of June 2018, there were 47,307 holiday lets liable for business rates in England. The table below provides the figures by local authority. Small Business Rate Relief provides 100 per cent relief from business rates on properties with a rateable value of £12,000 or less, provided the business uses only one property (though relief may still be available under certain circumstances). The Department does not hold information on the number of recipients of Small Business Rates Relief by type of property.</p><p>The 140-day rule is widely understood and provides a clear and stable method of deciding whether a property should be liable for council tax or business rates. In particular, it ensures that properties do not switch year-to-year between council tax and business rates merely due to success in letting out the property. It is right that genuine holiday lets, many of which are small businesses, should be able to apply for Small Business Rate Relief. However, the Government takes any concerns about possible council tax avoidance seriously, and is considering whether the criteria under which holiday lets are valued for business rates are appropriate.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Local authority</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Number of holiday lets on the rating list</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Adur</p></td><td><p>9</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Allerdale</p></td><td><p>1,006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Amber Valley</p></td><td><p>78</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Arun</p></td><td><p>102</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ashfield</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ashford</p></td><td><p>140</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Aylesbury Vale</p></td><td><p>21</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Babergh</p></td><td><p>118</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Barnsley</p></td><td><p>23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Barrow-in-Furness</p></td><td><p>12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basildon</p></td><td><p>12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basingstoke &amp;

Our Commitment to you for end of life care set out what everyone should expect from their care at the end of life and the actions we are taking to make high quality and personalisation a reality for all, both adults and children, and to end variation in end of life care across the health system by 2020. On 21 September 2017 we published One year on: the government response to the review of choice in end of life care, an assessment of the progress made in delivering this over the first year.

In the 2017-18 Mandate we asked for the identification of metrics to assess quality and choice in end of life care. As a result, we have in place a new indicator to measure the proportion of people with three or more emergency admissions in their final 90 days of life, which will help us assess how well patients with end of life care needs are being supported by local health and care services out of hospital and in the community.</p><p> </p><p>For 2018-19, the Government’s Mandate asks NHS England to increase the percentage of people identified as likely to be in their last year of life, so that their end of lifecare can be improved by personalising it according to their needs and preferences at an earlier stage. NHS England will use the Quality Outcomes Framework to demonstrate such an increase by looking at the percentage of people who are on the general practitioner register for supportive and palliative care, and consider expected levels based on local populations. Further work will also be undertaken to develop indicators that will enable NHS England to assess the effectiveness of local health economies in delivering choice and quality in end of life care in line with the Government’s commitment.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England knows that it can be difficult for some commissioners to develop suitable commissioning models for children with palliative and end of care needs, given the relatively small number of children concerned and their geographical spread. NHS England has established a Task and Finish Group to bring together knowledge and expertise in children’s end of life care to consider the development of commissioning models suitable for this vulnerable group of patients.

Supporting victims of domestic abuse is an absolute priority for this Government. Councils have a legal duty to provide accommodation to families and others who are vulnerable as a result of fleeing domestic abuse. The Homelessness Reduction Act requires councils to take reasonable steps for all eligible households who are homeless, to help them secure accommodation.</p><p>We are overhauling the statutory homelessness data collection alongside the introduction of the Homelessness Reduction Act. This will give us better insights into the causes of homelessness and the support people need, including where someone is accepted as homeless because they were vulnerable as a result of having fled their home because of domestic violence or the threat of domestic violence, alongside other reasons for acceptance.</p><p>We are also continuing to support the Women’s Aid Routes to Support and No Woman Turned Away projects, having already provided almost £889,000 between 2015 and 2018 for these projects. Routes to Support (formerly UK Refuges online) is part-funded by the Government and is a UK-wide online database containing information about domestic abuse and other violence against women services. No Woman Turned Away provides caseworker support to women facing difficulties in accessing refuge, including those at risk of or who have been sleeping rough or experiencing homelessness.</p><p>We have also commissioned an audit of domestic abuse service delivery - being run by Ipsos MORI – to give us a picture of provision across England, enabling us to understand what impact services are having and to identify gaps in provision.</p><p> </p><p> </p>","Selby and Ainsty","Nigel Adams",,"2018-07-17T16:34:48.613Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/939946/answer","Biography information for Nigel Adams","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/939946/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/939946/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2018-07-12","Homelessness: Domestic Abuse","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, what estimate he has made of the number of victims of domestic abuse who have (a) slept rough and (b) experienced homelessness in each of the last five years.","false","Biography information for Ms Harriet Harman","Camberwell and Peckham","Ms Harriet Harman","163484"

That’s exactly what we’re doing through the Energy Company Obligation where £450 million of the £640 million per year scheme is currently directed towards low income and vulnerable households. We recently announced that we will focus the whole of the scheme on low income and vulnerable households from later this year. We also announced that we will increase the size of ‘flexible eligibility’, which enables Local Authorities to work with partners such as the health sector to determine which households are most in need of support. In addition, initially up to 10% of the scheme will be focused on innovation, bringing forward new technology that will help tackle fuel poverty over the long term.</p><p> </p><p>In order to help low income and vulnerable households with the cost of keeping warm each winter, the Warm Home Discount provides over 2 million households with a £140 rebate off their energy bill. In addition, Winter Fuel Payments provide all pensioner households, who can be some of the most vulnerable to the impacts of living in a cold home, with a payment of between £100 and £300 each winter.</p><p> </p><p>Also, the current Safeguard Tariff caps energy prices for 4 million pre-payment meter customers, and 1 million households in receipt of the Warm Home Discount, two groups who are known to be among the most vulnerable in society.
