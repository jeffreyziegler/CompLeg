The Secretary of State announced on 4 February 2019 that, following a public consultation, the Government intends to create a reconsideration mechanism to allow for Parole Board decisions in certain circumstances to be looked at again if they appear to be fundamentally flawed. A prisoner will be able to apply for their case to be reconsidered if they think the decision was unlawful.

As a priority we must toughen security and searching to make it much more difficult for anyone to get contraband such as drugs or mobile phones into prisons. Through the Ten Prison Project we are emphasising the use of technology to search letters, bags and people. Alongside making it much harder to get contraband though the prison gate, we are also closing down other routes, such as by using netting to prevent drones and throw-overs. Improved physical security combined with good existing work on intelligence will help inform priority areas for future investment and development right across the prison estate. In the meantime, across our prisons, we have previously invested £2 million in modern technology such as handheld and portable detection devices. This was followed by another £7 million last year to enhance security in prisons through scanners, improved searching techniques and phone- blocking technology. More recently we have introduced dedicated regional search teams that can target specific individuals or parts of our estate on an intelligence-led basis and vulnerability assessments that cover gate security. We are also seeking to improve the resilience of our prisons to specific security threats through, for example, our investment in intelligence teams, a new Financial Investigations Unit, a new Serious Organised Crime Unit and the changes we are making to our dedicated counter-corruption unit as part of our new anti-corruption strategy.</p>","Penrith and The Border","Rory Stewart",,"2019-02-14T17:07:24.387Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056042/answer","Biography information for Rory Stewart","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056042/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1056042/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2019-02-06","Prisons: Security","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what steps the Government is taking to improve security in prisons.","false","Biography information for Bill Wiggin","North Herefordshire","Bill Wiggin","217501"

Schools have the freedom to use the funding to determine which activities will improve participation, especially for their least active pupils.</p><p> </p><p>The government has also utilised £100 million from the soft drinks industry levy through the healthy pupils capital fund in England to improve pupil access to facilities for physical activity, healthy eating, mental health and wellbeing, and medical conditions.</p><p>The ‘Active lives: children &amp; young people’ survey published its baseline findings in December 2018.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with the EU after Brexit. In the referendum, Northern Ireland voters voted to remain in the EU by a majority of 56% to 44%. In UK as a whole, voters voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. Northern Ireland’s constitutional framework, under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, has a distinctive cross-border dimension. Once the UK leaves the EU, the land border in Northern Ireland will change from an internal to an external EU border.

The Long Term Plan states that there are currently 110 UTCs in operation.</p><p>Services that will not become UTCs may become a general practitioner (GP) Access Hub or another non-urgent primary and community care service. Where services are closing or changing function the guidelines in planning, assuring and delivering service change, including public consultation, will be followed as necessary.</p><p>UTCs will work alongside other parts of the urgent care network and commissioners are bringing services together to be part of locally integrated urgent and emergency care services, working together with the ambulance service, NHS111, local GPs, community pharmacists and other community-based services to provide a locally accessible and convenient alternative to A&amp;E for patients who do not need to attend hospital.</p><p>The NHS Long Term Plan ensures that work, supported by £33.9 billion in cash terms (the equivalent of £20.5 billion in real terms) by 2023/24, will continue to reduce pressure on emergency hospital services, by expanding and reforming urgent and emergency care with the goal of ensuring patients get the care they need quickly, whilst relieving the pressure on A&amp;E departments.</p><p>Patients are increasingly able to access urgent care outside of hospitals through services such as improved NHS111 access, UTCs and evening and weekend GP appointments.</p><p>This year the Government provided £1.6 billion to further support the NHS, allowing it to continue treating even more patients in A&amp;E. In addition, an extra £420 million to redevelop A&amp;Es, improve emergency care and help get patients home quicker was provided in advance of the winter period.</p>",,"Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford",,"2019-02-13T17:36:25.493Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055136/answer","Biography information for Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055136/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055136/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-02-05","Accident and Emergency Departments","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to alleviate pressure on Accident and Emergency departments, including through the provision of alternative services, in the light of the closure of a number of walk-in clinics.","false","Biography information for Baroness Masham of Ilton",,"Baroness Masham of Ilton","HL13455"

In November 2017, HMRC set up a dedicated helpline for those wanting to settle their avoidance scheme use, and discuss payment options. HMRC will work with all individuals to reach a manageable and sustainable payment plan wherever possible.</p><p> </p><p>Since the announcement of the 2019 loan charge at Budget 2016, HMRC has now agreed settlements on disguised remuneration schemes with employers and individuals totalling over £1 billion. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) liabilities fall on the employer in the first instance. The charge on DR loans does not change this principle and the employee will only be liable where the amount cannot reasonably be collected from the employer, such as where the employer is offshore or no longer exists. Around 85% of the settlement yield since 2016 is from employers, with less than 15% from individuals.</p><p> </p><p>HMRC has also introduced a simplified process for those who choose to settle their use of DR avoidance schemes before the loan charge arises. DR scheme users who currently have an income of less than £50,000 and are no longer engaging in tax avoidance can automatically agree a payment plan of up to five years without the need to give HMRC any information about their income and assets. This arrangement has been extended to 7 years for scheme users who have an income of less than £30,000.</p><p> </p><p>Those who consider they need more than five (or seven) years to pay what they owe or who earn £50,000 or more should still come forward and talk to HMRC about payment terms. There are no defined minimum or maximum time periods for payment arrangements and HMRC can tailor any payment plan to their individual financial circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has introduced comprehensive double taxation provisions to ensure that no individual will pay income tax twice on the same income. More information is included in the DR Technical Note published by HMRC on 5 December 2016.

It will also provide a conduit for progress reporting and issue escalation through to both the Specialised Commissioning Oversight Group and the National Cancer Board.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England is working with NHS Digital and a small number of National Health Service providers to develop and test approaches to information governance and data sharing implications when using cloud-based technology solutions. They are also exploring options to upgrade radiotherapy planning system software to support information technology connectivity. They intend to disseminate the learning from these early test sites.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England is committed to ensuring the success of the ODNs and therefore intends to provide additional resources over and above the normal funding of radiotherapy services to support their establishment. The resources will be held by the ODN host provider who will be responsible for the programme management function, including the establishment and maintenance of a Network Oversight Group and any clinical subgroups needed to agree and implement change.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England also intends to provide addition investment in each year of the Long Term Plan to support information technology connectivity across Networks including the use of digital solutions. NHS England intends to test a number of approaches to explore the information governance and technical requirements required in the last few months of this year. This will include testing a number of models that we think will be relevant in different geographies across the country (e.g. rural, providers not on same system etc.) Specific funding will be confirmed in due course once NHS England has worked through these issues with three test sites across England.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine","217112 ; 217130","2019-02-08T12:25:37.143Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055318/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055318/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1055318/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-02-05","Radiotherapy","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what plans he has to ensure that the new radiotherapy operational delivery networks have an adequate level of IT infrastructure to work collaboratively.","false","Biography information for Grahame Morris","Easington","Grahame Morris","217113"

It will also drive the reforms that deliver a better and more sustainable NHS with improved care for patients.</p><p> </p><p>In its estimate of the funding required to deliver the NHS Long Term Plan, the Department has not assumed any change in investment after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. The NHS has confirmed the Long Term Plan is fully costed. The extra funding for the NHS will still apply in all exit scenarios in order to ensure it is there for the long term.</p><p> </p><p>The UK and EU reached an agreement to safeguard the rights of people who have built their lives in the UK and EU, following the UK’s exit from the EU. The agreement will guarantee the rights of the 167,000 EU nationals working in our health and care system. We have been working with health and social care employers across the whole of England to ensure their EU employees are aware of the straightforward and user-friendly EU settlement scheme which will allow them to secure settled status in the UK and enjoy broadly the same rights and benefits as they do now.</p><p> </p><p>The Government remains committed to leaving the EU with a deal. Under the conditions of the Withdrawal Agreement, there will be a two-year Implementation Period within which the Government will negotiate the UK’s future relationship with the EU. During the Implementation Period, there will be no change to the current trading arrangements with the EU and European Economic Area (EEA), meaning the supply of medicines and medical products will continue unhindered.</p><p> </p><p>However, as a responsible Government, we are preparing for all exit scenarios, including the possibility that the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Department is enquiring with parties across Government and industry to ensure continuity of medicines supply for patients is maintained. We asked industry to stockpile an additional six weeks’ supply of prescription-only and pharmacy medicines which come to the UK from or via the EU/EEA, over and above usual buffer stocks.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is working to ensure that there is sufficient roll-on, roll-off freight capacity to enable these vital products to continue to move freely in to the UK in a ‘no deal’ scenario. The Department is working closely with the Department for Transport to ensure all medicines and medical products are prioritised on these alternative routes to ensure that the flow of all these products will continue unimpeded after 29 March 2019.</p><p> </p><p>On 7 December 2018, the Department wrote to pharmaceutical companies that supply licensed medicines to the UK from or via the EU/EEA, and/or manufacture medicines in the UK, informing them of the updated reasonable worst-case scenario border disruption planning assumptions and asking them about their current transportation routes and their ability to re-route their supply chains if they currently rely on Dover and/or Folkestone.

As outlined in our Digital Strategy and Charter, our ambition is to ensure the UK is the best place in the world to start and grow a digital business.</p><p> </p><p>A significant part of achieving this is ensuring the wider ecosystem has the correct infrastructure for businesses to thrive. That is why the Industrial Strategy included commitments to boost spending on 5G digital connectivity right across the UK, raising investment in research and development, and improving skills by investing in maths, digital and technical education. DCMS’ Cyber Security team also supports and delivers programmes that accelerate and innovate cyber start-ups, including the NCSC Cyber Accelerator programme, and through the LORCA project - a vital step to ensure citizens and businesses can continue to operate safely online, whilst supporting UK entrepreneurs.</p><p> </p><p>We know primary barriers to growth for start-ups are having adequate access to both finance and talent. That is why for finance, Government announced a new £2.5 billion British Patient Capital programme. This is expected to attract a further £5 billion in private investment, to support UK companies with high growth potential to access the long-term investment they need to grow and go global. In addition, if in the event that the Government cannot agree on a future relationship with the European Investment Bank prior to EU Exit, we will provide the British Business Bank with £200m of additional funding in venture capital and growth finance. This will provide start-ups across the country with the initial capital they need to start their business.</p><p> </p><p>To continue to attract international talent, we have doubled the number of Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visas to 2,000. Doctors and nurses have been taken out of the Tier 2 visa cap, freeing up many more skilled worker visas to other sectors, including tech. 2019 will also see the launch of a new Start-Up visa for entrepreneurs, which will replace a route exclusively for graduates, opening it up to other talented business founders.</p><p> </p><p>In the Autumn Budget 2017 we announced investment of £21 million to expand Tech City UK into a nationwide network – Tech Nation – aimed at accelerating the growth of the digital tech sector across the country.
