However, there are significant caveats to be noted regarding the interpretation of these figures for transport spending.</p><p> </p><p>The CRA attempts to allocate expenditure on the basis of which region benefits from the spend, rather than where it is made. However, this can be challenging as expenditure in one part of the country may actually benefit a different area, and this affectsmotorways, trunk roads, and the railways. For example, whilst spending on a local hospital will predominantly benefit those who live in that area, spending on a motorway or railway line will benefit not just those living nearby but also those travelling from and to other areas across the country. Whilst the Department seeksto record rail funding across the regions based on which passengers benefit, allocations are inevitably fairly imprecise.</p><p> </p><p>Similarly, in recording spending on a per capita basis (i.e. per head of resident population), the calculation for London does not account for the large number of daily commuters, visitors and tourists who use and benefit from the roads and public transport networks, but who are not London residents. In particular, as the main international gateway into the country, London is the location for a range of transport investments which are designed to serve passengers well beyond the local resident population.</p><p> </p><p>The above caveats should be taken into account when looking at the CRA figures for regional Government expenditure on transport.

Language skills and employment skills are key, and the ability to speak English is a key enabler to successful integration. On this basis the Government provides funding for and supports English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) as part of its wider strategy to improve adult literacy in England. ESOL funding is not ring-fenced and comes out of a provider’s Adult Education Budget (AEB). Colleges and training providers have the freedom and flexibility to determine how they use their AEB to meet the needs of their communities.

Under the terms of the State Aid decision for ESN, any ESN site where EE offers a commercial service must be made available to the other UK mobile operators and interested parties to provide their own a service on an equal and non-discriminatory basis. EE has indicated that for all the sites they are building for ESN, they are providing detailed information to the mobile network operators on the locations once sites for new masts are legally acquired and planning permission has been granted. This includes additional sites that EE are funding as well as those funded by the Programme.</p><p> </p><p>For EAS sites, the principal objective is to provide coverage to meet the needs of the emergency services, but the Home Office is working with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and DCMS to identify any proposed mast locations which could improve mobile coverage in future, with a view to ensuring these are built to a specification which could accommodate multiple operators. The proposed site locations have been shared with the Scottish and Welsh Governments. Planning applications due to be submitted throughout 2017 will confirm and make public the precise locations of these sites.</p>","Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner","Mr Nick Hurd",,"2017-09-08T09:06:52.37Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/750730/answer","Biography information for Mr Nick Hurd","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/750730/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/750730/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2017-07-11","Emergency Services: Mobile Radios","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if she will publish the number of masts built using state aid that can be shared by all mobile network operators before the emergency services mobile communications programme begins.","false","Biography information for Stephen Timms","East Ham","Stephen Timms","4309"

Police and Crime Commissioners are required to hold Chief Constables to account for the delivery of the SPR and to have regard to the SPR when producing their police and crime plans.
