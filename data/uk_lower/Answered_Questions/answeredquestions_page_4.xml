Communication from Coroners can enter the Department at multiple points. There is therefore no robust central record of these contacts. To establish that we are certain we have all information to answer such questions would require a broad spectrum query to be sent out to the business.

Since the referendum over three years ago we have been meeting regularly with the egg industry to understand and anticipate the potential impacts of a no deal scenario on the sector. The UK has a high level of self-sufficiency in eggs; last year the UK was nearly 90% self-sufficient in its egg production. The UK is also a net importer of eggs, with the overwhelming majority of egg imports coming from the EU. In the event of no deal, EU imports will continue to enter the UK tariff-free. In relation to exports, last year approximately 40% of our exports of eggs (value) went to the EU. This accounts for 1.3% of our domestically produced eggs. In the event of a no deal EU departure these exports would face a tariff when going to the EU. As the UK would be classed as a ‘third country’ in the event of a no deal, there may be a period during which the UK cannot export eggs to the EU. This is because the EU may want to carry out an assessment called ‘an evaluation of equivalence’ of UK marketing standards.</p><p>We will be monitoring the market prior to and immediately after we leave the EU on 31 October and will be ready to intervene if necessary.</p>","Camborne and Redruth","George Eustice","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1151090/answer",,,,,,"2019-10-28T10:56:41.37Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1151090/answer","Biography information for George Eustice","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1151090/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-10-21","Eggs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what recent assessment she has made of the potential effect of the UK leaving the EU on the egg industry.","false","Biography information for Jane Dodds","Brecon and Radnorshire","Jane Dodds","2944"

This includes giving the police the resources and tools they need to keep families, communities and our country safe. The Government has recently launched a national campaign to begin to recruit 20,000 new police officers over the next three years, and we are making it easier for the police to use stop and search powers. Police funding is increasing by more than £1 billion this year, including council tax and additional funding through the £100 million Serious Violence Fund. This Fund covers 18 areas worst affected by serious violence and includes £63.4 million for surge operational activity, £35 million to support Violence Reduction Units, and £1.6 million to help improve the quality of data on serious violence. West Midlands PCC is receiving £7,620,000 for surge operational activity and up to £3,370,000 to support the development of their Violence Reduction Unit.</p><p>The Government is also investing over £220 million into early intervention projects to steer young people away from crime. The West Midlands PCC was awarded over £2m from the Early Intervention Youth Fund to target resources and interventions at the young people most at risk and we recently awarded over £170k from the anti-knife crime Community Fund to projects in the West Midlands. Additionally, projects in Birmingham will benefit from investment from the first allocations from the Youth Endowment Fund.</p>","North West Hampshire","Kit Malthouse","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1151113/answer",,,,,,"2019-10-29T17:51:17.673Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1151113/answer","Biography information for Kit Malthouse","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1151113/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-10-21","Crimes of Violence: Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps his Department is taking to reduce youth-related violence in Sutton Coldfield constituency.","false","Biography information for Mr Andrew Mitchell","Sutton Coldfield","Mr Andrew Mitchell","2705"

Therefore, the FCO provides Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA).

CEA is a long-standing FCO policy dating back in its current form to 1996 that provides clearly defined and limited financial support to staff to help maintain the continuity of their children's education.
