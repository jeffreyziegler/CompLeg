We are seeking to overturn the ban on new selective schools to ensure that the best and brightest students can enjoy a stretching curriculum, implementing this reform in a way that places conditions on grammar schools, as well as independent schools and universities, to ensure that they do more to raise standards across the whole system.</p><p> </p><p>Working with head teachers and other sector experts we have reformed the National Professional Qualifications to better prepare leaders for the range of roles in today’s school system and have funded the High Potential Middle Leaders and High Potential Senior Leaders programmes to develop excellent leaders in challenging schools. An independent expert group convened by the department has defined a new standard for teachers’ professional development and we have announced plans to invest around £75 million in the Teaching and Leadership Innovation Fund over the next three years to support high-quality professional development for teachers and school leaders in the areas of the country and schools that need it most.</p><p> </p><p>Our £137 million investment in the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) is expanding the evidence base on what works to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils. As part of its dissemination activity the EEF, in partnership with the Institute for Effective Education, has established a network of Research Schools to support the use of evidence in improving teaching practice.</p><p> </p><p>Reforms brought in by the Children and Families Act 2014 are transforming the support available to children and young people with SEN and disabilities (SEND) by joining up services for 0-25 year olds across education, health and social care and by focusing on positive outcomes for education, employment, housing, health and community participation. Building on effective practice to support disadvantaged pupils we have funded the development of the SEND Review, based on the model of the Pupil Premium Review, to support SEND focussed school-to-school improvement. Since 2015, we have funded the Whole School SEND consortium to embed the SEND review nationally and encourage school leaders to give greater priority to improving their SEND provision.</p><p> </p><p>Schools have a clear legal duty not to discriminate against pupils under the Equality Act 2010. Statutory guidance on exclusions is clear that head teachers should make additional efforts to consider what extra support is needed to avoid exclusion for groups with disproportionately high rates of exclusion, including those with SEND and pupils from Gypsy Roma Traveller communities. Our plans to reform the use of alternative provision (AP) include making schools accountable for the ongoing education and outcomes of pupils who require AP, such as those who are permanently excluded. This will further strengthen incentives for schools to take earlier action where problems emerge that put pupils at risk of exclusion.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson",,"2017-04-24T14:32:48.963Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/720414/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/720414/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/720414/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2017-04-13","Children: Poverty","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to page 123 of the report, UK Poverty: Causes and Solutions, published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on 6 September 2016, if she will make an assessment of the potential merits of implementing the recommendations in that report on providing all children with an excellent education.","false","Biography information for Lyn Brown","West Ham","Lyn Brown","70976"

However, we should be mindful that this is the third year that the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) have taken the lead for security since the closure of the International Security Assistance Force combat mission. The ANDSF continue to improve under difficult security circumstances, supported by mentors from NATO's Resolute Support (RS) mission. The Taliban continue to test the ANDSF, particularly in rural areas and occasionally threaten some provincial capitals, but the ANDSF have shown professionalism and resilience in managing security and countering terrorism, including from Daesh's affiliate in the region.</p><p>Along with international partners, the UK is committed to helping Afghanistan to build a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. At the Warsaw Summit in July 2016, NATO agreed to sustain the non-combat Train, Advise and Assist RS mission through 2017. We have increased the UK forces under RS command to a total of 500.

As employers across the NHS are responsible for the morale of their staff, the main function of the NHS Staff Survey is to help trusts benchmark their performance against peers to inform plans for improving their staff’s experience of working for the NHS. According to the latest (2016) NHS Staff Survey, staff engagement has risen to its highest level, 3.79/5 up from 3.68 when it was first recorded in 2012. Across the 32 key measures, over 80% were more positive than last year. 90% of NHS staff report their organisation takes positive action on staff health and well-being.</p><p> </p><p>However, there is no room for complacency. Engagement scores ranging from acute specialist trusts at 3.94 to ambulance trusts at 3.43.</p><p> </p><p>The Department, therefore, continues to commission NHS Employers to support trusts in improving staff experience (covering staff engagement, health and wellbeing)<sup>2</sup> through advice, guidance and good practice including, for example, NHS Employers staff engagement resource library<sup>3</sup>. NHS Employers is also working with NHS England and Public Health England on NHS England’s initiative<sup>4</sup> to improve staff health and wellbeing which includes a “CQUIN”<sup>5</sup> (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) incentive payment for trusts to focus on getting staff better access to health and wellbeing initiatives, supporting them to make healthy choices and lead healthy lives.</p><p> </p><p>The NHS Social Partnership Forum which includes the Department, unions and employers, is supporting efforts to improve NHS staff morale having launched its “call to action”<sup>6</sup> to NHS bodies to tackle high levels of bullying and harassment. Drawing on evidence and frontline experiences, this initiative includes resources, advice and good practice to help organisations develop local plans.</p><p> </p><p>Notes:</p><p>1 <a href="http://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/Page/1056/Home/NHS-Staff-Survey-2016/" target="_blank">http://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/Page/1056/Home/NHS-Staff-Survey-2016/</a></p><p>2 <a href="http://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/retain-and-improve/staff-experience" target="_blank">http://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/retain-and-improve/staff-experience</a></p><p>3 <a href="http://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/retain-and-improve/staff-experience/staff-engagement/staff-engagement-resource-library" target="_blank">http://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/retain-and-improve/staff-experience/staff-engagement/staff-engagement-resource-library</a></p><p>4 <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2015/09/improving-staff-health/" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/2015/09/improving-staff-health/</a></p><p>5 <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cquin-guidance-16-17-v3.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cquin-guidance-16-17-v3.pdf</a></p><p>6 <a href="http://www.socialpartnershipforum.org/4573" target="_blank">http://www.socialpartnershipforum.org/4573</a></p>","Ludlow","Mr Philip Dunne",,"2017-04-25T14:24:54.03Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/720537/answer","Biography information for Mr Philip Dunne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/720537/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/720537/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-04-13","NHS: Job Satisfaction","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what recent assessment he has made of trends in the level of morale in the NHS workforce; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Grahame Morris","Easington","Grahame Morris","70693"

All asylum and human rights claims are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with the UK’s obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, the Home Office expects unsuccessful asylum seekers to return voluntarily to their home country. The Home Office can assist persons who wish to return voluntarily. The Home Office’s preferred option is for those who have no legal basis to remain in the UK to leave voluntarily and we offer assistance to those who choose to do so by actively promoting the Home Office Voluntary Return Service. This service offers confidential advice and information to asylum seekers, refugees and people who have remained in the UK without legal status and should return home on a voluntary basis. Individuals who fall within the above categories can obtain further advice by telephoning: 0300 004 0202 or by accessing the website at: <a href="http://www.gov.uk/return-home-voluntarily" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/return-home-voluntarily</a></p><p>If an individual does not leave the UK voluntarily, then it may become necessary to enforce their removal. The Home Office closely monitors developments in all countries of return and takes decisions on a case-by-case basis in the light of international obligations and the latest available country information. The Home Office only enforces removal when it and the courts conclude that it is safe to do so, with a safe route of return.</p><p>Enforced removals are carried out in the most sensitive way possible, treating those being removed with respect and courtesy.

In April 2013, the UK introduced Immigration Rules to allow stateless persons to be formally recognised as stateless and granted leave to remain where they do not otherwise qualify under any other provisions and cannot be removed to the country of their former habitual residence because they are not admissible for purposes of residence there. Those who have committed serious crimes or are considered to be a danger to the security or the public order of the UK are not eligible for stateless leave. Those who qualify under the Immigration Rules are normally granted 30 months limited leave to remain and can apply for further leave when that expires. They are eligible to apply for settlement after completing 5 years limited leave.</p><p>Stateless persons and their dependent children, who believe that they have a fear of return to their home country, can also make an application for asylum under the 1951 Refugee Convention. Those who qualify under the Immigration Rules are normally granted limited leave to remain for a 5 year period, with the option to apply for settlement when that leave expires. A stateless person may also make an application to register as a British citizen, if they are not recognised as a citizen of any country, providing they meet the qualifying criteria.</p><p>The Home Office shares information with UNHCR relating to statelessness.
