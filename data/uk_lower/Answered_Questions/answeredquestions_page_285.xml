Provisions in the Act make it easier to prosecute an employer who knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, that the person they employ has no permission to work in the UK and this is accompanied by an increase in the maximum custodial sentence from 2 to 5 years. Rogue employers could also have their businesses closed if they continue to flout the law, and licences in the private hire vehicle and taxi sector and alcohol and late night refreshment sector will be subject to immigration checks and continuing compliance with immigration laws.</p><p>It would not be a proportionate response to name and prosecute every employer who employs an illegal worker.
