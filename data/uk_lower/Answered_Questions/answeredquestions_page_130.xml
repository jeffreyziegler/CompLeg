Bradford4Teaching is the city’s innovative campaign to attract the best teachers to live, work and build a career in Bradford.

The Department is also committing an additional £1.5 million to support school improvement in Bradford’s most challenging schools through the OA programme. In total, as part of the OA programme, we are spending £72 million across 12 areas of the country facing challenges and Bradford will benefit from a share of that.</li><li>The regional academy growth fund supports successful trusts to grow and to improve standards in underperforming schools. Schools in Bradford that are underperforming have already benefited from this funding.</li><li>Through the Strategic School Improvement Fund, five applicants are supporting a total of 43 schools in Bradford.

However, once the pupil has been admitted to the school sixth form, it is unlawful to exclude them for any reason other than discipline.

We have extended funding for the FDAC National Unit four times since the period 2015 to 2016.</p><p>Most recently, we committed to providing funding to the NHS trust to the end of September 2018 to support its application to the government’s Life Chances Fund (LCF). The trust’s application to the LCF had two aims. The first aim was to develop a social impact bond model of funding for local FDACs. The second aim was to develop a sustainable way to fund the FDAC National Unit. Unfortunately, the trust recently decided to withdraw their application to the LCF. We understand that this means that the trust is considering the future of the FDAC National Unit, including its potential closure. Officials are working with the trust to ensure that the impact of the potential closure of the FDAC National Unit on local sites is minimised and that any resources developed by the FDAC National Unit remains accessible in the future to the trust and others interested in the FDAC model..</p><p>In relation to the effectiveness of FDACs, the Department of Education has, under the Children’s Social Care Innovation Programme, funded a continuation study[1] (published in December 2016) which looked at the outcomes of FDAC cases five years after the original evaluation of the London Family Drug and Alcohol Court study.</p><p>Data, on the number of cases that have been heard by each FDAC court since its inception, is collected and retained by local authorities who are responsible for setting up, managing and supporting local FDACs around the country, as part of their child protection and care proceedings work. The government does not collect such data.</p><p>The government is committed to finding effective approaches to spreading innovative, evidence-based models of practice to local areas.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>[1] Harwin J, Alrouh B, Ryan M, McQuarrie T, Golding L, Broadhurst K, Tunnard J and Swift S (December 2016) ‘After FDAC: outcomes 5 years later.

These considerations are a central part of our planning and campaign assessment processes.

As of 28 June 2018 over 336,000 applications have been made for Tax-Free Childcare and of these 313,000 been found eligible for the scheme. As of the 31 May 2018 over 74,000 families have paid money into their Tax-Free Childcare accounts and received the government top up.</p><p> </p><p>The main eligibility criteria for Tax-Free Childcare and 30 hours free childcare have not changed since they were introduced. To help parents to return to work we have allowed parents to apply for 30 hours free childcare and Tax-Free Childcare 31 days, rather than 14, before returning to, or starting to, work.</p><p> </p><p>Additionally, from September 2018, we have extended 30 hours free childcare to foster children, where their foster parents work outside fostering. To receive 30 hours free childcare it must be consistent with the child’s care plan.</p><p> </p><p>There have been no policy changes to 15 hours free childcare for 3 and 4 year olds since the policy was introduced.</p><p> </p><p>In September 2013, the government introduced 15 hours of early education for two-year-olds who are entitled to free school meals. From September 2014, this was extended to children whose families receive Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross household income of less than £16,190. This was so that children of low income working families, as well as those not in work, would benefit from 15 hours of early education. From 1 April 2018 the Government introduced a net earnings threshold equivalent to £15,400 for families on Universal Credit.</p><p> </p><p>The limited tax exemption for childcare vouchers which took effect from 6 April 2005 has been subject to a number of minor technical changes which can affect eligibility. These have mostly been in relation to changes in tax credit regulations and changes to the definition of disabled children in legislation.</p><p> </p><p>For question 158283 relating to childcare vouchers HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) does not hold this information.</p><p> </p><p>I refer the Honourable member to my statement made on 29 March 2018 which sets out the reasons childcare vouchers are closing to new entrants from 4 October 2018 - <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statements/?page=1&amp;max=20&amp;questiontype=AllQuestions&amp;house=commons%2clords&amp;member=4097" target="_blank">www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statements/?page=1&amp;max=20&amp;questiontype=AllQuestions&amp;house=commons%2clords&amp;member=4097</a></p><p> </p><p>Data on the income profile of recipients of Tax-Free Childcare and 30 hours free childcare can only be generated at disproportionate cost. It is not possible to estimate the income distribution of families benefiting from 15 hours of early education for 3 and 4 year olds as this is a universal offer. All recipients of 15 hours early education for 2 year olds earn less than £16,190. The distribution of childcare voucher recipients by annual income for the year 2017-18 is estimated to be as follows: 54% with income of under £45,000, 46% with income in excess of £45,000.
