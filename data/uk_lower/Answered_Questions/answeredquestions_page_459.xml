GPs are able to access these tests directly in cases where the two-week urgent referral pathway is not appropriate but a patient’s symptoms require further investigation.

The breast cancer campaign from February to March 2014 was specifically aimed at women over 70 as there is considerable evidence that many older women are not aware that they are still at risk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2012, to increase the awareness of cancer amongst GPs and support GPs to assess all patients more effectively, the Department funded the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Learning to provide an e-learning tool for GPs. The modules include tackling late diagnosis; risk assessment tools; and cancer pathway and the role of primary care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2013, Macmillan Cancer Support, partly funded by the Department, piloted an electronic cancer decision support tool for GPs to use in their routine practice. Following the pilot, Macmillan is now offering the tool free of charge to all GPs in the United Kingdom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is in the process of updating the Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer (2005) to ensure that it reflects latest evidence and can continue to support GPs to identify patients with the symptoms of suspected cancer and urgently refer them as appropriate. NICE’s draft is currently out for consultation until 9 January 2015. The anticipated publication date for the revised guidelines is May 2015.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Men and women aged 75 and over are able to self-refer for bowel screening every two years if they wish. Women over 70 are able to self-refer every three years for breast screening.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Finally, NHS England in their recent publication ‘Five Year Forward View’ (October 2014) acknowledge that cancer survival is below the European average, especially for people aged over 75. The report highlights that improvements in outcomes will require action on better prevention; swifter access to diagnosis, and better treatment and care for all those diagnosed with cancer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/165985/answer",,,,,,"2014-11-28T12:20:57.87Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/165985/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/165985/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-11-25","Cancer: Older People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps (a) his Department and (b) NHS England are taking to improve early diagnosis of cancer for patients aged over 75.","false","Biography information for Nic Dakin","Scunthorpe","Nic Dakin","215939"

Translarna is an orphan medicinal product that is used to treat patients aged five years and older with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are able to walk. Translarna is expected to slow down the loss of walking ability in DMD patients. As part of the conditional marketing authorisation, the company will be required to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy of Translarna from an ongoing confirmatory study.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rare diseases are classified as conditions affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people in European Union and patients with rare conditions deserve the same quality, safety and efficacy in medicines as other patients with more common conditions. Since the pharmaceutical industry has little interest, under normal market conditions, in developing and marketing medicines intended for small numbers of patients (orphan medicinal products), the European Union offers a range of incentives to encourage the development of these medicines in order to address the unmet clinical need (orphan drug legislation, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000). These incentives include a period of 10 years market exclusivity, the provision of Protocol Assistance (scientific advice specifically tailored for orphan medicinal products) and fee reductions and waivers for regulatory procedures. Products intended for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy qualify for incentives in the orphan drug legislation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Applications for the designation of orphan medicines are reviewed by the European Medicines Agency through the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). For orphan designation, the following criteria must be fulfilled. The medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union or without incentives it is unlikely that expected sales of the medicinal product would cover the investment in its development and no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned is authorised, or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Via the MHRA, the United Kingdom takes an active role in the decision making process at the COMP, ensuring applications for Orphan Drug designation of potential drug candidates for rare diseases are appropriately recognised, encouraging companies to develop their products further. For licensing, it is compulsory for designated orphan medicinal products to use the centralised procedure to gain a marketing authorisation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The UK is fully represented at the Committee on Human Medicinal Products, ensuring that applications for a Marketing Authorisation (MA) for an Orphan Drug are thoroughly and rapidly evaluated for quality, safety and efficacy and a MA is granted without undue delay for the treatment of rare diseases.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In some circumstances, marketing authorisations may undergo a more rapid regulatory review called ‘accelerated assessment’. This occurs where the Applicant can demonstrate that the medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest (particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation). For drugs for rare diseases, marketing authorisation applications may be granted as a conditional authorisation or an authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The granting of a conditional marketing authorisation allow medicines to reach patients with unmet medical needs earlier than might otherwise be the case, and ensures that additional data on a product are generated, submitted, assessed and acted upon. Under exceptional circumstances, the MA Applicant must demonstrate that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because, for example, the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NHS England can confirm that a draft clinical commissioning policy for Translarna treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been developed and is being considered as part of the annual funding prioritisation process for 2015-16.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p>","Mid Norfolk","George Freeman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/165999/answer",,,,,,"2014-11-28T12:12:23.72Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/165999/answer","Biography information for George Freeman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/165999/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-11-25","Muscular Dystrophy: Drugs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps he is taking to ensure that emerging treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy which receive conditional approval are available through the Early Access to Medicines Scheme as early as possible; what steps he is taking to encourage flexible approaches to the licensing process for potential new treatments for rare conditions; what progress NHS England has made on development of a commissioning policy for the Translarna treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Dr Julian Huppert","Cambridge","Dr Julian Huppert","215820"
