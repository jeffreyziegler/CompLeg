These measures include an asset freeze, travel ban and an extensive embargo which prohibits the export of arms, dual-use goods, and luxury goods and imposes restrictions on the export of other listed items which could contribute to nuclear or ballistic missile programmes. All export licence applications are assessed against the consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, considering the prevailing circumstances at the time of the application, including the capabilities of the equipment, and the end user. A licence would not be granted if to do so would be a breach of our international obligations or we assessed there was an unacceptable risk of diversion to a WMD programme or to a military programme in an embargoed destination. However, it is impossible to completely prevent non-listed items manufactured in the UK being used in North Korean produced weapons, for example if items are legitimately exported from the UK to third countries but are subsequently sold to entities in the DPRK. For this reason the UK is also active in encouraging other countries to enforce DPRK sanctions more effectively.

It has security, political and humanitarian dimensions.

In Syria, we support military action by the US and five Arab states against ISIL; we are supporting the Syrian moderate opposition, who are fighting ISIL; and we continue to work for a political transition: when it comes to tackling ISIL, Assad is part of the problem, not part of the solution. In Lebanon, we continue to press for the election of a President, strengthen municipalities and support the Lebanese Armed Forces reassert state authority in their border regions On the humanitarian front, we continue to provide swift and substantial assistance to those who have fled areas controlled by ISIL, including air drops to deliver aid to those trapped by ISIL.

Interested parties have a statutory right to make representations on planning appeals, and these representations are required to be taken into account by the decision maker. This allows proper democratic oversight of the appeals process.</p><p> </p><p>The Localism Act 2011 has strengthened the role of Local Plans and abolished the last Administration’s top-down Regional Strategies. Our streamlined National Planning Policy Framework strongly encourages areas to get up-to-date Local Plans in place, and we have been actively supporting councils in doing so. Local Plans now set the framework in which decisions on particular applications are taken, whether locally or at appeal, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>Once made a neighbourhood plan will also become part of the area’s statutory development plan — an example of this Government’s localist agenda. Both Local and Neighbourhood Plans are founded on thorough community involvement and are subject to independent examination and consultation. Over 1,200 communities have applied for a neighbourhood planning area to be designated, with over 1,000 areas now designated.</p><p> </p><p>Planning inspectors will take full account of all the evidence that is before them, including representations made by local residents and other interested parties. Each representation should be considered on their merits, paying careful regard to the relevant policy and material planning considerations.</p><p> </p><p>Since the National Planning Policy Framework was introduced, the number of appeals received has fallen as has the number allowed. The quality of local decisions also remains high—99% of decisions are made locally with only approximately 1% of planning applications overturned on appeal. Housing starts and housing construction are also up, as are permissions for new homes. This means there is more local decision-making, and our reforms are supporting badly-needed new homes within a locally-led planning system.</p>","Great Yarmouth","Brandon Lewis",,"2014-10-20T16:08:14.4302812Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93479/answer","Biography information for Brandon Lewis","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93479/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/93479/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2014-10-15","Planning Permission: Appeals","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what assessment he has made of the adequacy of democratic oversight of local planning decisions when appealed; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Chi Onwurah","Newcastle upon Tyne Central","Chi Onwurah","210798"
