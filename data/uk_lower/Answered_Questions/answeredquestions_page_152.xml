It aims to provide guidance on the selection and use of risk assessment tools in the care of adults at risk of fragility fractures in all National Health Service settings. The guidance recommends that clinicians consider assessment of fracture risk in all women aged 65 years and over and all men aged 75 years and over. Women aged less than 65 years and men aged less than 75 years should be considered for assessment in the presence of certain risk factors, such as a family history of hip fracture or low body mass index. The guidance can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg146" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg146</a></p><p> </p><p>There are a number of therapies and treatments available for the prevention of fragility fractures in people who are assessed as being at risk, or to prevent further fractures in those who have already had one or more fragility fractures. Drugs available to help maintain bone density include: bone sparing agents, such as bisphosphonates; calcium and vitamin D supplements; and certain hormone based treatments.</p><p> </p><p>Locally commissioned fracture liaison services (FLS) can also play a key role in reducing the risk of fracture in patients. These services systematically and proactively identify patients in secondary and/or primary care who have suffered a fragility fracture and assess the patient’s risk of future fragility fracture in a timely fashion. FLS then provide advice and/or therapy to reduce that risk. There is good evidence that these services are cost-effective and can result in a reduction in the incidence of fragility fractures in the local population. NHS England has developed a Falls and Fragility Fractures Pathway in partnership with Public Health England and the National Osteoporosis Society, as part of its Rightcare programme. Rightcare highlights the high value interventions that systems should focus on to address variation, improve outcomes, reduce cost and contribute toward a sustainable NHS.

A copy of this report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 19 December 2017.</p><p> </p><p>The 16 - 18 Bursary Fund provides financial help to young people in further education who need help with costs such as travel and essential course equipment. Annual bursaries of up to £1,200 are available to vulnerable students such as those in care, care leavers and those receiving certain income or disability benefits in their own right. £130 million was allocated for discretionary bursaries to institutions in 2017 to 2018. A further £34 million was allocated in 2017 to 2018 for free meals.</p><p> </p><p>Changes to the student finance system have allowed more 18 year olds to enter higher education than ever before, including the highest ever number from disadvantaged backgrounds. Students from the lowest-income households starting their courses in 2018 to 2019 will have access to the largest ever amounts of cash-in-hand support for their living costs. Support for living costs increased by 10.3% for eligible students on the lowest incomes in 2016 to 2017 compared with the previous system, with further increases of 2.8 per cent for the current academic year. The government has announced a further 3.2 per cent increase in 2018 to 2019.</p><p> </p><p>A young person on an apprenticeship will receive at least the national minimum wage, which increased to £3.70 per hour in April 2018. The Apprenticeship Pay Survey 2016 estimates that the average gross hourly pay for apprentices in England was £6.70 an hour for level 2 and 3 apprentices and £9.83 for higher level apprenticeships.</p><p> </p><p>For apprentices claiming benefits in their own right, financial support is available for those on low incomes. Young people may be able to claim Universal Credit or Tax Credits to help with living costs. Universal Credit is also an in-work benefit, so young claimants in work on low wages, including apprentices under contract, can continue to claim housing support.</p><p> </p><p>Delivering more, better quality apprenticeships will make sure that more people from lower socio-economic backgrounds can gain the skills and training they need to build successful careers.
