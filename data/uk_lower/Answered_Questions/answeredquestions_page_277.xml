This requires importers bringing firewood into England and Scotland from outside the UK to provide the Forestry Commission with at least three days’ prior notification of its arrival if it is coming by sea, road or rail, and four hours’ notice if arriving by air. The Welsh Assembly Government is expected to introduce a similar regulation.</p><p> </p><p>The scheme will enable the Forestry Commission to gather information about the firewood importing trade, and to carry out risk-based and random inspections of a selection of imports.

These include a current project in Uganda looking at how gorilla-based tourism generates increased benefits for poor people living around Bwindi Forest, improving local support for the park and for conservation of gorillas. Another project worked with local communities in Madagascar to reduce hunting of lemurs.</p><p>Defra has also funded Darwin projects on sustainable forest management, to improve the natural habitat for many primates, including a current project in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, Peru showing how rainforest regeneration can deliver high priority biodiversity conservation as well as enhanced livelihoods for local communities.</p><p>The primate study also identified the illegal trade of primates as one of the drivers to their extinction. The UK remains committed to playing a leading role in tackling illegal wildlife trade (IWT) and working with our international partners to bring about its end. In the run-up to the Hanoi IWT conference in November 2016, the UK Government ran an online campaign to raise awareness of the threat of IWT, highlighting the damage it does globally, that it is moving many species towards extinction, and alerting the public to the fact that it is a crime.

MHRA has fully implemented the recommendations of the review to update the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet with strengthened warnings and to provide educational materials in the form of booklets aimed at ensuring prescribers and patients have the information they need to make an informed choice. The outcome of the EMA review was communicated in a letter to healthcare professionals accompanied by a guide for healthcare professionals and a booklet for patients in January 2015 through the Central Alerting System (a web based cascade system for issuing alerts to the National Health Service) and the MHRA’s Drug Safety Update bulletin.</p><p> </p><p>MHRA has, in addition, worked with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and patient groups to expand on the educational materials agreed by the EMA review and has developed a valproate toolkit which comprises booklets for healthcare professionals and a checklist for prescribers, a reminder card to be provided by pharmacists to patients when the product is dispensed, a guide for women and clear package labelling carrying a prominent warning about use in pregnancy. It was widely disseminated to relevant healthcare professionals from February 2016 including through the Central Alerting System and the MHRA’s Drug Safety Update bulletin and in hard copy from the marketing authorisation holders. Electronic copies of the toolkit are hosted on several websites including the Electronic Medicines Compendium.</p><p> </p><p>In order to monitor the effectiveness of the valproate toolkit, the MHRA continues to work with all stakeholders to gather feedback that demonstrates the toolkit materials are being used. This includes working with voluntary organisations and patient groups to produce online patient surveys to measure awareness of the risks among patients. Furthermore, MHRA is conducting a study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to track changes in prescribing of valproate to women and girls following the communications to healthcare professionals and patients on the risks of valproate in pregnancy. The marketing authorisation holder is conducting Europe-wide studies to measure the changes in patterns of prescribing and the awareness of healthcare professionals of the risks. The available data will be brought together in a regularly updated dashboard that will be used to track the impact of the communications on patient and professional awareness over time.</p>","Oxford West and Abingdon","Nicola Blackwood",,"2017-01-26T17:43:34.313Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/677526/answer","Biography information for Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/677526/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/677526/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-01-23","Sodium Valproate","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, when he plans to implement in full the recommendations of European Medicines Agency's review into sodium valproate.","false","Biography information for Alison Thewliss","Glasgow Central","Alison Thewliss","61239"
