The safety net is designed to increase their ability to deal with weather induced shocks. This approach has helped to reduce food stress for 10 million people.</li><li>The Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) programme aims to benefit 5 million vulnerable people, especially women and children, in 13 developing countries. It will help them become more resilient to climate extremes and disasters, while gathering knowledge on how to avoid humanitarian disasters arising from climate extremes.</li><li>In Kenya, DFID supported the Arid Lands Support Programme (ASP) to support the resilience of some 475,000 people. The programme included: the expansion of a pilot Index Based Livestock Insurance mechanism for poor pastoralists; improved fodder production and storage; and the building of community assets, such as water storage”.</li></ul><p>More recently, the UK’s new Humanitarian policy aims to build on the commitments made at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, including the Grand Bargain.
