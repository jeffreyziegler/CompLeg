The DfE has provided £22 million through the Service Pupil Premium to support over 73,000 children from Service families in state schools in England. At official level the MOD works closely and routinely with DfE (and Devolved equivalents) to ensure that Service pupils suffer no disadvantage in comparison with their non-Service peers.</p><p>DfE conducted a thorough analysis of the educational attainment of Service pupils at state schools in England in 2010, and levels of attainment continue to be monitored through joint working between the DfE and the MOD's Directorate, Children and Young People. The Service Children in State Schools Network provides vital support and advice for state schools in England, and both the DfE and the MOD sit on the Executive Board. In addition DfE have a permanent seat on the MOD's Children and Young People Board, which is currently chaired by Lieutenant General James Bashall.</p><p>For full details of the close working relationship that the MOD and the DfE have on this issue, I refer the hon.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/626630","Department of Health","false","2016-11-04","<p>With regard to general practice, NHS England is promoting the use of online booking and cancellation of appointments. Evidence shows that patients are more likely to cancel an appointment which is no longer needed, if the appointment was booked online. Furthermore, some general practitioner (GP) surgeries display information about lost clinic time potentially resulting from cancelled appointments which cannot be re-filled or from patients not attending appointments without any prior notification. The Department does not collect information on the number of missed and cancelled GP appointments.</p><p> </p><p>With regard to acute services, the NHS Constitution emphasises patients’ responsibilities to the National Health Service, including that they “should keep appointments, or cancel within reasonable time”. It is the responsibility of NHS organisations locally to plan for and take action to minimise the number of patients who fail to attend their appointments, for example, by reminding patients of their forthcoming appointments through the use of text message reminder systems. NHS England publishes quarterly data on hospital outpatient appointments. The proportion of hospital outpatient appointments that patients did not attend has fallen from 10.6% in 2008-09 to 8.9% in 2015-16.</p>","Warrington South","David Mowat",,"2016-11-04T14:39:20.667Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/626630/answer","Biography information for David Mowat","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/626630/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/626630/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-11-01","Out-patients: Attendance","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what recent steps his Department has taken to ensure patients attend (a) GP and (b) acute services appointments.","false","Biography information for Karen Lumley","Redditch","Karen Lumley","51300"

This figure is set to increase to around 18 million by 2025.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, between 60% and 70% of the total health and care spend in England is associated with caring for people with LTCs. The annual health and social care cost per person per year for a person without an LTC is £1,000, this rises to £3,000 for those with one LTC, and £8,000 for those with three. The additional cost to the NHS and social care for the increase in co-morbidities is likely to be £5 billion in 2018 compared to 2011.

However, access to Quality Premium scheme funding, which CCGs can earn in addition to their normal allocations for achieving specific improvements in care or outcomes, is partially dependent on each CCG’s performance against waiting times standards. More broadly, NHS England is supported by legislation in exercising formal powers of direction if it is satisfied that a CCG is failing or at risk of failing to discharge its functions. The NHS Standard Contract provides for financial sanctions against acute hospital trusts for breaching waiting time operational standards.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England issues planning guidance annually, the latest of which is<em> NHS Operational Planning and Contracting Guidance 2017-2019</em>. This sets out the waiting time standards, other operational standards and quality requirements that providers of NHS healthcare services are expected to meet in order to deliver the rights and pledges in the NHS Constitution. Copies of the Guidance and the NHS Constitution are attached.</p><p> </p><p>These requirements are set out in the NHS Standard Contract that must be used by CCGs for all contracts with hospital providers of NHS healthcare services. The Contract sets out the consequences of breaches of the waiting time standards and other requirements by hospital providers. For waiting time standards, this consequence is in the form of a financial sanction.</p><p> </p><p>However, from 2016-17, the operation of contractual sanctions for poor performance against waiting time standards has been suspended where a hospital provider is receiving funding from the Sustainability and Transformation Fund (STF), and meets certain other specified conditions, including the agreement of performance trajectories with NHS Improvement and NHS England. These arrangements are arranged at avoiding ‘double jeopardy’ for hospital providers within scope of the STF.
