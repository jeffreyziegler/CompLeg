They also affect the climate through their impact upon cloud formation and upon the reflectance of the Earth’s surface. These effects make the overall impact of black carbon on the climate less certain.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report in 2013 showed that soot ranks third behind carbon dioxide and methane as a climate warming agent, excluding its influence on clouds. Recent work by the Hadley Centre found that the elimination of soot emissions between 2010 and 2100 could lead to an approximately 0.15 degree centigrade decrease in global mean surface temperature. However, as several measures that reduce black carbon emissions also reduce other emissions of cooling pollutants such as sulphate and brown carbon it may not be technically possible to realise this benefit in full, even if measures could be fully deployed globally.</p><p>The government is taking a number of actions to reduce emissions fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) for air quality and health reasons which will lead to decreases in emissions of black carbon and reduce wasted energy resources. These include measures to reduce vehicle particle emissions, increasing the efficiency of wood burning stoves through product standards and raising awareness of the benefits of using quality fuel and the implementation of the Non Road Mobile Machinery Regulations.</p><p>Other short lived climate pollutants include methane and tropospheric ozone. Reductions of emissions of methane and precursors of ozone are occurring through measures on vehicle and combustion plant emissions and through the natural gas mains replacement programme. In the longer term we have agreed, in the revised Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, stringent emission ceilings which constrain total UK emissions of fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and oxides of nitrogen from 2020 onwards.

Its most recent campaign led up to the voter registration deadline ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly election scheduled for Thursday 2 March.</p><p>Online advertising is one of several channels used by the Commission and includes a number of elements, including ‘display’ advertising, whereby the Commission’s voter registration advertising appears on a wide range of websites, including various news media outlets, which voters are likely to visit for information on elections or about political interests. In order to achieve a breadth of coverage, the Commission often use the Google Display Network (GDN) which is a system run by Google that enables advertisers to place online banner ads across a wide range of news, blogs and other websites, and is a commonly used method for publicly-funded campaigns. They brief media buying agencies to purchase space on the GDN based on the audiences they want to reach. The algorithms that sit behind the GDN will automatically identify the most appropriate websites for ads to appear on, based on the audience visiting those sites. This is a cost-effective way to purchase advertising space and to ensure that a diversity of voters see messages multiple times – ads for the campaign in Northern Ireland appeared on more than 5,000 websites.</p><p>Historical data on individual website spending for all previous campaigns within the last three years is not held by the Commission. However, the Commission can confirm that as part of the recent campaign in Northern Ireland, the Commission’s spend relating to Breitbart News totals £19.51. This equates to 0.7% of the Commission’s overall advertising spend with the GDN in that campaign, and a total media budget for the campaign of £140,000 which included TV, press, billboard, radio and social media advertising.</p>","Houghton and Sunderland South","Bridget Phillipson",,"2017-03-01T17:38:39.643Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/694271/answer","Biography information for Bridget Phillipson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/694271/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/694271/answer",,,,,"36","Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission","Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission","2017-02-24","Electoral Commission: Advertising","1","House of Commons","To ask the hon.

As such, schools do not need to obtain parental or pupil consent to the provision of information and they are protected from any legal challenge that they are breaching a duty of confidence to pupils. Likewise the Department for Education does not need consent to share the data with named bodies or third parties as long as that sharing is lawful and in compliance with the Data Protection Act.</p><p>Whilst the legislative background removes those needs, DfE takes the rights of data subjects very seriously and seeks to ensure all data subjects are aware of what data is used for what purposes. Aligned with the Data Protection Act 1998, DfE focuses on ensuring data subjects know:</p><ul><li>the right to know the types of data being held</li></ul><ul><li>why it is being held, and</li><li>to whom it may be communicated.</li></ul><p>A ‘privacy notice’ is a good way to be able to meet data subjects’ rights and DfE strongly recommend that these are used by all schools to explain what personal data they collect, why it is collected, who it is shared with and what it is used for. To support schools with using privacy notices in this way the Department have developed a privacy notice template, which is available for schools to use on GOV.UK, which gives access to further information about the Department's use of personalised data.</p><p>To maintain public transparency about the uses made of information held by the Department, we also publish a list of 3rd party uses of the National Pupil Database (NPD) that details which organisations have received NPD data, along with an outline of what the data is being used for.

The National Intelligence Unit (NIU) ensures that intelligence is being gathered, interrogated and fully exploited across prisons and probation. The NIU have developed products specifically designed to combat the threat of psychoactive substances within prisons. All Units work with prisons, probation and law enforcement partners to develop intelligence on offenders who present the greatest threat to prison security – which includes those involved in the supply of drugs. The London and Thames Valley regional unit provides support to both Pentonville and Wormwood Scrubs to pursue those involved in the distribution of drugs and disrupt their activity within prisons. The work within our regional units has already started to pay dividends as disruption activity resulting from intelligence provided has taken place.</p><p> </p><p>This work is supported by a protocol with the National Police Chiefs Council for the mandatory referral of all potential cases of conveyance, supply, and possession with intent to supply a controlled drug.</p>","Bracknell","Dr Phillip Lee",,"2017-03-03T14:45:56.15Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/693813/answer","Biography information for Dr Phillip Lee","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/693813/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/693813/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-02-23","Prisons: Drugs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment she has made of the level of drug dealing in (a) HMP Wormwood Scrubs and (b) HMP Pentonville.","false","Biography information for Catherine West","Hornsey and Wood Green","Catherine West","65409"
