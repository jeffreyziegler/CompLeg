On 20 August HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) announced that there would be a temporary reduction in Birmingham’s capacity by 300 places. The capacity reduction was carefully managed and we worked closely with Governors across the estate to mitigate the impact elsewhere. The reduction in places was delivered through end of sentence releases, the diversion of court allocations to other prisons in the region and routine allocations of men to other establishments as part of their sentence progression. Men were transferred under the same criteria as all prison moves, taking into account a range of factors such as security category, resettlement needs and release address, offending behaviour needs and personal circumstances.

We take seriously the need to support vulnerable claimants moving to Universal Credit; we will work with stakeholders and organisations to understand the best way to support all of our customers to move to Universal Credit. Through a safe and gradual start for Managed Migration, we will be able to determine the best way to support everyone to successfully move to Universal Credit.</p><p> </p><p>In our high-level design for managed migration, there is a comprehensive preparation period for claimants, which will last between four to six months.

These communications will also outline the additional support available to help them to make their claim.</p><p> </p><p>After this period, claimants will receive a migration notification which sets out the timescale for them to make their Universal Credit claim. The regulations set out a minimum of one month but there is flexibility to extend this period if it is identified that certain claimants, such as those who are vulnerable or have complex needs, require longer timescales to make their Universal Credit claim. There is no limit on the number of times that a claimant may ask to extend their deadline, providing that they have a good reason for doing so.

Sexual harassment affects both men and women, and all personnel have the right to work in an environment which is free from discrimination and unacceptable behaviour of any form. Personnel should be confident that any allegations will be taken very seriously and action will be taken to deal with it.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Naval Service</strong></p><p>The Naval Service has a range of policies which espouse the law as contained in the Equality Act 2010, which is that personnel must not engage in discrimination, victimisation or harassment. Harassment involving unwanted conduct of a sexual nature is addressed within those policies. In particular, the Tri-Service Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct (as contained in Joint Service Publication 887: ‘Diversity, Inclusion and Social Conduct’) is widely briefed during Naval initial training and well as on Divisional and leadership courses. It forms a fundamental element of Naval Ethos, Values and Standards and as such is briefed regularly as part of routine Divisional Briefings.</p><p> </p><p>The Naval Service also ensures that all those in Service understand that poor behaviour, including sexual harassment, will not be tolerated. This is primarily achieved through leadership and education including a widely published Diversity and Inclusion Direction from the First Sea Lord; published Diversity and Inclusion statements from Commanding Officers which take a very firm line on poor behaviours, and recently updated Diversity and Inclusion mandatory training which specifically addresses the issue of the effect poor behaviour can have on team building, operational capability and mission success and the individuals involved.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Army</strong></p><p>The 2018 Army Sexual Harassment Survey follows the previous 2015 survey and the Army has already committed to repeating it again in 2021, underlining its commitment to improving behaviours and openly holding itself to account against the highest standards.</p><p> </p><p>The Army’s Action Plan for addressing the issues raised by the survey can be found at the link below. This sets out some of the steps being taken including increased education and training, reviewing and simplifying reporting processes and further enhancing the support available to those who have experienced sexual harassment.</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/army-sexual-harassment-report-and-action-plan-2018" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/army-sexual-harassment-report-and-action-plan-2018</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Royal Air Force (RAF)</strong></p><p>The RAF, in line with the other Services, has a range of policies and processes which help meet the legal obligations contained within the Equality Act 2010 and the RAF’s specific legal duty as part of the Public Sector to show due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other prohibited conduct. Harassment involving unwanted conduct of a sexual nature is addressed within those policies, including the Tri-Service Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct which is widely briefed during initial training and as part of command, management and leadership courses at all levels. Air Publication 1, ‘Ethos, Core Values and Standards’, reiterates the standards expected of all personnel and identifies unwelcome sexual attention in the form of physical or verbal conduct as an example of unacceptable personal behaviour.

E-cigarettes are not risk free. However, the evidence is increasingly clear that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco, and can help smokers to quit, particularly when combined with stop smoking services. In the Tobacco Control Plan for England published in July 2017, the Government committed Public Health England (PHE) to updating its evidence report on e-cigarettes and other novel nicotine delivery systems annually until the end of the Parliament in 2022. PHE’s latest report was published on 6 February 2018 and is available at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/684963/Evidence_review_of_e-cigarettes_and_heated_tobacco_products_2018.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/684963/Evidence_review_of_e-cigarettes_and_heated_tobacco_products_2018.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p>PHE’s evidence review argues that e-cigarette use, alone or in combination with licensed medication and behavioural support from a stop smoking service, appears to be helpful in the short term, and that e-cigarettes have contributed to tens of thousands of additional quitters from smoking in England.</p><p> </p><p>The PHE evidence review concluded that “to date there have been no identified health risks of passive vaping to bystanders”. PHE has produced guidance for organisations on developing appropriate vaping policies for public places and workplaces. Such policies should be based on the evidence and support smokers to quit while managing any identified risks.</p><p> </p><p>If local stop smoking services wish to discuss vaping as a tool to stop smoking they are able to do so. Both PHE and the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training have provided advice to support this.</p><p> </p><p>PHE has committed to include messages about the relative safety of e-cigarettes within quit smoking campaigns such as during the annual Stoptober campaign.</p><p> </p><p>The United Kingdom Government transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive into UK legislation through the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016. This legislation covers e-cigarettes and vaping liquids and requires producers who supply or intend to supply electronic cigarettes or refill containers to notify the Secretary of State in accordance with the regulations. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is the competent authority for the notification scheme for e-cigarettes and refill containers in the UK. A list of products that have been notified to the MHRA is available on gov.uk.</p><p> </p><p>The Tobacco Control Plan for England, published in July 2017, committed the Government to seek to support consumers in stopping smoking and adopting the use of less harmful nicotine products. PHE provides advice on quitting smoking and has highlighted the potential role of e-cigarettes in doing so. PHE’s latest Health Matters blog ‘Stop Smoking: What Works?’ provides advice to smokers on different options to help them quit, including e-cigarettes as well as nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medicines.
