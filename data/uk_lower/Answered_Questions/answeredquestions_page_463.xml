Under this Government fewer individuals are entering the criminal justice system for the first time but those who do offend are more likely to go to prison, and for longer.</p><p> </p><p>Prisoners serving life sentences, imprisonment for public protection, certain extended determinate sentences and some historical long determinate sentences of four years or more for a serious sexual or violent crime committed prior to 5 April 2005, and also certain offenders who have been recalled for breach of their licence conditions, are subject to discretionary release by the Parole Board. A prisoner serving a life sentence or a sentence of imprisonment for public protection must serve their minimum term in full before being eligible for consideration for release. A prisoner serving an extended determinate sentence of 10 years or more must serve at least two-thirds of their custodial term before being considered for release, and a prisoner serving an historical long determinate sentence must serve at least half of their custodial term before being eligible to come before the Parole Board.</p><p> </p><p>All prisoners are subject to the same release test and they are only released (prior to any automatic release provisions which may apply in the case of determinate sentence prisoners) if the Parole Board is satisfied that it is safe to do so.

Fixed term recalls are not available for offenders serving indeterminate or extended sentences. The sentence imposed for the further offence may also affect when the offender next becomes eligible to be considered for release. The seriousness of the further offence committed, the offender’s general behaviour on licence and their level of risk will, of course, be important factors which the Parole Board will take into account when considering re-release. Where a recalled offender is serving an indeterminate sentence it is possible that they will remain in prison for the rest of their life, and other offenders serving determinate sentences may remain in prison until the end of their custodial term, but it is important to review their progress regularly to determine whether or not the offender’s continued detention is necessary to protect the public.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has no current plans to change the above arrangements.</p>","Hemel Hempstead","Mike Penning","214734","2014-11-24T17:31:52.407Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156046/answer","Biography information for Sir Mike Penning","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156046/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156046/answer",,,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-17","Parole","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, if he will bring forward proposals to make prisoners released on parole from life sentences ineligible for parole again if they reoffend.","false","Biography information for Philip Davies","Shipley","Philip Davies","214490"

It is available only to those offenders on licence who are not assessed as presenting a high risk of harm to the public. Offenders who are assessed as presenting a high risk of harm are not eligible to receive a fixed-term recall and will be given a standard recall, under which they can remain in custody, potentially, until the end of their sentence.

The test will guide offender managers, so that all relevant considerations are taken into account before a decision is taken on the type of recall appropriate to deal with the breach of licence conditions.

A prisoner serving a life sentence or a sentence of imprisonment for public protection must serve their minimum term in full before being eligible for consideration for release. A prisoner serving an extended determinate sentence of 10 years or more must serve at least two-thirds of their custodial term before being considered for release, and a prisoner serving an historical long determinate sentence must serve at least half of their custodial term before being eligible to come before the Parole Board.</p><p> </p><p>All prisoners are subject to the same release test and they are only released (prior to any automatic release provisions which may apply in the case of determinate sentence prisoners) if the Parole Board is satisfied that it is safe to do so.

The sentence imposed for the further offence may also affect when the offender next becomes eligible to be considered for release.

Where a recalled offender is serving an indeterminate sentence it is possible that they will remain in prison for the rest of their life, and other offenders serving determinate sentences may remain in prison until the end of their custodial term, but it is important to review their progress regularly to determine whether or not the offender’s continued detention is necessary to protect the public.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has no current plans to change the above arrangements.</p>","Hemel Hempstead","Mike Penning","214490","2014-11-24T17:31:52.5Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156061/answer","Biography information for Sir Mike Penning","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156061/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156061/answer",,,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-17","Parole","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, if he will bring forward proposals to restrict the right of prisoners to be eligible for parole on multiple occasions.","false","Biography information for Philip Davies","Shipley","Philip Davies","214734"

In an article in the Irish Independent on 6 November 2014, Irish Justice Minister Francs Fitzgerald emphasised that the Arrest Warrant had &quot;greatly assisted our mutual efforts to fight cross-border crime and to bring serious criminals, including terrorists, to justice&quot;. <br><br>The Irish Government also made clear in a letter dated 4 September 2014 from the Justice Minister to the Home Secretary, that if the UK failed to opt in to the package of the Arrest Warrant by 1 December 2014, there would have been no guarantee that the courts would consider their obligations under previously issued Arrest Warrants to be ongoing.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/155513","Home Office","false","2014-11-19","<p>The Government believes the Arrest Warrant has greatly improved extradition relations with Ireland, and has considered this matter extensively. <br><br>Between 1973 and 1999 eight people in total were extradited to the UK from Ireland for terrorism offences.

The principal means is by way of a positive recommendation from the independent Parole Board, which falls to officials either to accept or reject on behalf of the Secretary of State, under agreed delegated authority. However, ISPs may also apply to progress to open conditions without Parole Board involvement, where they can show exceptional progress in reducing their risk. Each application is determined on its merits under agreed delegated authority from the Secretary of State by officials in the Offender Management and Public Protection Group in the Ministry of Justice.</p><p> </p><p>Determinate sentenced prisoners are assessed for their suitability for open conditions by experienced prison staff with relevant input from offender managers and other professionals within the prison. The assessment will consider the extent to which the prisoner has reduced identified risks and any intelligence or other information that provides evidence of the prisoner’s trustworthiness for conditions of very low security. Determinate sentence prisoners should not generally be moved to open prison if they have more than two years to serve to their earliest release date, unless assessment of a prisoner’s individual risks and needs support earlier categorisation to open conditions. Such cases must have the reasons for their categorisation fully documented and confirmed in writing by the Governing Governor.</p><p> </p><p>All offenders located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and their risks have been deemed manageable in open conditions.</p><p> </p><p>The public have understandable concerns about the failure of some prisoners to return from temporary release from open prison. Keeping the public safe is our priority and we will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders to undermine public confidence in the prison system. The number of temporary release failures remains very low; less that one failure in every 1,000 releases and about five in every 100,000 releases involving alleged offending, but we take each and every incident seriously. The Government has already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. Prisoners are now no longer eligible for transfer to open conditions if they have previously absconded from open prisons; or if they have failed to return or reoffended whilst released on temporary licence, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>","South West Bedfordshire","Andrew Selous",,"2014-12-02T10:35:36.047Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/155546/answer","Biography information for Andrew Selous","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/155546/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/155546/answer",,,,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-11-11","Open Prisons","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prisoners serving what sentence length are being held in open prisons.","false","Biography information for Philip Davies","Shipley","Philip Davies","214197"
