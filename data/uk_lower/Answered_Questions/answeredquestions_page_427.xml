The Rohingya continue to suffer from severe restrictions on their freedom of movement, on their access to livelihoods, schools, healthcare and places of worship. Burma’s refusal to ensure humanitarian access or recognise citizenship claims of the Rohingya has compounded the denial of the most basic rights. We continue to urge the Burmese authorities to work towards a long-term solution that brings peace and reconciliation and ensures the civil and human rights of all communities within Rakhine State, including full citizenship for the Rohingya. <br><br>The UK has been concerned by the dramatic rise in the number of people taking boats from the Bay of Bengal to the wider region this year. We were deeply concerned by the discovery of mass graves in Thailand and, more recently, in Malaysia. Tackling this issue requires a coordinated regional response and we welcome the Government of Thailand’s decision to hold the 29 May regional meeting to discuss solutions. <br><br>It is vital to address the scourge of human trafficking. The desperate living conditions faced by the Rohingya in particular, and their lack of basic rights, are driving many of these people to make the dangerous journey to other countries in the region.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/229360","Department for Education","false","2015-03-26","<p>Schools have an important role to play in supporting children and young people around good mental health. Many schools provide their pupils with support services such as counselling. In order to help them do this effectively, the Department for Education published a blueprint for school counselling services, on 25 March 2015. This was developed in conjunction with experts in the field, and provides head teachers with practical advice on how to secure high-quality school based counselling services. More information can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counselling-in-schools" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counselling-in-schools</a>. The Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) Association published guidance, funded by the Department for Education, on providing age-appropriate teaching about mental health problems. This guidance can be found at: <a href="http://www.pshe-association.org.uk/emotionalhealth" target="_blank">www.pshe-association.org.uk/emotionalhealth</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, the Department recognises that teachers are not mental health professionals and need access to specialist support. Our ‘Mental health and behaviour in schools’ guidance, first published in June 2014, provides teachers with information and tools that will help them to identify pupils who need help, provide effective early support and understand when a referral to a specialist mental health service may be necessary. More information can be found here: <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Future in Mind”, the report published by the Government’s children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing taskforce, was published on 17 March 2015<a title="" href="http://3dcpri-papp09/new_parliamentaryquestion/228880-%20Mike%20Kane/Draft/228880%20-%20QA%20-%20250315.docx#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a>: It sets out the Department’s ambitions for 2020, including for improved access to support through named points of contact in specialist mental health services and schools. The report also outlines our ambitions for mental health specialists to work directly in schools and GP practices.
