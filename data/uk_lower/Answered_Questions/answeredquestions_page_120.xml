This means that working families claiming Universal Credit can reclaim up to 85 per cent of their eligible childcare costs each month, up to a maximum of £646.35 for one child and £1,108.04 for two or more children.</p><p>DWP continues to improve the Universal Credit experience for claimants and to ensure that they are supported throughout their journey. For those with children, this includes ensuring that help with up front childcare costs is available for Universal Credit households with a low income.</p><p>Claimants with a firm job offer can claim Universal Credit childcare costs up to 1 month prior to starting work to enable their children to settle into a new routine. We also offer extra support to enable parents to pay upfront childcare costs or deposits: for example, claimants may be eligible to receive an advance of their future Universal Credit entitlement, which is interest free. Work coaches and claimants work together to ensure that, where this is taken up, repayments are affordable and manageable.</p><p>If a budgeting advance is not appropriate, the Flexible Support Fund may also provide assistance. Payments from this fund are non-repayable, and are managed locally to provide tailored and targeted support for claimants to move into work.</p><p>Since February 2018, Universal Credit claimants have been able to upload digital copies of their childcare cost receipts or invoices through their online Universal Credit account, all of which make it even easier for claimants to apply for Universal Credit.</p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma","169047","2018-09-06T14:31:17.337Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964834/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964834/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/964834/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-09-03","Children: Day Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if she will take steps to reduce upfront childcare costs for low income families in receipt of universal credit.","false","Biography information for Ruth George","High Peak","Ruth George","169831"

As outlined on GOV.UK, DWP complaints processes encourages customers in the first instance to raise their issues with the office they are dealing with, as a business as usual contact, so we put things right.</p><p> </p><p>If the customer remains unhappy with the response, they can escalate their concerns, which will be dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team as part of the formal DWP complaints process. The complaint is independently investigated. Where cases cannot be resolved to the customer’s satisfaction, the customer can escalate their complaint to the Director General as part of the tier two complaint process.</p><p> </p><p>Escalated complaints represent the final business review and response to the complaint.</p><p>Once a complainant has exhausted the DWP complaint process they are signposted to the Independent Case Examiner’s (ICE) Office if they are dissatisfied with the final response to their complaint.</p><p> </p><p>Complaints received from women born in the 1950s and affected by changes in State Pension age are handled in line with the overall Departmental complaints process published on GOV.UK.</p><p> </p><p>The role of the Independent Case Examiner (ICE) is to consider case-specific complaints of maladministration (service failure). The vast majority of the complaints that are referred to ICE are complex and require the circumstances of each case to be considered on its merits. Prior to the WASPI campaign the ICE Office routinely accepted in the region of 1,100 and 1,200 complaints for examination each year. At the end of February 2018, the Office had accepted 1,907 WASPI complaints alone.</p><p> </p><p>In January 2017, the ICE Office took the decision to bring a lead case into investigation in order to familiarise itself with the issues underpinning the campaign. This investigation concluded in June 2017 – the ICE did not uphold the complaint. Whilst the Office has had no additional resource to deal with the WASPI campaign complaints, a dedicated team of investigation case managers was established (from within existing resources) in October 2017 to investigate this group of complaints. The ICE Office aim to complete investigation within 20 weeks of starting work on a case, the WASPI related ICE reports that had been concluded to date have been completed within an average of 9.75 weeks. To date, the ICE had not upheld any case specific complaints that DWP failed to provide adequate and timely information relating to the increase in their State Pension age. All final ICE reports explain how the complainant can escalate their complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s Office.</p><p> </p><p>There are no plans to dedicate additional resources to investigating this group of complaints, as to do so would disadvantage other groups of complainants whose cases are awaiting investigation.</p><p> </p><p>The Parliamentary Health and Service Ombudsman make final decisions on complaints that have not been resolved by UK Government Departments.

There are measures in place to monitor the effectiveness and participation levels of physical education (PE) across the prison estate, and the standards of sports and activities are monitored by Physical Education Managers (PEM). I have attached available data in relation to prisoner participation levels over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, data for 2011 – 2012 is not available.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Our response to Professor Rosie Meek's independent review of sport and physical activity sets out some of the work we are doing to improve provision of sport and physical activity education in the secure youth estate. That response can be found here: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/733311/a-sporting-chance-govt-response.pdf" target="_blank">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/733311/a-sporting-chance-govt-response.pdf</a>. Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) also recently conducted a strategic review of PE in prisons which examined current delivery, and measured delivery effectiveness against specifications. It also considered how current PE delivery meets the needs of prisoners, staff, and the emerging requirements from prison reform initiatives. We hope to publish these findings in due course. HMPPS does not separately identify spending associated with sports programmes. The information in relation to the amount spent in 2009 and 2017 could only be obtained at disproportionate cost</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Prisoner participation levels from data available – Physical Education </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="5"><p><strong>2017 -

In addition, there are several third sector organisations that provide a range of support to breast cancer patients across the area.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England is committed to transforming cancer care across England for all cancers, including breast cancer, aiming to reduce inequality and promoting equity of access to services. To support this ambition, NHS England has committed more than £200 million in 2017/18 and 2018/19 to fund Cancer Alliances to accelerate early diagnosis of cancer, improve survival and enhance quality of life.</p><p> </p><p>In February 2018, in partnership with the Department and NHS England, Public Health England (PHE) launched a Be Clear on Cancer Campaign focused on breast cancer in women aged over 70 to raise awareness of specific symptoms and encourage those with symptoms to visit their doctor.</p><p> </p><p>To improve the uptake of screening, NHS England is continuing to invest in initiatives to help ensure equality of access, including through locally targeted interventions. These include text and general practitioner reminders and PHE’s new ‘Breast screening: easy guide’, which helps women decide whether screening is right for them.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England agreed a Commercial Access Agreement with Roche for Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) which brought the confidential purchase price below the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence cost-effectiveness threshold, allowing approval in routine commissioning. This is offering breast cancer patients precious quality time with their families without damaging side effects.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, we are committed to rolling out stratified follow-up pathways for breast cancer patients by 2020, to ensure patients get the right care after treatment, including information and support to spot signs and symptoms of recurrence or secondary cancer. As well as providing a better experience for patients and ensuring they have the information they need, stratified pathways can offer more effective use of resources by freeing up outpatient capacity. They can also ensure that in cases where there is recurrence or secondary cancer, patients are supported to return to care quickly and effectively.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine",,"2018-09-10T16:58:31.003Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/947427/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/947427/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/947427/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-07-24","Breast Cancer","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what assessment he has made of the levels of care and support available for women with breast cancer in (a) the West Midlands and (b) England.","false","Biography information for Richard Burden","Birmingham, Northfield","Richard Burden","167862"

I am unable to say how this application was funded because the variation was not sought by this office. At the same time, an application by News Group and Mirror Group Newspapers, who opposed the continued prohibition of the publication of Jon Venables’ new name, was heard and rejected.</p><p>On 31 August 2012, on the application of the Secretary of State for Justice, the High Court amended the terms of the Injunction.
