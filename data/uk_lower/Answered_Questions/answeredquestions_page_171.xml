However, any members of the public who do report feeling unwell should seek health care/advice from their GP, NHS 111 or A&amp;E.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Notices should be put up in the affected areas warning the public to avoid contact with the water especially dog walkers (whose dogs should be kept on the lead), anglers, canoeists or others performing water sports. The water should not be drunk, bathed in or used for washing or cooking</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The incident has had a significant, localised effect on water quality, impacted on the quality and use of the river and caused minor damage to nature conservation.</p><p> </p><p>The EA, along with its contractors Adler and Allan, has been working to remove oil from the River Lea Navigation since 12 February 2018. The EA is also being assisted with clean-up efforts by the Canal and River Trust and volunteers at various locations between Stonebridge Locks and Old Ford Locks.</p><p> </p><p>Thames Water Utilities Limited, which owns the surface water sewer and outfall from which the oil entered the Pymmes Brook at Tottenham Marshes, has also contracted Adler and Allan to flush through the drainage system and tanker off any residual oil still present at the outfall and within the infrastructure.</p><p> </p><p>Once the works have been completed at the outfall there should be no further oil from this particular incident. The EA expects that the effects of the pollution on the watercourse will be cleared by 9 March, dependant on factors such as weather conditions for moving specialised equipment.</p><p> </p><p>The EA records, assesses and responds to pollution incidents that are reported to it. Where there are repeated oil pollution incidents in a particular location, the EA works with partners to investigate and take the required steps to advise businesses and householders on the actions they need to take to stop the pollution and prevent recurrence. If enforcement action is required the EA can serve enforcement notices to require actions to be taken, and for the most serious incidents it can prosecute offenders.</p><p> </p><p>In November 2017 EA and the Canal and River Trust (CRT) agreed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure effective co-operation between them in dealing with pollution incidents, including oil spills, in or affecting CRT’s waterway network. The EA will continue to lead on the more serious category 1 and category 2 pollution incidents affecting CRT waterways, while CRT will lead on the less serious category 3 and 4 incidents. The CRT and EA will work together on incident response, cost recovery, and on local contacts and working together arrangements.</p><p> </p><p>In a typical recent year (2016) the EA recorded 310 water pollution incidents in canals and inland waterways, of which 25 were categorised as serious. Typically around 25% of water pollution incidents reported to the EA involve oil as a pollutant.</p><p> </p><p>The EA and CRT have the capacity to deal with incidents on a risk basis. New approaches, such as the MoU, enable them to be even more effective by pooling resources. Where a large oil spill affects a waterbody the EA can call in extra resources such as specialist contractors to carry out clean-up work. Where the polluter is identified the EA can recover the costs of the clean up under section 161 of the Water Resources Act.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/850307/answer",,,,,"129872 ; 129873 ; 129874","2018-03-06T12:18:49.987Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/850307/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/850307/answer",,,,,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2018-02-26","Inland Waterways: Pollution Control","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps he is taking to prevent oil spills in areas in which repeat incidents have occurred.","false","Biography information for Mr David Lammy","Tottenham","Mr David Lammy","129875"

We are appalled by the violence used by Democratic Republic of Congo forces against peaceful protestors. We have publicly condemned the excessive use of force on both 31 December 2017 and 21 January 2018.

The Government does not currently have plans to sanction the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, alongside regional and international partners, we will continue to press the Democratic Republic of Congo authorities to adhere to their electoral commitment, to open up political space, and to allow for peaceful assembly.</p>",,"Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/847852/answer",,,,,,"2018-03-09T11:21:53.217Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/847852/answer","Biography information for Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/847852/answer",,,,,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2018-02-23","Democratic Republic of Congo: Freezing of Assets","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they plan to freeze the UK assets of the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his close associates, until such time as the Saint Sylvestre Agreement is implemented.","false","Biography information for Lord Hylton",,"Lord Hylton","HL5829"
