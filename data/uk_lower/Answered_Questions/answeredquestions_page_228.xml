Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.</p><p><sup>2 </sup>The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 4 prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. It should be noted that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients undergoing a ‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two procedures – removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one – counted in a single episode.</p><p><sup>3 </sup>Included in the codes are for both partial and total joint replacements as well as conversion and revision codes. The ‘Conversion to’ codes provided in this resolution (e.g. W40.2) are assigned when the procedure has converted to the specified type of joint replacement from a different type of joint replacement. Examples could include conversion to a cemented total shoulder replacement following previous partial shoulder replacement or conversion to a total shoulder replacement following a previous uncemented shoulder replacement. This principle would apply to all ‘Conversion to’ prosthetic joint procedures provided. The ‘Conversion to’ codes could be considered ‘revisions’ in clinical terms, and you may wish to include these codes in your data search.</p><p><sup>4 </sup>A range of OPCS codes covering knee replacements, hemiarthroplasty knees, unicomparmental knee replacements, hip replacements, hemiarthroplasty hips, shoulder replacements and hemiarthroplasty shoulder have been included.</p><p><sup>5 </sup>HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in National Health Service practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely, apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information. It should be noted that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March, e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.</p>","Ludlow","Mr Philip Dunne",,"2017-09-18T13:01:41.117Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/759342/answer","Biography information for Mr Philip Dunne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/759342/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/759342/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-09-11","Joint Replacements","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, how many (a) knee, (b) hip and (c) shoulder replacements have been undertaken by the NHS in each of the last five years; and how many people aged (i) 30 to 40, (ii) 41 to 50, (iii) 51 and 60 and (iv) over 60 had such replacements.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","10007"

Six providers are piloting primary testing for HPV within the National Health Service National Cervical Screening Programme in England, and NHS England has been working in partnership with Public Health England (PHE) to determine the most clinically safe and effective way of implementing this change into the programme by the end of December 2019. The UK NSC reviews its recommendations regularly, usually on a three year cycle.</p><p> </p><p>On the advice of the UK NSC, NHS England is introducing a new easier to use home testing screening kit, which supports early diagnosis of bowel cancer from April 2018. Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) for haemoglobin will replace Faecal Occult Blood testing (FOBt) from April 2018. FIT is likely to increase the uptake of bowel screening by 7%, as evidenced in the FIT pilot in England where the test was found to be more favourable for the public. FIT will contribute to the reduction of inequalities in screening and cancer outcomes. Upon implementation, NHS England will review the opportunities that general practitioners have to help maximise uptake of this screening programme amongst their population.
