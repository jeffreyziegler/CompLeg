Taking a life course approach, we are working across Government and with local authorities, voluntary organisations and employers in the public and private sectors to achieve this. Help and support for people with autism includes:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Access to Work, a discretionary grant scheme which offers advice and practical and financial support above the level of reasonable adjustments to disabled people who are in work or about to start work. Access to Work has also put in place a Hidden Impairment Specialist Team that gives advice and guidance to help employers support employees with conditions such as Autism, Learning Disability and/or Mental Health conditions. It also offers eligible people an assessment to find out their needs at work and help to develop a support plan.</li><li>In 2017/18, the highest ever number of people received AtW payments - 33,860, up 13% on 2016/17.</li><li>Through working with Autism Alliance, we have developed the Disability Confident Autism and Neurodiversity Toolkit, to help staff from all Government Departments understand how to support people with autism and associated neuro-diverse conditions. We also developed the Disability Passport ‘About Me’ which aims to encourage disabled claimants, including individuals with autism, to disclose their disability/ health conditions at the earliest stage to their Adviser, to improve communication and ensure reasonable adjustments are put in place. Both the toolkit and passport are hosted on Autism Alliance’s website.</li><li>Also through working with Autism Alliance, we delivered Autism and Hidden Impairment training to over 1000 nominated staff across the Jobcentre Plus network. Feedback from delegates confirms that the training helped staff to understand how to support people with autism or hidden impairments into employment.</li><li>The Civil Service has committed to support the Autism Exchange Programme, and my Department is working with Ambitious about Autism to provide work placement opportunities for young people.</li><li>Through the Disability Confident scheme, DWP is engaging with employers and helping to promote the skills, talents and abilities of people with autism and associated hidden impairment conditions. Through the scheme, DWP is providing advice and support to help employers feel more confident about employing disabled people, by signposting them to appropriate advice guidance and support.</li></ul><p><em>Improving Lives: the Future of Work, Health and Disability</em>, published last year, sets out the Government’s strategy for helping people with disabilities or health conditions, including learning difficulties and autism, enter and remain in employment.

This change will support vulnerable claimants financially when moving to Universal Credit. From April 2019, the amount people with disabilities (and also households with children) can earn before their Universal Credit award begins to be withdrawn – the Work Allowance – will be increased by £1000, meaning they can keep an extra £630 per year.</p><p> </p><p>Earlier this year we announced transitional payments for former recipients of Severe Disability Premium (SDP), and protections for those who are receiving SDP as part of their existing benefit entitlement.

Those who have already moved to Universal Credit will receive transitional protection back-dated to the start of their Universal Credit claim and will also receive on-going monthly payments.

Secondary legislation and preparation for project implementation is under way with the launch planned for April 2019. These changes pave the way to a greater mix of working arrangements and are expected to increase the diversity of our Armed Forces and build on our reputation as an equal opportunities employer.</p><p>Defence is dedicated to achieving a more diverse workforce and is undertaking a wide range of activities to increase the number of female recruits into the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are working towards a target of 15% female recruitment by 2020. This challenging target reflects the importance Defence places on having Armed Forces that better reflect the society they serve. Work to increase female representation includes better understanding and greater engagement with females, reviewing recruitment processes; and better targeted marketing and communications towards potential female applicants.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has also undertaken a number of actions aimed at increasing gender equality within the Armed Forces. This includes incorporating gender issues into relevant Armed Forces doctrine and pre-deployment training. The Armed Forces undertake mandatory diversity and inclusion training on entry into service and every two years. Equality and diversity advisors are also embedded within each unit. Each service has a senior gender advocate and a servicewomen's network to improve access and opportunities for women.</p><p>For civil servants the MOD contributes to and fully supports the Civil Service schemes 'Crossing Thresholds' and 'Positive Action Pathway', both of which either fully or in part seek to promote gender equality in career development.

However, HMRC has advised that in situations like these, where an employer pays or reimburses their employees’ application costs, such a payment would be taxable as earnings from their employment and may also attract a National Insurance contributions (NICs) charge. However, employers can also choose to meet the cost of this tax and NICs charge for their employees. For many employers this can be managed within their existing arrangements with HMRC, using a PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) which allows employers to make one annual payment to cover all the tax and NICs due on minor, irregular or impracticable expenses or benefits for their staff.</p>","Romsey and Southampton North","Caroline Nokes",,"2018-12-21T17:39:33.4Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/999321/answer","Biography information for Caroline Nokes","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/999321/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/999321/answer",,,,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2018-10-31","Immigration: EU Nationals","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will make it Government policy to enable employers to make (a) the required Settled Status payments directly to his Department on behalf of employees and (b) ensure that such support is not treated as a benefit in kind.","false","Biography information for Martyn Day","Linlithgow and East Falkirk","Martyn Day","186400"
