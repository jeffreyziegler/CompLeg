All prisoners, including those serving IPP sentences, have their suitability for any accredited programmes considered as part of their wider sentence plan.

We are working across government to develop a new strategy for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) in 2019, which will include addressing the needs of refugees.</p><p>The department funds ESOL through the Adult Education Budget, which is allocated to providers on an annual basis. Colleges and adult learning providers have the freedom and flexibility to determine how they use their Adult Education Budget allocation to meet the needs of their communities. This includes planning, with local partners, the ESOL courses that they will deliver locally. The Home Office and the Department for Education have provided £10 million to enable refugees resettled through the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme to access additional classes.</p><p>We know that there are many examples of good practice to overcome barriers for learners with childcare needs. Through the ESOL strategy, we will explore what else needs to be done to enable good local solutions and to support greater access to English language provision.</p><p>All 3 and 4 year olds in England are entitled to 570 hours a year of funded early education over no fewer than 38 weeks of the year (which equates to 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year) irrespective of the immigration status of the child or their parent(s).</p><p>Local authorities have a duty to provide information, advice and assistance for parents and prospective parents on the provision of childcare in their area.

It leads government’s Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) function, helping departments build and run services that are digital by default and focused on the needs of citizens.</p><p>Departments have built their digital professionalism and capability and there are now approximately 800 digital services, including applying online for a UK passport, applying for your full or provisional driving licence, checking your state pension, and the voter registration digital service. As an example, over 90% of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Association’s (DVLA) transactions (over 1 billion in 2017/18) are now completed online. Government continues to update current and create new digital services to benefit citizens in their interactions with government.</p><p>GDS this month published the Government Technology Innovation Strategy which looks at creating the right foundations to use emerging technologies in government. This will help digitally transform government even more by using innovative technology solutions to make government more efficient and save taxpayers’ money. Alongside this, ‘A guide to using artificial intelligence in the public sector’ was published following a review of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government by GDS and the Office for Artificial Intelligence (OAI).</p><p>The £20m, 3-year GovTech Catalyst Programme has supported central and local government, devolved administrations, and public sector bodies to find innovative solutions to operational service and policy delivery challenges. It provides public sector organisations a safe space to experiment with innovative technologies by providing them with funding, purely for research and development. The Catalyst also encourages the sharing of digital learning and resources, which allows public sector organisations to identify other groups across the UK working on similar problems. The Programme helps government deliver on a key principle of the UK’s Digital Strategy, to improve the digital business sector in the UK, by providing tech companies of all sizes opportunities with the public sector.</p><p>Over 10,000 civil servants have also now been trained by the GDS Academy; new standards have made services across government consistent, accessible and intuitive; and departments have delivered digital services to make essential transactions with citizens easier and more efficient.</p>",,"Lord Young of Cookham",,"2019-06-20T14:25:42.437Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1131913/answer","Biography information for Lord Young of Cookham","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1131913/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1131913/answer",,,,,"53","Cabinet Office","Cabinet Office","2019-06-12","Electronic Government","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to invest in the digital transformation of government services.","false","Biography information for Lord Taylor of Warwick",,"Lord Taylor of Warwick","HL16331"

Schools are also able to cover enterprise and entrepreneurship teaching within their personal, social, health and economic education.</p><p>In addition to this the government’s careers strategy, published in December 2017, aims to give young people from all backgrounds the opportunity to learn from employers about work and the skills that are valued in the workplace. It introduces a new expectation that all secondary schools should offer every young person at least seven encounters with employers as part of a high-quality careers programme during their education, including those who are self-employed.</p><p>The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company’s network of enterprise advisers supports the delivery of this ambition. Enterprise advisers are senior business volunteers who help schools to work with local businesses. The network is already operating in over half of secondary schools and colleges, and will be available to all of them by 2020.</p><p>Character education is also important, and the great majority of schools provide this through the culture and ethos of the school, and through extra-curricular activities.
