ISDS provisions can help to create a positive investment climate and promote growth. As such, ISDS will not have a direct impact on consumers, who will benefit from other elements of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and who have separate routes for seeking redress. The UK currently has over 90 investment protection agreements with other countries. While a number of UK businesses have used ISDS to seek compensation, there has been no successful action against the UK in respect of any of these agreements. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has commissioned research into investment protection agreements and the ISDS mechanism, reviewed academic research, consulted external experts and carried out its own internal analysis on investment provisions. The ISDS provisions in TTIP are still under negotiation. We believe these provisions must strike the right balance between protecting investors and the host nation’s right to regulate and determine policy.

However, we do know that cancer survival and mortality rates continue to improve and we are developing proxy measures to assess progress in a more timely manner, particularly in terms of the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages one and two and cancers diagnosed through emergency routes.</p><p>The National Health Service and Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators and the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) Outcomes Indicator Set are starting to enable us to assess progress, at national and local level. For example, data on one-year survival from all cancers and one-year survival from breast, lung and colorectal cancer were published as part of the CCG outcomes indicator set for the first time on 19 June 2014. NHS England is continuing to monitor the progress of the National Health Service in reducing mortality from cancer in line with the NHS Outcomes Framework, and from 2014-15 there will be a range of new NHS Outcomes Framework indicators on stage of diagnosis which will provide a good proxy measure in future on progress in delivering earlier stage of diagnosis of cancer.</p><p>The Mandate for the NHS for 2014-15 sets out an ambition for England to become one of the most successful countries in Europe at preventing premature deaths. Tackling premature deaths from cancer will contribute to this. A range of work at national and local level is aimed at improving cancer survival.

The revised Prevent strategy published in June 2011 has three key objectives. These are to:</p><p> </p><p>• respond to the ideological challenge of terrorism and the threat we face from those who promote it;</p><p>• prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and ensure that they are given appropriate advice and support; and</p><p>• work with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation</p><p>which we need to address.</p><p> </p><p>The delivery of Prevent requires strong partnerships with a range of local groups in the community, including British Muslims amongst others.</p><p>The Prevent strategy we inherited from the last Government was flawed. It confused the delivery of Government policy to promote integration with Government policy to prevent terrorism, which was a source of mistrust. That is why we refocused the Prevent strategy in 2011, to separate Prevent from broader integration work.</p><p>Local Prevent co-ordinators across the country work with local services,partners such as the police, Charity Commission and members of local faith communities, to understand local risks and needs, and deliver targeted projects and outreach work. We fund 30 Prevent priority areas to work on the frontline and with those vulnerable to extremism, including funding projects tailored to local needs. Prevent co-ordinators provide regular feedback to the Home Office, which helps shape the future development and implementation of the Prevent strategy.</p><p> </p><p>Preventing terrorism means challenging extremist (and non-violent) ideas that are also part of a terrorist ideology. The Prevent strategy focuses on all forms of terrorism, but is clear that the most serious risk to our national security comes from Al Qa’ida, its affiliates and like-minded organisations. For this reason, the report of the Prime Minister’s Extremism Task Force (ETF), published last December, set out a definition of Islamist extremism. It noted that this ideology should not be confused with traditional religious practice.</p><p>It is based on a distorted interpretation of Islam, which betrays Islam’s peaceful principles and also includes the uncompromising belief that people cannot be Muslim and British, and insists that those who do not agree with them are not true Muslims.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire",,"2014-09-01T14:39:18.4617651Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79404/answer","Biography information for James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79404/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79404/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-07-22","Home Office: Written Questions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, when she intends to provide a substantive answer to Question number 204223, tabled for Answer on 14 July 2014.","false","Biography information for Greg Mulholland","Leeds North West","Greg Mulholland","206963"

On 21 July 2014, the Home Secretary commenced the proportionality provisions in the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014. This includes a proportionality filter in relation to SISII Article 26 alerts (European Arrest Warrants). The filter will enable the weeding out of the most trivial European <br>arrest warrants, ensuring resources are dedicated to the most serious criminals and that the police are not overburdened with Article 26 alerts.In terms of other SISII alerts, they only require the UK to notify the issuing Member State that the individual has come to our attention. Therefore, there is expected to be a minimal impact on existing resources.</p><p>The UK has made no distinction between the definitions used in Article 36 (chapter VIII) as concerns discreet and specific checks.

Article 72 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes clear that the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security is a responsibility for Member States. Article 276 of the TFEU states that the ECJ shall have no jurisdiction to review the validity or proportionality of operations carried out by the police or other law <br>enforcement services of a Member State, or the exercise of responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security. <br><br>Given that context and the wording of Article 3 of Joint Action 98/700/JHA, the Government considers that any link between the UK’s national systems with EU law is likely to be sufficiently tenuous and indirect to mean that national systems will not be within the scope of EU law for the purposes of the human rights jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the EU. <br><br>The participation of the Associated States in FADO is based on their participation in the Schgenen acquis.</p><p />","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire","207070","2014-09-23T14:35:40.2646176Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79423/answer","Biography information for James Brokenshire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79423/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79423/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-07-22","Organised Crime: EU Law","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, through what legal means Norway, Iceland and Switzerland have access to the False and Authentic Documents Online database established under Joint Action 98700/JHA.","false","Biography information for Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg","North East Somerset","Jacob Rees-Mogg","207075"

Under a life sentence, and an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP), the court determines the minimum period to be served in prison for the purposes of punishment and deterrence. Prisoners serving these indeterminate sentences have no automatic right to be released. If released they are subject to recall for the rest of their life or, in the case of an offender serving an IPP, for at least 10 years. Public protection is the priority and the release of indeterminate sentence prisoners once they have served their minimum term is entirely a matter for the Parole Board.</p><p>Progression to open conditions is never automatic and only follows a satisfactory assessment of risk, generally involving the independent Parole Board in the case of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences.</p><p>The Parole Board may recommend such prisoners for open conditions if, for example: they have successfully completed any offending behaviour programmes identified in their sentence plan as essential to the risk reduction process; their behaviour in custody is such that it is considered that a move is appropriate; and their risks are manageable in open conditions.</p><p>Once allocated to open prison, prisoners continue to be monitored and are returned to closed prison immediately if there are any concerns about their suitability for low security conditions.</p><p> </p><p>Open prisons have been used since 1936, because they are the most effective means of ensuring that prisoners are suitably risk-assessed before they are released into the community under appropriate licence conditions.

It will fall further next year, to 20%, giving the UK the joint lowest rate of corporation tax in the G20. The Small Profits Rate has also been cut to 20%.</p><p> </p><p>These cuts are a central part of the Government’s long-term economic plan. They are intended to make the UK more competitive, supporting business investment and job creation.</p><p> </p><p>Government modeling suggests that the corporation tax cuts introduced in this parliament will:</p><p>· increase business investment by between 2.5% and 4.5% (£3.6bn to £6bn in today’s prices) in the long term</p><p>· increase GDP by between 0.6% and 0.8% (£9.6bn to £12.2bn in today’s prices) in the long term</p><p> </p><p>Foreign direct investment decisions are influenced by a range of factors including skills, market access, and infrastructure. Consequently, it is difficult to isolate the exact impact of the corporation tax cuts from reform in other areas. But recently published data on inward investment has been very encouraging.</p><p> </p><p>In their 2013/2014 Inward Investment Report, UKTI said ONS data showed the value of FDI stock increased from £725.6bn in 2010, to £936.5bn in 2012.</p><p> </p><p>UKTI also reported that the UK attracted more inward investment projects last year than in any year since records began in the 1980s. UKTI recorded 1773 projects, creating 66,390 new jobs.</p><p> </p><p>This is supported by analysis from Ernst and Young, who use their own independent database to assess inward investment. Ernst and Young’s Annual Attractiveness Survey, published in June, showed the number of inward investment projects in the UK had risen by 15% in the past year, against the background of a European market that grew by just 4%.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As noted above, it is difficult to isolate the impact of tax policy on these trends, and UKTI does not have estimates of how much of the new investment has been a direct result of the lower rate of corporation tax. But it is clear that the corporation tax reforms have changed perceptions of the UK competitiveness. For the past two years, the UK has ranked highest in the KPMG survey on international tax competitiveness, ahead of countries including the US, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>","South West Hertfordshire","Mr David Gauke",,"2014-09-01T16:21:34.2079866Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79007/answer","Biography information for Mr David Gauke","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79007/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79007/answer",,,,,"14","Treasury","CaTreasury","2014-07-21","Foreign Investment in UK","1","House of Commons","To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, what estimate he has made of the amount of foreign direct investment generated since 2010 as a direct result of the lower rate of corporation tax.","false","Biography information for Adam Afriyie","Windsor","Adam Afriyie","206722"

The Government remains committed to protecting cultural heritage and we will seek to legislate on the 1954 Hague Convention and the subsequent protocols when parliamentary time allows. The 1954 convention already informs the Armed Forces’ law of armed conflict doctrine and training policy, particularly with regard to respect for cultural property, precautions in attack and recognition of the protective emblem.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is deeply concerned by reports of damage to cultural property in Syria and Northern Iraq, including recent attacks by Islamic State of Iraq and Levant against Mosques, Churches and other holy places. The reported destruction of the Tomb of Yonus (Jonah) in Mosul on 24 July by ISIL is further evidence of the groups barbarism and disregard for International Humanitarian Law. We are also concerned that Syria’s cultural heritage is being plundered for private profit. That is why in December 2013 the UK and other EU nations amended the EU’s sanctions regime to make clear that involvement in trade relating to artefacts illegally removed from Syria is prohibited. This will help safeguard Syria’s cultural heritage for the future and we will continue to do all we can to bring an end to the conflict and restore stability in the region.</p>",,"Lord Wallace of Saltaire",,"2014-08-11T12:48:09.6217849Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79199/answer","Biography information for Lord Wallace of Saltaire","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79199/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/79199/answer",,,,,"10","Culture, Media and Sport","Culture, Media and Sport","2014-07-21","UN Convention for Protection of Cultural Property in Event of Armed Conflict","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the answer by Lord Gardiner of Kimble on 12 May (HL Deb, col 1650), when they expect there to be parliamentary time to introduce legislation to ratify the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict; and what assessment they have made of the damage to cultural property in the recent and continuing armed conflict in Syria and northern Iraq.","false","Biography information for Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn",,"Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn","HL1360"
