The UK’s Corporate Governance Code was revised, with effect from 1 January 2019, to promote the importance of having a clear corporate purpose. The Governance Principles for Large Private Companies developed last year by Sir James Wates do the same. Company reporting requirements, also introduced this year, now require companies to report how they have regard to wider societal interests within the meaning of Section 172 of the Companies Act.</p>","Rochester and Strood","Kelly Tolhurst","5003 ; 5004","2019-10-30T16:53:08.797Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156204/answer","Biography information for Kelly Tolhurst","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156204/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156204/answer","Rochester and Strood","Kelly Tolhurst","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156204/answer/previousversion/2603","Biography information for Kelly Tolhurst","201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2019-10-24","New Businesses","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, what steps she has taken to encourage people setting up businesses to embed (a) social and (b) environmental purpose into their business structures.","false","Biography information for Bill Esterson","Sefton Central","Bill Esterson","5005"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156262","Church Commissioners","false","2019-11-05","<p>The Church of England does not hold data on thefts centrally, but it is kept by local police forces, Historic England and the insurance industry.</p><p>The most prominent form of property theft from churches is that of metal (mainly lead from roofs) and of historic building materials such as flagstones. These are items with a high resale value and which, once removed, can be difficult to identify as coming from a particular place. Because of the largely historic nature of the buildings targeted these thefts are counted as heritage crime. This issue does not just affect churches; it is so widespread that it is the subject of a joint project and Memorandum of Understanding signed by the National Police Chiefs' Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, Historic England and a growing number of local authorities, community safety partnerships and National Park Authorities. It is an agreement to work in partnership with each other to prevent and solve crimes against historic places.</p><p>The Church of England is an active partner in identifying and tackling heritage crime, especially metal theft. The church is part of Operation Crucible, the police-led initiative investigating metal theft, and it has become clear over recent years that this form of criminal behaviour is now being undertaken by organised gangs. The earlier changes to the law did initially lead to a drop in reported incidences, but recently the issue has again become more widespread. The Church of England submitted evidence to the review of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act in 2017 asking the Government to tighten up the Act to better reflect the changing behaviour of both the scrap metal trade and the organised criminal activity.</p><p>Due to the highly mobile nature of this form of organised criminal activity and without increased resource, it is hard to see how police and heritage crime officers will be able to address the increase in thefts we are seeing across the country. Thefts are moving gradually west and north along the major transport routes. This year the Church has had the first reports of metal and stone theft in the Bath &amp; Wells Diocese and in the Yorkshire Dioceses. Tightening up of the law, therefore, needs to be accompanied by increased police resources and greater political will.</p><p>Parish churches are maintained by volunteers on behalf of the local community. Aside from the financial impact of these thefts, the impact on communities is significant. The social and community impact of the crime, as well as the criminal damage to listed buildings, needs to be addressed at sentencing, as even the theft of small amounts of lead or stone cost has a huge impact on local people. These buildings represent our country’s local and national heritage. Due to the highly mobile nature of criminal gangs, it is essential that police and local churches work together to ensure that heritage crime does not become a decreasing priority for police forces.</p>","Meriden","Dame Caroline Spelman",,"2019-11-05T15:30:10.933Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156262/answer","Biography information for Dame Caroline Spelman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156262/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156262/answer","Meriden","Dame Caroline Spelman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1156262/answer/previousversion/3752","Biography information for Dame Caroline Spelman","9","Church Commissioners","Church Commissioners","2019-10-24","Churches: Theft","1","House of Commons","To ask the right hon.
