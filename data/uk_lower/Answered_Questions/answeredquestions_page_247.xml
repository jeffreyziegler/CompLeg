The Foreign Secretary raised the issue of compensation most recently during his meeting with Prime Minister Serraj in Tripoli on 4 May 2017. He emphasised again the importance the UK attaches to this issue and encouraged the Libyan authorities to engage with UK victims' groups and their representatives. Prime Minister Serraj expressed sympathy with those who had suffered from the previous regime, but it was also clear from his discussion with the Foreign Secretary that the Libyan government continues to face numerous challenges and that progress on the issue of compensation is likely to remain slow. We will continue to make clear to the Libyan authorities that this issue is a priority for us.</p><p>Libyan assets in the UK were frozen under UN Security Council Resolution 1973 at the instigation of the Libyan authorities in 2011. In order to amend the UN resolution governing the freezing of Libyan assets in the UK, the Libyan government would need to submit a request to the UN Security Council. The UK is not aware of any such request. There is no legal basis which would permit releasing frozen funds to compensate victims of Qadhafi-sponsored IRA terrorism, and also no legal basis upon which the UK could withhold Libyan assets once the relevant Libyan entities are removed from the list and the assets unfrozen.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/746346","Department of Health","false","2017-07-03","<p>Decisions about local services should be made as close to patients as possible. General practitioners, as part of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), are best placed to co-ordinate the commissioning of high quality care for their patients. They ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local health care needs.</p><p> </p><p>The Department expects CCGs to assure themselves that they have satisfied their legal duties. As part of this, we would expect that commissioners have had due regard for staff development, innovations in treatment and advances in medical technologies, and the administrative costs of procurement exercises.</p><p> </p><p>Commissioners have the freedom and autonomy to take responsibility for meeting the needs of local patients and the public by working closely with secondary care, other health and care professionals and with community partners to design joined up services. The CCG has a budget of £250,000 for external advice and support to help them do this.</p><p> </p><p>In designing this contract, the CCG has conducted its own modelling and this has been referenced in the procurement notice. The ongoing partnership between the CCG and the Multispeciality Community Provider (MCP) will involve joint “horizon scanning” to identify emergent issues and agree how these will be managed.</p><p> </p><p>The services covered by the proposed scope of the MCP contract are all services currently contained within existing separate contracts, or other agreements, between the CCG and service providers or Dudley Council with service providers.</p><p> </p><p>A MCP removes artificial barriers between these existing providers, bringing them together to overcome fragmentation in the National Health Service and provide joined up care that is preventative, high quality and efficient. This will ensure it can deliver the coordinated care that is needed to the complex needs of a growing frail elderly population which do not fall neatly into discrete packages.</p><p> </p><p>Much of the MCP care model can be delivered in current contractual frameworks through closer working. However, there is an opportunity to make sure that contracting in a new way supports this integration and delivery of the care model. By awarding an MCP Contract, commissioners can ensure that the integrated working and aligned incentives that providers have built through the model are sustainable and that organisational siloes are truly</p><p>dissolved. The Whole Population Budget, a key tool for integration, can only be given to the MCP provider if they hold an MCP Contract.</p><p> </p><p>Within the MCP, the continuing professional development of the staff will be the responsibility of the MCP itself, as the provider and contract holder, not the CCG as the commissioner. The CCG has set out in its prospectus and in the questions it will use during the “dialogue” phase of the procurement its expectations of the MCP as a good employer and these will be tested out with bidders. The MCP contract moves from an adversarial style contract to a partnership based contract. As part of the developing relationship between the CCG and the MCP it may be appropriate for the CCG and the MCP to consider how the organisational development of the MCP is supported jointly.</p><p> </p><p>The CCG are also including staff representatives in the evaluation of the procurement bids.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England is responsible for assuring the performance of CCGs. If it believes that a CCG is failing or at risk of failing its statutory duties, it has powers to intervene.</p><p> </p><p>In November 2016 NHS England and NHS Improvement published details of a new Integrated Support and Assurance Process (ISAP).

In line with this, Dudley CCG undertook a full public consultation last summer to inform the development of the Multispecialty Community Provider (MCP) contract. NHS England has told us that the consultation exercise reached several thousand people (including staff) and received over 600 contributions.</p><p> </p><p>A report was commissioned from ICF Consulting Services on the consultation process and considered by Dudley CCG Board in September 2016. A copy of the report is available on the CCG’s website:</p><p><a href="http://www.dudleyccg.nhs.uk/mcpconsult" target="_blank">www.dudleyccg.nhs.uk/mcpconsult</a></p><p> </p><p>The local consultation followed a significant period of involvement with local people. In partnership with Healthwatch Dudley, Dudley CCG visited over 50 community groups. Dudley CCG have a patient representative on the Procurement Board, a group of representatives who have helped to shape the procurement questions and the CCG will continue to engage with them as they move through competitive dialogue.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley CCG has held regular staff briefings, with staff of all of the main organisations involved (including some staff representatives), over a period of several months. There is a further series of staff engagement events planned, with leaders across health and care giving presentations on what the MCP will mean.</p><p> </p><p>Further engagement has taken place with a range of local providers, including those outside Dudley which serve Dudley patients, and local voluntary sector bodies. All local providers, including the local hospital and mental health trust, are members of Partnership Board which has have developed the model of care for the MCP.</p><p> </p><p>The MCP Project Board reports on a monthly basis to Dudley CCG’s public Board meeting. Reports have been made to the Health and Wellbeing Board and the Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The issue features as a regular item at the CCG’s Healthcare Forum.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley CCG expects the MCP to operate in line with public service and National Health Service values. It will be expected to meet in public; be open and transparent; have effective means of securing patient and public involvement; and engage with the Council, the Health and Wellbeing Board and the Overview and Scrutiny Committee, as well as local communities and the voluntary sector.</p><p> </p><p>Before substantive service change can occur, we have been clear that there should be public consultation. NHS England has processes in place to ensure this. The Government has been clear that all significant service changes have to pass include an ability to demonstrate strong public and patient engagements.</p><p> </p><p>To date the Secretary of State for Health has received no representations from the Dudley Group of Hospitals on Dudley CCG’s contract for an MCP.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has set clear guidelines and tests to ensure that any significant reconfigurations have demonstrated strong public and patient engagements. Furthermore, those changes must be backed by a clear clinical evidence base and a credible plan to improve performance without affecting patient care.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/746360","Department of Health","false","2017-07-03","<p>Decisions about local services should be made as close to patients as possible. General practitioners, as part of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), are best placed to co-ordinate the commissioning of high quality care for their patients. They ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local health care needs.</p><p> </p><p>The Department expects CCGs to assure themselves that they have satisfied their legal duties. As part of this, we would expect that commissioners have had due regard for staff development, innovations in treatment and advances in medical technologies, and the administrative costs of procurement exercises.</p><p> </p><p>Commissioners have the freedom and autonomy to take responsibility for meeting the needs of local patients and the public by working closely with secondary care, other health and care professionals and with community partners to design joined up services. The CCG has a budget of £250,000 for external advice and support to help them do this.</p><p> </p><p>In designing this contract, the CCG has conducted its own modelling and this has been referenced in the procurement notice. The ongoing partnership between the CCG and the Multispeciality Community Provider (MCP) will involve joint “horizon scanning” to identify emergent issues and agree how these will be managed.</p><p> </p><p>The services covered by the proposed scope of the MCP contract are all services currently contained within existing separate contracts, or other agreements, between the CCG and service providers or Dudley Council with service providers.</p><p> </p><p>A MCP removes artificial barriers between these existing providers, bringing them together to overcome fragmentation in the National Health Service and provide joined up care that is preventative, high quality and efficient. This will ensure it can deliver the coordinated care that is needed to the complex needs of a growing frail elderly population which do not fall neatly into discrete packages.</p><p> </p><p>Much of the MCP care model can be delivered in current contractual frameworks through closer working. However, there is an opportunity to make sure that contracting in a new way supports this integration and delivery of the care model. By awarding an MCP Contract, commissioners can ensure that the integrated working and aligned incentives that providers have built through the model are sustainable and that organisational siloes are truly</p><p>dissolved. The Whole Population Budget, a key tool for integration, can only be given to the MCP provider if they hold an MCP Contract.</p><p> </p><p>Within the MCP, the continuing professional development of the staff will be the responsibility of the MCP itself, as the provider and contract holder, not the CCG as the commissioner. The CCG has set out in its prospectus and in the questions it will use during the “dialogue” phase of the procurement its expectations of the MCP as a good employer and these will be tested out with bidders. The MCP contract moves from an adversarial style contract to a partnership based contract. As part of the developing relationship between the CCG and the MCP it may be appropriate for the CCG and the MCP to consider how the organisational development of the MCP is supported jointly.</p><p> </p><p>The CCG are also including staff representatives in the evaluation of the procurement bids.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England is responsible for assuring the performance of CCGs. If it believes that a CCG is failing or at risk of failing its statutory duties, it has powers to intervene.</p><p> </p><p>In November 2016 NHS England and NHS Improvement published details of a new Integrated Support and Assurance Process (ISAP). The dual purpose of the ISAP is to guide the work of local commissioners and providers in creating successful and safe schemes and provide a means of assurance that this has happened.</p><p> </p><p>The ISAP process will test whether the contract will deliver value for money over the full duration of that contract, including an assessment of how the break clauses will work.</p><p> </p><p>The risk register is a live document which is held by Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group’s MCP Procurement Project Board. The Department does not keep a risk register for proposals made by individual CCGs.</p>","Winchester","Steve Brine","1667 ; 1668 ; 1669 ; 1670","2017-07-03T15:16:33.55Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/746360/answer","Biography information for Steve Brine","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/746360/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/746360/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-06-28","Health Services: Dudley","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what estimate has been made of drawing up and tendering the new contract proposed by Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group for a multi-speciality community provider in (a) management time, (b) legal fees, (c) consultancy fees and (d) other fees and costs; and what assessment has been made of the value for money of this financial provision.","false","Biography information for Ian Austin","Dudley North","Ian Austin","1671"
