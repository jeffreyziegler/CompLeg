It set out a clear framework for commissioners to reduce inpatient capacity by developing more community services for people with learning disabilities or autistic people with behaviour that challenges. The expectation was for a reduction in inpatient numbers of between 35 and 50% by March 2019.</p><p>By the end of April 2019, inpatient numbers had reduced by 22%. National Health Service planning guidance for 2019/20 requires a 35% reduction in inpatients compared to 2015 no later than the end of 2019/20. The LGA and ADASS, as key delivery partners of the Transforming Care programme, will continue to support work to improve provision of suitable accommodation and services in the community and the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Education will remain accountable for ensuring that children and young people receive the support they need.</p><p>The NHS Long Term Plan prioritises services for children and young people, providing a clear focus on improving the health and wellbeing of children and young people with learning disabilities and/or autism, as well as committing to implementing ‘Building the right support’ in full, achieving at least a 50% reduction in the number of people with a learning disability or autism who are inpatients, compared to the figure in 2015, by the end of 2023/24.</p><p>The Long Term Plan sets out specific commitments to achieve this by developing new models of care to provide care closer to home and investing in intensive, crisis and forensic community support. By 2023/24 children and young people with a learning disability, autism or both with the most complex needs will also have a designated keyworker. These will be initially provided to children and young people who are inpatients or at risk of being admitted to hospital.</p><p>Local health systems have been asked to develop plans for implementing the Long Term Plan’s commitments. These plans will be brought together in a national implementation programme for the Long Term Plan to 2023-24, and an NHS workforce implementation plan, by the end of 2019.</p>","Gosport","Caroline Dinenage",,"2019-05-23T10:14:02.773Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1127690/answer","Biography information for Caroline Dinenage","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1127690/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1127690/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-05-20","Psychiatric Hospitals: Children","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, with reference to the report entitled Far less than they deserve published by the Children’s Commissioner on 20 May 2019, what plans he has to  publish a national strategy to replace Transforming Care.","false","Biography information for Luciana Berger","Liverpool, Wavertree","Luciana Berger","256312"

All schools must notify the local authority when a pupil’s name is to be deleted from the admission register. There is no legal definition of ‘off-rolling’. However, the law is clear that a pupil’s name can only be deleted from the admission register on the grounds prescribed in regulation 8 of the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006, as amended.</p><p>Following media coverage of off-rolling in 2017, the Department wrote to all secondary schools, reminding them of the rules surrounding exclusion.</p><p>Ofsted already considers records of children taken off roll and has also recently consulted on proposals that will see a strengthened focus on this issue. From September 2019 where inspectors find off-rolling, this will always be addressed in the inspection report, and where appropriate will lead to a school’s leadership being judged inadequate.</p><p>In March 2018, the Government launched an externally-led review of exclusions practice, led by Edward Timpson CBE. The review explored how head teachers use exclusion, and why pupils with particular characteristics are more likely to be excluded from school. It also considered the differences in exclusion rates across primary and secondary schools in England.</p><p>The Timpson Review and the Government’s response were published on 7 May. The review makes 30 recommendations and highlights variation in exclusions practice across different schools, local authorities and certain groups of children. The Government has accepted all 30 recommendations in principle, and the Department has committed to working with education leaders over the summer to design a consultation on making schools accountable for the outcomes for permanently excluded children, to be launched in the autumn. As part of this, the Department will seek views on how to mitigate the potential unintended consequences Edward Timpson has identified in his review, including the practice of off-rolling.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2019-05-22T10:57:23.337Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1127282/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1127282/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1127282/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-05-17","Pupil Exclusions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to the Ofsted report entitled, Exploring the issue of off-rolling published on 10 May 2019, what steps he is taking to reduce the number of pupils illegitimately removed from schools.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","255650"

In addition, other factors include the time taken for the provider’s access and participation plan to be negotiated and approved, the likelihood of the provider to breach its ongoing conditions of registration, including the ways in which that would impact its students.

In addition, more timely decisions can be made where the risk assessment suggests that the provider is unlikely to breach any of its ongoing conditions of registration. Cases that have taken longer to assess have typically involved several attempts to obtain relevant information from the provider. The risk assessment also suggests either that the provider does not satisfy one or more initial conditions of registration (in which case the provider may make representations against the proposed decision to refuse registration), or that the provider may be at increased risk of breaching one or more of its ongoing conditions of registration once registered. In these cases, the OfS is likely to conclude that the interests of students are best protected by taking regulatory action with which the provider must comply, such as applying specific conditions of registration or enhanced monitoring arrangements.
