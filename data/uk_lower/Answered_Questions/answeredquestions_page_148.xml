There are carer “premiums” in income-related benefits, such as Income Support, Housing Benefit and Universal Credit. These amounts recognise the additional contribution and responsibilities associated with caring and mean that lower-income carers can receive more than others who receive these benefits.

A total of 28 policy professionals have undertaken this training through two workshops, since June 2017.</p><p> </p><p>Both the online and face-to-face workshops are included in the recommended learning for all civil servants working in a role related to EU exit.

Through four online tutorials, video interviews with senior civil servants, and ‘take back to the office’ activities, it explains how the different governments operating in the UK work together, covering devolution settlements, decentralisation, City Deals and intergovernmental relations, as well as the ‘Devolution Memorandum of Understanding and Supplementary Agreements’. 646 civil servants have engaged with the online training since it’s release:</p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p>Started</p></td><td><p>Completed</p></td><td><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Total Engagements</p></td></tr></tbody></table></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2018</p></td><td><p><strong>67 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>346 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>413 </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p><strong>53 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>171 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>224 </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016</p></td><td><p><strong>2 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>7 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>9 </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total</p></td><td><p><strong>122 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>524 </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>646 </strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>ii) The <strong>half day face-to-face Devolution &amp; Intergovernmental Working workshop </strong>is also available to all civil servants. Building on the above online module, delegates learn from experienced professionals who have worked on a range of devolution matters about topics such as confidentiality, when to seek legal advice and the boundaries of devolution, where reserved and devolved powers meet. A total of 28 policy professionals have undertaken this training through two workshops, since June 2017.</p><p>Both the online and face-to-face workshops are included in the recommended learning for all civil servants working in a role related to EU exit. The online learning is included in the new EU Essentials for Policy Professionals programme, for those new to policy making or the civil service; and the face-to-face workshop is included in the EU Policy Practitioner Programme for those with more policy experience. These programmes were launched in April 2018, with a total of 56 policy professionals undertaking the training programmes so far.</p><p> </p><p>iii) Also available to civil servants are the <strong>EU exit: devolution settlements and intergovernmental working events. </strong>Delegates hear the views of Permanent Secretaries, and other senior civil servants from the devolved administrations and territorial offices, on intergovernmental relations within the current political climate.</p><p>Seven of these events have been delivered to 96 attendees across three Departments, since March 2017.</p><p> </p><p>b) Fast Stream</p><p>Introduced in 2017 as part of <strong>Fast Stream policy learning</strong>, delegates take part in a Devolution workshop, which all brand new entrant centrally managed Fast Streamers attend as part of their Induction offer.

It aims to build devolution awareness and civil servant networks across the One Civil Service through shared learning and knowledge exchange throughout the year.</p><p>The <em>Devolution and You </em>programme enables civil servants to strengthen their skill sets and build open and positive relationships as they engage in complex discussions across the One Civil Service.

Landlords and agents raised concerns that a cap of four weeks’ rent may result in a behavioural change, encouraging tenants to forgo their final month’s rent payment and leave landlords with less flexibility to accept riskier tenants such as those with pets. It may result in an increased cost to landlords when their claim for damages or unpaid rent at the end of the tenancy is not fully covered by the deposit taken. Whilst it is difficult to assess these impacts, we rejected a cap of four weeks' or one months’ rent on that basis and have proposed to cap deposits at six weeks’ rent.</p><p>Analysis suggests that a cap of six weeks’ rent will result in around 14 per cent of deposits being reduced, which is estimated to result in an annual loss to landlords of £1.3 million.

The total EU contribution to the IPENS programme – which looked at all the major pressures on Natura 2000 sites - was €1,785,388. This included around £45,000 for evidence projects associated with the nitrogen theme plan, but it is not possible to distinguish the amount of funding for staff time in developing the SNAPs concept itself.</p><p> </p><p>The SNAPs approach is still at a pilot stage and some initial pilot work led by Natural England (NE) started in 2016. Although each SNAP does not necessarily need to be led by NE, over the next two years we expect NE area team staff to be involved in investigating the approach in at least eight areas where nitrogen emissions from different types of source are affecting Natura 2000 sites. This pilot work is being overseen by two NE senior specialists in air quality and supported by staff in each of the relevant area teams.</p><p> </p><p>By overall reduction in risk at the site level, declines in background reactive nitrogen concentrations through implementation of the Government’s approaches to meet targets under the National Emissions Ceiling Directive will contribute to SNAPs. So too will localised reductions in emissions, including those funded through Rural Development Programme for England schemes to reduce ammonia emissions from agriculture, as well as advice on efficient use of nitrogen and ammonia reduction measures through catchment sensitive farming (CSF). CSF is in the process of appointing 11 additional members of staff to work on aspects of ammonia reductions from farming, and to build capability in this area that will also contribute to meeting objectives under SNAPs.</p><p> </p><p>The pilot work is funded by Government under NE’s Grant in Aid allocation, but it is not readily possible to determine the specific time spent by our area teams on this aspect of NE’s site protection work at these Natura 2000 sites.
