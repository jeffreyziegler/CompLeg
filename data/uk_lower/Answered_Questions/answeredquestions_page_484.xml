The actuarial reduction rate applied to benefits accrued in the 2015 scheme would be 21.8 per cent at age 55, and 17.9 per cent at age 56, using today’s assumptions. This compares favourably with the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme 2006, where the reduction at age 55 is around 40 per cent, and at age 56 is around 38 per cent. All pension benefits built up by a member in their current scheme will be fully protected, calculated on their final salary, and can be taken on retirement from the member’s current pension age without actuarial reduction. On top of this, as set out in the recent consultation, our proposals include a significant reduction in employee contribution rates for firefighters transferring from the 1992 Scheme to the 2015 Scheme.

Instead, the Government guarantees the borrowing of approved housing providers in order to reduce the risk for lenders and therefore the risk for investors in lending to house builders. This lower risk leads to borrowers paying a lower interest rate and the schemes enable them to access more finance. As this finance is also cheaper, it leaves more money for the house builders in the schemes to plough back into house building.</p><p>There are two housing guarantee schemes: one to support the delivery of additional affordable homes, and one to support the delivery of large scale professionally managed purpose built accommodation for private rent. Both schemes run to 2016.</p><p>The Government will guarantee up to £10 billion of housing providers’ debt through the two schemes: up to £3.5 billion of guaranteed debt is available for affordable housing, up to £3.5 billion of guaranteed debt is available for the private rented sector and up to £3 billion of guarantee capacity is held in reserve. The debt on both schemes is to be raised primarily through a delivery partner. The debt can be in the form of loans, through the European Infrastructure Fund, or through bond issuance.</p><p>Under the Affordable Housing Guarantee Scheme, the Government has so far announced commitments to guarantee £633 million worth of debt for 16 housing providers, which together are expected to deliver 5,900 additional affordable homes.</p><p>On 30 May 2014, the first bond of the affordable housing guarantees scheme was issued by our delivery partner, Affordable Housing Finance backed by a full faith guarantee from Department for Communities and Local Government. With Government backing, this bond achieved the lowest price for debt in the affordable housing sector’s history and supported £208 million of the £633 million of approved borrowing. We are considering further proposals for credit and expect to announce further additional borrowers shortly.</p><p>Under the Private Rented Sector Guarantee scheme, the Government has been procuring a delivery partner and has been actively engaging with large borrowers interested in the scheme. We expect that a delivery partner when appointed will significantly increase access to the scheme and maximise the number of new build homes for private rent. We will be making further announcements on this scheme in due course.</p><p>In addition to this, the Build to Rent Fund provides development phase finance to large-scale private rented sector developments, delivering up to 10,000 new homes for private rent and demonstrating the viability of developing and investing in private rented sector developments. Eleven deals have so far been announced to date worth £151 million, which will deliver approximately 2,000 new homes for private rent. More schemes will be announced in due course.</p><p>Such institutional investment in private sector accommodation is dependent on an environment which is free of excessive regulation.

However, we do know that cancer survival and mortality rates continue to improve and we are developing proxy measures to assess progress in a more timely manner, particularly in terms of the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages one and two and cancers diagnosed through emergency routes.</p><p> </p><p>The National Health Service and Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators and the clinical commissioning group (CCG) Outcomes Indicator Set are starting to enable us to assess progress, at national and local level. For example, data on one-year survival from all cancers and one-year survival from breast, lung and colorectal cancer were published as part of the CCG outcomes indicator set for the first time on 19 June 2014.</p><p> </p><p>The Cancer Outcomes Strategy is backed with more than £750 million over the four year Spending Review period, including over £450 million to achieve early diagnosis. The additional money is funding over 2 million extra tests over four years and gives general practitioners (GPs) access to non-obstetric ultrasound – to support diagnosis of ovarian cancer; flexible sigmoidoscopy– to support the diagnosis of bowel cancer; and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans – to support the diagnosis of brain cancer. NHS England monitors the use of these tests through the Diagnostic Imaging Dataset. On 22 May 2014, NHS England published ‘Provisional Monthly Diagnostic Imaging Dataset Statistics' for the period from January 2013 to January 2014.</p><p> </p><p>Over 34.2 million imaging tests were reported in England in the 12 months from February 2013 to January 2014. Over a quarter of all tests that may have been used to diagnose or discount cancer were requested by GPs under direct access arrangements.</p><p> </p><p>The Mandate for the NHS for 2014-15 sets out an ambition for England to become one of the most successful countries in Europe at preventing premature deaths.</p><p> </p><p>Tackling premature deaths from cancer will contribute to this. A range of work at national and local level is aimed at improving cancer survival. For example, results from the first national “Be Clear on Cancer” lung cancer campaign in 2012 showed that around 700 extra patients were diagnosed with lung cancer compared to the previous year.

However, we do know that cancer survival and mortality rates continue to improve and we are developing proxy measures to assess progress in a more timely manner, particularly in terms of the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages one and two and cancers diagnosed through emergency routes.</p><p> </p><p>The National Health Service and Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators and the clinical commissioning group (CCG) Outcomes Indicator Set are starting to enable us to assess progress, at national and local level. For example, data on one-year survival from all cancers and one-year survival from breast, lung and colorectal cancer were published as part of the CCG outcomes indicator set for the first time on 19 June 2014.</p><p> </p><p>The Cancer Outcomes Strategy is backed with more than £750 million over the four year Spending Review period, including over £450 million to achieve early diagnosis. The additional money is funding over 2 million extra tests over four years and gives general practitioners (GPs) access to non-obstetric ultrasound – to support diagnosis of ovarian cancer; flexible sigmoidoscopy– to support the diagnosis of bowel cancer; and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans – to support the diagnosis of brain cancer. NHS England monitors the use of these tests through the Diagnostic Imaging Dataset. On 22 May 2014, NHS England published ‘Provisional Monthly Diagnostic Imaging Dataset Statistics' for the period from January 2013 to January 2014.</p><p> </p><p>Over 34.2 million imaging tests were reported in England in the 12 months from February 2013 to January 2014. Over a quarter of all tests that may have been used to diagnose or discount cancer were requested by GPs under direct access arrangements.</p><p> </p><p>The Mandate for the NHS for 2014-15 sets out an ambition for England to become one of the most successful countries in Europe at preventing premature deaths.</p><p> </p><p>Tackling premature deaths from cancer will contribute to this. A range of work at national and local level is aimed at improving cancer survival. For example, results from the first national “Be Clear on Cancer” lung cancer campaign in 2012 showed that around 700 extra patients were diagnosed with lung cancer compared to the previous year. Approximately 400 of these patients had their lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage, with around 300 more patients having surgery, giving them a better chance of survival.</p><p> </p><p>Work continues on extending and expanding the bowel, breast and cervical cancer screening programmes, and helping GPs to assess patients more effectively.

In the 2011 Autumn Statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that public sector pay awards will average at one per cent for the two years following the pay freeze.</p><p>The pay freeze took effect in MoJ (excluding NOMS) from August 2011 and MoJ exited the pay freeze on 1 August 2013. MoJ's pay arrangements from August 2013 target actions at the most pressing issues to ensure our proposals remain affordable within the 1% public sector pay cap whilst aiming to reward high performers, better enable recruitment and talent retention, and protect the lowest paid staff by improving their starting salaries.</p><p>NOMS have separate pay bargaining arrangements, linked to the Prison Service Pay Review Body. From 2010/11 - 2011/12 under the pay freeze NOMS were unable to increase the pay scales within its structures. However, NOMS has continued to honour annual pay progression increases for eligible staff (those who have not reached the maxima of the pay scale).</p><p> </p><p>In 2012, the Prison Service Pay Review Body and the Government endorsed NOMS' proposals to invest into reforming pay structures so that they are more fair and sustainable going forward. The review of NOMS' pay structures is based on data about the wider labour market (i.e., how levels of pay in NOMS compares to public and private sector labour markets), cost of living and inflation. From April 2012 new employees into NOMS, transfers into NOMS from Other Government Departments and those moving within NOMS on promotion are subject to the new pay and grading structures; those moving within NOMS on level transfer have an option to move across to the new structures.</p><p>The cost of providing information on the pay rise received by each official that has remained in grade and has received a pay rise in MOJ and NOMS would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold.</p><p> </p>","North West Cambridgeshire","Mr Shailesh Vara",,"2014-07-21T15:13:57.6032413Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77715/answer","Biography information for Mr Shailesh Vara","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77715/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77715/answer",,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2014-07-14","Pay","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many officials employed by his Department, of each grade, have remained at that grade since 2010 but received a pay rise; and how much of a rise each such person at each such grade has received.","false","Biography information for Mr Ben Bradshaw","Exeter","Mr Ben Bradshaw","205462"

This was calculated on the basis of the existing staffing requirements for the different operational functions.

This was then implemented carefully and transparently by individual Trusts, in consultation with their staff and the Unions locally.</p><p> </p><p>The Probation Association prepared guidance for its members on how Trusts should allocate their staff to the new organisations. This recommended that an automatic assignment process should be applied in the first instance, and where this was not possible then local evidence-based assignment criteria should be used. In those few situations where neither process led to allocation, and only in the case of administrative support staff, then the guidance allowed for agreement on transfer to be reached on the basis of a random assignment process. This was designed to ensure that staff in similar circumstances had an equal opportunity to be assigned to either of the new organisations.

All our employees are subject to the pay freeze and pay caps in place since 2010. In May 2010 the Government announced a two year pay freeze for civil servants earning over £21,000.

Additionally during 2010 the AA band minimum was increased by between £890 and £1060 (depending on location) which lead to a slightly higher increase for some staff. Following Cabinet Office rules, a small number who earned just over £21,000 received smaller payments, using a taper system, to ensure that they were not ‘leapfrogged’ by peers slightly lower down the pay scale.</p><p> </p><p>In 2012 and 2013 DWP awarded a 1% increase to the vast majority of our staff across all delegated grades.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77817","Home Office","false","2014-08-04","<p>It is not a requirement of the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision that a State provide prima facie evidence when issuing a warrant. Prima facie evidence was similarly not required under the previous extradition arrangements for countries within the EU - the European Convention on Extradition of 1957.The Government has legislated to reform the operation of the EAW and increase the protections for British citizens and others who are wanted for extradition. These safeguards, contained in the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, were commenced on 21 July 2014. These changes include the introduction of a proportionality bar. This requires a British judge to consider whether extradition would be disproportionate (and to discharge the person if it would be), taking into account the seriousness of the alleged conduct, the likely sentence the person would receive if convicted, and the possibility of the issuing State taking measures that would be less coercive than extradition. We have also addressed the concerns that relate to pre-trial detention. Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that decisions to charge and try the person have not been made, the issuing State must now prove that they have been (unless the only reason for this is the person's absence from the issuing State), or the judge is required to discharge the person. This will help ensure people are not extradited only to spend length periods in pre-trial detention whilst the issuing State continues to investigate the offence. In addition, to help deal with concerns relating to length pre-trial detention, it is now possible for an individual to be temporarily transferred to the issuing State or to speak with the authorities in that State by videoconference ahead of the extradition hearing the UK, if the person consents. We have also made the Extradition Act 2003 clearer with regard to the existing requirement for dual criminality; in particular, setting out that in cases where all or part of the conduct occurred in the UK, and the conduct is not criminalised here, the European Arrest Warrant must be refused for that conduct. The Government has also introduced (by way of the Crime and Courts Act 2013) a forum bar, to ensure that the possibility of a domestic prosecution has been properly explored as part of the extradition proceedings. The Government is satisfied that the UK’s transposition of the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision complies fully with the concept of Habeas Corpus.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",,"Lord Taylor of Holbeach",,"2014-08-04T13:16:49.0208929Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77817/answer","Biography information for Lord Taylor of Holbeach","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77817/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/77817/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-07-14","European Arrest Warrants","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether the new conditions for granting European Arrest Warrants will (1) require prima facie evidence to be produced, and (2) safeguard the right of habeas corpus.","false","Biography information for Lord Stoddart of Swindon",,"Lord Stoddart of Swindon","HL1114"

The new national curriculum will match those in the highest-performing education jurisdictions in the world, challenging pupils to realise their potential in an increasingly competitive global market.</p><p> </p><p>At primary level, we have published a more rigorous curriculum with a greater level of demand. In mathematics, children will know their times tables by age nine and calculators will be removed from the test for 11 year olds to ensure that children get a rigorous grounding in mental and written arithmetic. To support schools, we will continue to fund the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics. We also recently announced the establishment of 32 new Maths Hubs, supported with £11 million of funding over the next two years, which will drive up the quality of mathematics education from the early years to age 19.</p><p> </p><p>In the new English national curriculum we have placed a greater focus on grammar, spelling and punctuation, with a new test for 11 year olds. We have strengthened the requirements on learning to read through systematic synthetic phonics, and we have introduced a phonics screening check at age six so that teachers can intervene early to help children catch up.</p><p> </p><p>At secondary level, GCSEs in mathematics and English are also being reformed to be more challenging and give stronger guarantees of numeracy and literacy. We expect schools will increase time spent teaching mathematics – bringing us in line with our international competitors. The recently announced “Progress 8” measure gives double weighting to mathematics and English in performance tables for the first time. For year 7 pupils who have not achieved level 4 at key stage 2 in reading and/or mathematics we will continue to fund the catch-up premium worth £500 per pupil. This enables secondary schools to deliver additional support, such as individual tuition or intensive support in small groups, for those pupils that most need it.</p><p> </p><p>We are also reforming post-16 education, including A levels in English and mathematics, and have set out our ambition for the majority of young people in England to study mathematics at least to age 18 by 2020.
