NSRC staff do not differentiate between different categories of injury; all WIS are managed equitably with their recovery pathway being directed by doctors, physiotherapists, military Departments of Community Mental Health and Occupational Therapists. Not all personnel on a recovery pathway are due to receive medical discharge; 84% return to work.</p><p> </p><p>A total of 67 PROs are based within 11 Personnel Recovery Units (PRUs) across the UK and Germany; PRUs are military units established for the command and care of WIS soldiers with the greatest need. All Army WIS personnel have a dedicated PRO assigned to them, to assist them through the recovery process and co-ordinate support from other agencies. If the individual remains in their unit the PRO will be someone in the unit who has been assigned by their Commanding Officer.</p><p> </p><p>Soldiers are transferred to a PRU if their Chain of Command or unit recommend they need more help than the unit can provide. There are a number of reasons for this, such as the nature or severity of their injury or illness, the distance between the soldier’s home address and the unit (if the soldier is at home on recovery duty), or because the unit is due to deploy. The PRUs are not residential facilities, but are organised on a regional basis allowing soldiers to be transferred to the one closest to them.</p><p> </p><p>The RAF has two full time and two part-time PROs based in the Personnel Recovery Centre at RAF High Wycombe.</p><p> </p><p>RAF PROs are responsible for supporting WIS personnel through their recovery pathway and in support of their patient care whether they are returning to Service or being medically discharged. They encourage and, where necessary, direct WIS personnel to manage their own recovery pathway as much as they are able. RAF PROs become the line manager for WIS and provide mentoring, coaching and welfare support throughout their recovery.

As a State Party to the International Criminal Court Statute (ICC), the UK has made it a domestic crime to commit any of the crimes in the ICC Statute, including genocide.

Where prevention has failed, it is the international community's responsibility to take collective action, through diplomatic, humanitarian and other means. Where timely and decisive action to end, or prevent, the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes is necessary, the UK is active in calling for UN action. However, the Government believes that formal recognition that genocide has been committed is ultimately a matter for the courts, not political bodies.</p>",,"Baroness Anelay of St Johns",,"2016-06-13T13:15:52.737Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/522842/answer","Biography information for Baroness Anelay of St Johns","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/522842/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/522842/answer",,,,,,,,"16","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","Foreign and Commonwealth Office","2016-06-06","Business: Billing","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what procedures they have in place to identify the occurrence of genocide for the purposes of fulfilling their obligations as a contracting party under Article VIII of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide 1948; and whether there is a protocol in place to guide those procedures.","false","Biography information for Lord Alton of Liverpool",,"Lord Alton of Liverpool","HL393"

When discussing the public health impact of this condition, it is useful to distinguish between mild to moderate dental fluorosis and more severe fluorosis which is likely to be of concern from a cosmetic perspective, rather than overall levels.</p><p> </p><p>The study described in the paper by McGrady et al in 2012 photographed teeth in order to reducing potential examiner bias, a key recommendation of the York Review. The results might therefore not be directly comparable to the results of studies using older methodology.</p><p> </p><p>Public Health England’s 2014 water fluoridation health monitoring report was published subsequent to the responses given on 28 October 2013 and 5 December 2013 and included a section on dental fluorosis, drawing upon the 2012 report by McGrady et al. A copy of <em>Water Fluoridation Health Monitoring Report for England 2014</em> is attached.</p><p> </p><p>The report displayed the individual categories of dental fluorosis that were used in the 2012 report by McGrady et al, including the proportion who showed no signs of dental fluorosis in the two cities studied.

The proportion of children with dental fluorosis (TF score &gt;0) was 55% in Newcastle compared to 27% in Manchester. Fluorosis recorded at a level of TF3, considered to be mild or mild to moderate, was 6% in Newcastle and 1% in Manchester. The prevalence of higher scores (TF4 or greater) was very low in both cities.</p><p> </p><p>The methodology described in the 2012 paper by McGrady et al may give higher estimates of dental fluorosis compared to the direct examination by a dentist used in other surveys.
