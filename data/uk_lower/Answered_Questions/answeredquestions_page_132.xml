Since February 2018, Universal Credit claimants have been able to upload digital copies of their childcare cost receipts or invoices through their online Universal Credit account. Improvements in Universal Credit IT have also meant that most claimants reporting their in-month childcare costs are not asked to provide further evidence and are paid automatically with their Universal Credit award.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, claimants with a firm job offer can claim Universal Credit Childcare costs up to one month prior to starting work to enable their children to settle into a new routine. We also offer extra support to enable parents to pay upfront childcare costs or deposits: for example, claimants may be eligible to receive an advance of their future Universal Credit entitlement, which is interest free. Work coaches work with our claimants to ensure that, where this is taken up, repayments are affordable and manageable.</p><p> </p>","Reading West","Alok Sharma",,"2018-06-28T16:59:00.017Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/931048/answer","Biography information for Alok Sharma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/931048/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/931048/answer",,,,,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2018-06-25","Children: Day Care","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what support her Department provides to universal credit claimants who start a job with upfront childcare costs.","false","Biography information for Stephen Timms","East Ham","Stephen Timms","157015"

It is for the United States to decide when to seek election back onto the Council, but the UK is committed to working to strengthen the Council from within and will continue to set out the case for US engagement.
