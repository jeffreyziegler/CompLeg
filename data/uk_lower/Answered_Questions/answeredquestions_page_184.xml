No ACO contract will be awarded in the meantime.</p><p> </p><p>There is widespread support for ending the fragmented way that care has been provided to improve services for patients and the National Health Service has been working towards this in a number of ways. ACOs are just one of these ways and are intended to allow health and care organisations to formally contract to provide services for a local population in a coordinated way.</p><p> </p><p>An ACO is not a new type of legal entity and so would not affect the commissioning structure of the NHS. An ACO would simply be the provider organisation which is awarded a single contract by commissioners for all the services which are within scope for the local accountable care model. Therefore any proposal to award an ACO contract would engage local commissioners’ own duties under the NHS Act 2006. Any area seeking to use an ACO contract would need to comply with longstanding public procurement law.</p><p> </p><p>The consultation will set out how the contract fits within the NHS as a whole, address how the existing statutory duties of NHS commissioners and providers would be performed under it (including how this will work with existing governance arrangements), and will set out how public accountability and patient choice would be preserved.</p><p> </p><p>Subject to the outcome of the consultation, the two areas at the forefront of using a contract of this sort are Dudley, and Manchester’s proposed local care organisation. These are the only two areas that NHS England currently understands may be in a position to award an ACO contract during 2018. Emerging bidders for both proposals are NHS bodies, have the support of local general practitioners and are not private sector organisations. In two further areas, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) have launched procurement exercises for integrated service providers.

Other longer term contracts include service and performance review boards where the HMCTS Senior Business Owner and team will review the services delivered in month. They will then assure whether or not the deliverables have been delivered in line with the contract. Should the performance not meet the standards expected in the contract in accordance with the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) then HMCTS may have a right to service credits or other such remedy from the supplier.
