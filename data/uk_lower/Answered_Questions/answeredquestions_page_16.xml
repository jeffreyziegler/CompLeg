The Education Act 1996 also sets out the situations in which an absent pupil will not be taken to have failed to attend school regularly, such as where the child was prevented from attending due to illness.</p><p> </p><p>The Department recognises that mental health problems can have an impact on a pupil’s attendance and the guidance to schools is clear that they should authorise pupil absence due to illness (both physical and mental health related) unless they have genuine cause for concern about the veracity of an illness. If the authenticity of illness is in doubt, schools can request parents to provide medical evidence to support absence, but this is not mandatory.</p><p> </p><p>The statutory Special Educational Need and Disability Code of Practice sets out the approach that schools should take when staff notice an emerging issue, including mental health issues. Where more serious problems occur, schools should expect pupils and families to be able to access support from specialist services.</p><p> </p><p>Local authorities must arrange suitable full-time education for children of compulsory school age who, because of illness, would not receive suitable education without such provision. The Department’s statutory guidance states that local authorities should provide such education as soon as it is clear that a child will be away from school for 15 days or more, whether consecutive or cumulative.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb","284511 ; 284778","2019-09-05T16:32:23.747Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1143109/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1143109/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1143109/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-09-02","Truancy","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking to ensure that schools are consistent in their responses to cases of school refusal.","false","Biography information for Peter Kyle","Hove","Peter Kyle","284514"

It is essential that we grasp this issue, which is why the Criminal Justice Board (CJB) has committed to a cross-government end-to-end review of the Criminal Justice System’s (CJS) response to serious sexual violence and rape where the victim is over 18. We have established a Sub-Group of the CJB to oversee this review.</p><p> </p><p>The review is now well underway. The Cabinet Office have concluded initial analysis to identify key areas that merit further investigation. We are now gathering evidence and data from key groups and agencies across the CJS to enable us to better understand how handling and outcomes for rape cases could be improved. We continue to engage regularly with specialist stakeholders and victim organisations to ensure that the victim experience is central to our work.</p><p> </p><p>We have committed to publish a cross-system action plan at the conclusion of the review in Spring 2020.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1143243","Department for Education","false","2019-09-06","<p>The pupil premium is additional funding, worth over £2.4 billion in the current financial year, to help schools improve the progress and attainment of disadvantaged pupils. Allocations to schools are based on the number of pupils on roll at the time of the January school census who are currently registered for benefits-based free school meals (FSM) or who have been registered at any point in the last 6 years (known as ‘Ever 6 FSM’); or who are currently looked after, or have left local authority care in England or Wales through adoption or other specified routes. In 2019-20, 27.3% of all pupils in state-funded education in England attract pupil premium funding to the schools they attend.</p><p>The department knows that a significant proportion of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller of Irish Heritage (GRT) pupils qualify for the pupil premium. In 2017-18, 41.1% of GRT pupils at the end of key stage 2 and 33.7% at the end of key stage 4 were registered for FSM.</p><p>Nonetheless, the department is aware that there are concerns that some GRT pupils from financially disadvantaged family circumstances do not attract pupil premium funding to the schools they attend, because their parents choose not to apply for those benefits that would qualify their children for FSM. We encourage those parents who are eligible for qualifying benefits to take up the offer of support, so that all available resources can be brought to bear in improving the futures of all our young people.</p><p>It should also be noted that the pupil premium is not ring-fenced funding and schools have flexibility over how they use their allocations to address the needs of their pupils. This can include the implementation of whole school approaches that will improve the progress and attainment of all pupils, as well as being particularly beneficial for those pupils who are formally classed as disadvantaged and attract pupil premium funding. We actively encourage schools to adopt evidence-based approaches to their pupil premium spending, and to look at the pupil premium guide recently produced by the Education Endowment Foundation on how to maximise the impact of the funding.
