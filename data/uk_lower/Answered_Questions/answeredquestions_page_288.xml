In secondary schools, cookery is now compulsory and children are taught to cook a range of healthy and nutritious meals. They are equipped with knowledge about healthy eating and what is meant by a balanced diet. Physical education (PE) is compulsory at all four key stages and should provide opportunities for pupils to become physically confident in a way that supports their health and fitness.</p><p> </p><p>The new national curriculum also made financial literacy statutory for the first time.

The national curriculum for mathematics has also been strengthened to give pupils from 5 to 16 the necessary mathematical skills they need to make important financial decisions.</p><p> </p><p>Financial education can also be addressed more broadly as part of extra-curricular activities.

As a result, the percentage of all smokers quitting successfully each year has increased over the last five years.</p><p> </p><p>The best way to quit smoking is with a combination of behavioural support and pharmacotherapy. Specialist stop smoking services remain highly effective and cost effective and smokers who use them are up to four times as likely to quit successfully as if they try to quit unaided. Smokers who use English stop smoking services are up to four times as likely to quit successfully.<sup>1</sup></p><p> </p><p>Advice from a healthcare professional (HCP) is the most commonly cited external trigger for a quit attempt and therefore HCPs have a vital role to play. A new national Commissioning for Quality and Innovation indicator incentivises National Health Service trusts to identify smokers, provide advice and refer all those who are willing into specialist quitting support. Free online training, commissioned by Public Health England (PHE), is available for HCPs on delivering very brief advice on smoking.
