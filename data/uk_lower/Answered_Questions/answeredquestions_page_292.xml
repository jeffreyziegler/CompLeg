They can also access 'Royal Navy Jobs' which lists all available posts relevant to their branch, specialisation and rank, and also wider Common Appointment roles. This indicates an approximate estimation of when the post is due to become vacant. However, the selection of personnel for particular overseas postings is delivered through routine career management.</p><p>Army personnel can view and consider available opportunities via a vacancy list which is published on the Defence Intranet. In addition, soldiers have access to their Chain of Command (CoC) including their Regiment Career Management Officer (RCMO) who can provide advice on overseas postings and career implications. Officers have access to their CoC including unit Adjutants as well as their Career Managers. Overseas operational opportunities are often advertised through a trawl process where volunteers are sought for vacancies which are advertised on Part 1 Orders via the Regimental Unit Administrative Office.</p><p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) utilises different methods to make personnel aware of available overseas posts, depending on whether the post is for Air or Ground personnel. When an overseas Air post needs to be filled, all suitably qualified individuals are contacted by RAF Manning via their CoC and invited to register an interest, from which the post is filled. This method works best as it is focussed on specialised areas (such as Typhoon pilots), rather than a general trawl for personnel.

This expansion will ensure Defence continues to offer education opportunities to match career progression, further aiding retention.</p><p>A growing economy with reducing unemployment, growing numbers of job vacancies and a historical national shortage of STEM skills (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths), means the MOD cannot take the retention of its highly skilled Service personnel for granted. In response the Department and each of the Services have put in place a large body of retention-positive measures. These include: developing and improving employment frameworks and career structures to make the most of technical and niche-skilled personnel; improving promotion and career prospects; increasing Extensions of Service; increasing the opportunities to re-train and re-trade; improving the availability of internal transfers between Services and from Regular to Reserve; and targeted Financial Retention Incentives.</p><p>In addition to these targeted measures there are also a number of programmes in place that seek to improve the general offer and the support available to all Service personnel.</p>","Milton Keynes North","Mark Lancaster",,"2016-12-05T16:18:45.687Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647132/answer","Biography information for Mark Lancaster","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647132/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647132/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2016-11-28","Armed Forces: Training","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what steps his Department plans to take to improve the (a) upskilling and (b) retention once upskilled of service personnel.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","55262"

The MOD continues to work on a number of initiatives to provide job readiness and tailored employability support that focus on removing barriers that hinder spouses and partners finding employment. The Armed Forces Families Strategy, launched in January 2016, places partner employment as a priority and will look to how the MOD can influence the relationship between partner employment and the retention of Service personnel.</p><p> </p><p>The MOD’s Partner Employment Programme has three pillars:</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Spousal Employment Support Trial</strong> – this provides tailored employment and employability support, on a two year trial basis from October 2015, and is administered by Right Management Limited as part of the wider Career Transition Partnership (CTP) Contract. The trial is currently taking place overseas in Cyprus for 240 spouses and across several Royal Air Force locations in the UK for 200 spouses. The trial is ahead of schedule for enabling 440 spouses/partners to take up the opportunity of a £879 training grant.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Wolverhampton Business Start Up Programme </strong>– “Supporting the Unsung Hero” is a business start-up programme specifically designed for Armed Forces families. It provides transferrable skills and the ability to start a business over a 10 month programme for Service personnel, spouses and dependents of Regulars/Reserves and Veterans. Courses have been delivered both in the UK and overseas. By the end of phase two 199 course participants had set up their own business. The programme received two grants of LIBOR funding totalling £324,000 and subsequent support of £606,000 from HSBC to continue this work until 2020.</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>Royal British Legion Industries </strong></em><strong>Lifeworks Families</strong> – LIBOR funding of £241,000 provides Employability coaching services to develop key skills, CV writing, increase confidence and motivation and identify career and training opportunities. Over three years this initiative has assisted over 750 spouses and dependants across UK, Germany and Cyprus of serving/recently discharged Regulars and Reserves. The programme will continue until 2019 post LIBOR funding, with funding secured from the Royal British Legion, Annington Homes and Greenwich Hospital.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to these three pillars, Defence Relationship Management (DRM) continues to increase the number of organisations and employers making the pledge to support the Armed Forces Covenant (there are currently over 1,300 signatories).

For some women there may be no other treatment option. Since it was authorised, valproate was known to have risks in pregnancy. Because of ongoing concerns about women’s awareness of the risks, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has worked with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and patient groups to develop a set of materials to aid communication between health professionals and women and girls. The valproate toolkit comprises booklets for healthcare professionals, a reminder card and a guide for women, a checklist for prescribers and clear package labelling carrying a prominent warning about use in pregnancy.</p><p> </p><p>In order to monitor the effectiveness of the valproate toolkit, the MHRA has sought feedback from all stakeholders and will continue to work with the Royal Colleges, professional bodies, patient groups and relevant charities to increase awareness of the toolkit among general practitioners, pharmacists and patients. The MHRA’s current priority is working to ensure that women taking valproate are fully aware of the risks in pregnancy. Once this is achieved we will look back and see what lessons have been or could be usefully learnt by examining events.</p>","Oxford West and Abingdon","Nicola Blackwood",,"2016-11-30T16:53:44.357Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/644332/answer","Biography information for Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/644332/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/644332/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-11-25","Pregnancy: Sodium Valproate","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what the implications are for his policies of the decision by the French parliament to establish a national compensation fund for people affected by the teratogenic effects of sodium valproate.","false","Biography information for Norman Lamb","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb","54957"

This performance has been down to the hard work of local authorities and residents to recycle more. Around 99% of local authorities covering 97% of households (low rise and flats) in England offer a collection service for plastic bottles. Seventy-two per cent of local authorities covering 67% of households also offer a collection service for plastic packaging (pots, tubs and trays).</p><p> </p><p>The Government recognises that there are still challenges and is working with the Waste and Resource Action Programme (WRAP) to improve the recyclability of plastics and to help residents to recycle more. WRAP recently published new recycling guidelines agreed with local authorities, waste management companies and reprocessors. These set out in detail what can and cannot be collected for recycling and how householders can help to reduce contamination and increase recycling, including plastics recycling.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has also been working with WRAP on developing and delivering activities in support of the use of recycled plastics in new products, and on activities to stimulate demand. For example, the Plastics Industry Recycling Action Plan has identified key actions that need to take place across the whole supply chain to ensure that recycling plastics packaging can be done sustainably. This includes design for recyclability, collections and sorting, reprocessing and development of sustainable end markets.</p><p> </p><p>In September this year, WRAP and an industry advisory group published a framework for greater consistency in recycling collections. This framework aims to identify opportunities to rationalise packaging formats (in particular plastic packaging) to those that are recyclable and for which there is a steady market and to help local authorities to recycle a greater variety of plastics. A working group from this project is looking at the opportunities to rationalise plastic packaging, where practical and environmentally sensible to do so. This includes new communications materials and messages from Recycle Now and work on developing new end markets and applications for recycled plastics.

The NHS does extensive preparation for winter every year and takes such preparations very seriously. This year, for example, NHS England has made provision for winter preparedness funding of £400m, and has launched with Public Health England a national campaign to help guide patients and the public on how to keep healthy and safe during the winter season. Flu vaccinations have also begun earlier than in recent years, with over 5 million jabs having already been administered. As part of this, for the first time ever, children in year 3 will be offered the flu vaccine – meaning an additional 600,000 children will be protected this winter, making this the largest flu vaccination programme to date. The Department of Health is also working with the NHS and social care leaders to deliver the A&amp;E Improvement Plan and ensure that appropriate staffing levels are in place throughout the Christmas and New Year periods. Additionally, the Cold Weather Plan brings together national and local government, NHS England and the social care system to reduce cold-related harm. The Government also provides Winter Fuel Payments, Cold Weather Payments and the Warm Home Discount to help the elderly and vulnerable keep warm over winter. More broadly, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer outlined at the Autumn Statement, the Government remains committed to the spending plans for the NHS outlined at the Spending Review 2015. The NHS will receive £10 billion a year more in government funding by 2020-21 than in 2014-15.
