While the decision to close a branch remains a commercial judgement for individual banks and building societies, the impact on communities must be understood, considered and mitigated where possible.</p><p>The industry’s Access to Banking Standard, launched in May 2017, commits banks and building societies to ensure personal and business customers are better informed about branch closures and the reasons for them closing, along with the options they have locally to continue to access banking services, including specialist assistance for customers who need more help. The Access to Banking Standard is monitored and enforced by the independent Lending Standards Board.</p><p>99% of banks’ personal and 95% of banks’ business customers are now able to withdraw cash, deposit cash and cheques, and make balance enquiries at a Post Office counter via its network of 11,600 branches.

Friend the Chancellor announced at Autumn Budget 2017 that he was freezing all alcohol duties. Pubs play an important role in local communities and help promote responsible drinking. Freezing beer duty rates this year helps pubs: the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimate around two thirds of the alcohol sold in pubs is beer. At Spring Budget 2017, the Chancellor announced a package of support for pubs in England with their business rates. This provided a £1,000 discount to all pubs with a rateable value of less than £100,000. This scheme was extended by an additional year into 2018/19 at Autumn Budget.</p><p>Additionally, the Chancellor brought forward the planned switch in the indexation of business rates from RPI to CPI by two years to 2018. This will benefit all businesses on the UK high street and represents a cut in business rates every year from April 2018.

Also, in October 2017 the Home Secretary announced £200,000 of Home Office funding for a new national hub that will be run by police officers for the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) to help the police to tackle the emerging threat of online hate crime. <br>The Home Secretary has asked Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of the Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services to carry out inspection work on hate crime to build a national picture of how effectively and efficiently police forces deal with all five strands of hate crime, including that committed online. <br>However, it is also right that some of our activities address hate crimes targeted at specific groups.

The maternal and neonatal health safety collaborative was launched on 28 February 2017 and 44 wave 1 trusts have attended intensive training on quality improvement science and are working on implementing local quality improvement projects with regular visits from a dedicated quality improvement manager; and 25 trusts were successful in their bids for a share of the £250,000 maternity safety innovation fund and have been progressing with their projects to drive improvements in safety.</p><p> </p><p>The majority of maternity care providers are now implementing all four elements of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle, which recommends four key elements of evidence-based care and practice: reducing smoking in pregnancy, risk assessment and surveillance for fetal growth restriction, raising awareness of reduced fetal movement and effective fetal monitoring during labour. The Department has also funded the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford to develop a national standardised Perinatal Mortality Review Tool to support local perinatal death reviews.</p><p> </p><p>On 28 November 2017, my Rt. hon. Friend the Secretary of State published ‘Safer Maternity Care, The National Maternity Safety Strategy - Progress and Next Steps’, which set out a series of additional measures and made clear his intention to bring forward the national ambition to halve the rates of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries that occur during or soon after birth from 2030 to 2025.</p><p> </p><p>From April 2018, every case of a stillbirth, neonatal death, suspected brain injury or maternal death that is notified to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ (RCOG) ‘Each Baby Counts’ programme, about 1,000 incidents annually, will be investigated independently, with a thorough, learning-focused investigation conducted by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch. The new independent maternity safety investigations will involve families from the outset, and they will have an explicit remit not just to get to the bottom of what happened in an individual instance, but to spread knowledge around the system so that mistakes are not repeated.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, the Department has provided funding for the RCOG to launch 'Each Baby Counts Learn and Support' - a programme of work to enable greater collaboration between the Royal Colleges and the NHS via the Maternal and Neonatal Health Safety Collaborative - the aim is to align quality and safety improvement, multi-professional learning and clinical leadership into a consistent and sustainable safety strategy across the system. The Department is also providing new funding to train health practitioners, such as maternity support workers, to deliver evidence-based smoking cessation according to appropriate national standards.</p><p> </p><p>Further information about the additional measures in place to achieve the ambition and reduce stillbirths can be found here in the National Maternity Safety Strategy:</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662969/Safer_maternity_care_-_progress_and_next_steps.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662969/Safer_maternity_care_-_progress_and_next_steps.pdf</a></p>","Thurrock","Jackie Doyle-Price","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/820903/answer",,,,,,"2018-01-17T16:29:44.853Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/820903/answer","Biography information for Jackie Doyle-Price","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/820903/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-01-11","Perinatal Mortality","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps he has taken to reduce the occurrence of still-births.","false","Biography information for Laura Smith","Crewe and Nantwich","Laura Smith","122321"

The Case closure process involves sending the customer 3 letters over the case closure journey to instigate, remind and confirm liability is ending, enabling the customer to make alternate arrangements over the period. .</p><p> </p><p>At end of liability, clients are told that their Child Support Agency child maintenance arrangement has ended. The Non Resident Parent will be told when to make a final maintenance payment and to keep paying any arrears. The Child Support Agency (CSA) will continue to collect and pay arrears payments that are made prior to the case fully closing - but regular maintenance collections and payments will stop after a 6 month fixed period.</p><p> </p><p>When liability has ended the case enters “arrears cleanse”. The purpose of this period (which may take up to a further 6 months) is to examine the debt balances on the case to address any anomalies and so calculate a “stable” arrears figure. This involves reviewing any suspended and deferred debt. It includes the write off of debt in circumstances covered by existing debt write off powers.</p><p> </p><p>A case can only close once all arrears have been cleared or collected. For those cases where the child maintenance liability ended on or after 1<sup>st</sup> April 2014 as part of this process the average length of time for the Department to close a case was 27 weeks, this is based on data up 31<sup>st</sup> September 2017. The department aims to end liability on all Child Support Agency cases by 31 December 2018.</p><p> </p><p>In terms of targets, the department have a clear timeline for ending liability for individual cases 6 months after selection but there time taken to actually close the case will be dependant on the arrears position and the amount of work outstanding.. Whilst there are no specific targets for the process of closing cases once liability has ended, for most cases this should be around 6 months, and the exact time will depend on case circumstances.
