Article 20 sets out the circumstances in which it may be appropriate to restrict the right of entry or residence to such an EU citizen or their family member.</p><p> </p><p>The draft Withdrawal Agreement does not protect those who are not exercising or are misusing free movement rights, and it means that, while free movement rules continue to operate to the end of the planned implementation period, there will remain scope, consistent with the relevant case law, for a person to be removed from the UK on those grounds. It is logical that this is reflected in the Immigration Rules and published caseworker guidance for the EU Settlement Scheme, as it is in the provisions of and published caseworker guidance for the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 which provide for the operation in the UK of the Free Movement Directive (2004/83/EC).

The 2017-18 Violence Against Women and Girls report highlighted a 9.1% fall in referrals of rape flagged cases from the police to the CPS and work is being undertaken to understand the reasons behind this trend. Prosecutors are increasingly using the process of Early Investigative Advice to work with the police early to see what can be done to strengthen the prosecution when it is needed.</p><p>Rape investigations are becoming increasingly complex due to a number of factors, including the growth in relevant digital communications evidence. To address the increasing complexity of cases the CPS have introduced new guidance to help police and prosecutors with reasonable lines of inquiry and communications evidence. There has also been a significant recruitment exercise, which was completed to ensure that RASSO units were equipped to meet the substantial increase in the volume of case referrals from the police. Between July 2015 and October 2018, the number of specialist prosecutors in RASSO units rose by 52% from 138 to 210, with overall staffing in these units increasing by more than a third.</p><p>There has been no change of approach or guidance to CPS prosecutors in their commitment towards the prosecution of rape offences. The CPS has undertaken extensive work over the last decade to ensure that specialist prosecutors are fully equipped to deal with the particular complexities of rape and serious sexual offences and that the Code for Crown Prosecutors is properly applied.
