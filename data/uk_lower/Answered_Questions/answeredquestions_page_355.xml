The Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT) programme includes training for professionals working in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) partnerships to put the patient at the centre of their treatment: young people agree goals and milestones with the professional, and participate in their care through regular feedback and outcome monitoring. The benefits of this approach are well-evidenced.</p><p> </p><p>Unlike the adult programme, CYP IAPT does not create new services; it transforms CAMHS partnerships by training people to deliver evidence-based interventions so that those working in CAMHS do so in collaboration with children, young people and families, in every aspect of care and service design through better participation and regular feedback and outcome monitoring.</p><p> </p><p>At present, 78% of young people aged under 19 are covered by CAMHS partnerships which are working to transform services by embedding the CYP IAPT principles, and the programme is being rolled out to cover the whole of England by 2018. The programme is currently developing a number of new curricula to address training gaps that have been identified during its implementation.

It also noted that if all hours of care provided by unpaid carers to people with mental health issues were instead provided by paid staff, the cost would be approximately £14 billion (this is included in the £34 billion total).</p><p> </p><p>The Taskforce report is available at:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/mentalhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2015/09/fyfv-mental-hlth-taskforce.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/mentalhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2015/09/fyfv-mental-hlth-taskforce.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p>Separately, a 2013 report by the Office of National Statistics valued informal care provided in the United Kingdom at £61.7 billion per year (as an output of household production), although it is not possible to identify within this unpaid care specifically provided to people with mental health issues.</p><p> </p><p>The Government recognises the invaluable contribution made by unpaid carers and the importance of supporting them in their caring roles. We have also made an additional £400 million available to the National Health Service between 2011 and 2015 to provide carers with breaks from their caring responsibilities to sustain them in their caring role.

Table 1, below, provides collated figures for the last ten years, for pupils attending state-funded primary and secondary schools. These figures include children in resourced provision or SEN units but not children in special schools. There will be children whose primary need is not ‘hearing impairment’ but who, nevertheless, have a hearing impairment. These children are not covered by this information.</p><p>From September 2014 the ’SEN support’ category replaced the ’school action’ and ‘school action plus’ categories. Those recoded, in 2015, as having ‘SEN support’ but who were formerly included in the ‘school action’ category will not previously have had a primary type of need recorded. This is likely to have contributed to the large increase – between 2014 and 2015 – in the numbers of children recorded as having a hearing impairment.</p><p>The Department does not collect statistics

Compared to the year ending March 2010, in the year ending March 2015 there were 67% fewer first-time entrants to the youth justice system. However, reoffending rates are far too high and the care and supervision of young offenders in custody us not good enough. That is why the Justice Secretary has asked Charlie Taylor to conduct a review of youth justice. He will report back later this year with recommendations on how to improve the treatment of young people in our care.</p><p> </p><p>Table 1 below shows the latest available data on the number of defendants, in the requested age groups, proceeded against at magistrates’ courts and found guilty at all courts of exposure in England and Wales.</p><p> </p><p>Table 2 below shows the latest available data on the number of defendants, in the requested age groups, proceeded against at magistrates’ courts for offences relating to harassment in England and Wales.</p><p>Table 3 below shows the latest available data on the number of defendants, in the requested age groups, found guilty at all courts for offences relating to harassment in England and Wales.</p><p>Table 4 below shows the latest available data on the number of defendants, in the requested age groups, proceeded against at magistrates’ courts and found guilty at all courts of sexual offences in England and Wales.</p><p> </p><p>Court proceedings data for 2015 is planned for publication in May 2016.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="7"><p><strong>Table 1: Defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts of exposure <sup>(1)</sup>, England and Wales, 2010 to 2014 <sup>(2)(3)</sup></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Outcome</p></td><td><p>Age group</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"><p>Proceeded against</p></td><td><p>10 to 15</p></td><td><p>32</p></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16 to 17</p></td><td><p>42</p></td><td><p>35</p></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>32</p></td><td><p>22</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18 to 25</p></td><td><p>203</p></td><td><p>190</p></td><td><p>151</p></td><td><p>187</p></td><td><p>212</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>All 25 and under</p></td><td><p>277</p></td><td><p>244</p></td><td><p>195</p></td><td><p>232</p></td><td><p>250</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"><p>Found guilty</p></td><td><p>10 to 15</p></td><td><p>22</p></td><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16 to 17</p></td><td><p>36</p></td><td><p>26</p></td><td><p>23</p></td><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18 to 25</p></td><td><p>143</p></td><td><p>134</p></td><td><p>123</p></td><td><p>131</p></td><td><p>162</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>All 25 and under</p></td><td><p>201</p></td><td><p>174</p></td><td><p>157</p></td><td><p>155</p></td><td><p>189</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>(1) An offence under S66 Sexual Offences Act 2003</p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><p>(2) The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.

Designed across four levels, for both primary and secondary pupils, it offers opportunities for young people to compete at school and regional levels with the most talented going on to compete at a national level. Level 2 of the framework is focused on activities for inter-school competitive sport. There are over 20,000 schools taking part in this programme.
