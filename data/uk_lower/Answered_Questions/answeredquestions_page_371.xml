In doing so, CCGs must ensure that arrangements are in place for providers, irrespective of whether they are public, independent or third sector organisations, to qualify and secure NHS Standard Contracts for the provision of services.</p><br /><p>When making commissioning decisions, commissioners should regularly review the patterns and trends of patients exercising their legal right to choice, and consider the extent to which they are meeting patients’ needs and preferences and take account of this in their commissioning plans and strategies.</p><br /><p>CCGs are required by the NHS Planning Guidance (2016/17 – 2020/21) to produce five-year Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STP) and one-year Operational Plans. The STP will include plans for a radical upgrade in patient choice and control, which will significantly improve patient choice by 2020.</p><br /><p>CCGs are required to submit these plans to NHS England for review and assurance. The NHS England choice team are part of this process.</p><br /><p>To support commissioners, referrers and providers, NHS England published guidance on <em>‘implementing patients’ legal rights to choose the provider and team for their mental health care’,</em> in August 2014. The guidance seeks to promote a common understanding of what mental health patients’ legal rights are, where they apply, and what they mean in everyday practice. The guidance should enable consistency in the application of these rights, while also acknowledging the need for clinical judgments and decisions according to the circumstances of individual patients.</p><br /><p>Following the release of the guidance, the NHS England choice team has responded to a number of patient, provider and commissioner queries and concerns regarding choice. Detailed work with local economies and partners such as Monitor, has been undertaken to address concerns, with any resulting learning being shared with the sector to improve the operation of choice in other localities.</p><br /><p>There is also information on the NHS Choices website, which covers all aspects of exercising choice in mental health services. It explains patients’ legal rights, what this will mean in terms of what the process should be, where to find information, helpful checklists and a number of useful links.

The review concluded that there was good evidence that WASH has an impact on under-nutrition. At the very basic level, the act of infant and child feeding needs good personal hygiene – hand washing with soap and water, plus good food hygiene. In addition, water is important in that it is generally required to prepare complementary foods. It needs to come from a safe source and then be collected, transported and stored safely. The living environment of infants has to be free from faecal contamination to minimise the risk of ingesting pathogens or coming into contact with intestinal worms.</p><p>This review is currently being updated drawing on a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2014 which estimated that 50% of child under-nutrition is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections as a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. There is increasing evidence that chronic diarrheal disease may inhibit nutrient absorption even if sufficient food is consumed. This latter condition referred to as Environmental Enteropathy is currently one of the subjects of a large randomised control trial being conducted in Zimbabwe with DFID support.</p>",,"Baroness Verma",,"2016-01-28T17:00:32.337Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/444876/answer","Biography information for Baroness Verma","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/444876/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/444876/answer",,,,,"20","International Development","International Development","2016-01-14","Developing Countries: Malnutrition","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of the relationship between malnutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene.","false","Biography information for Lord McColl of Dulwich",,"Lord McColl of Dulwich","HL5074"

The guidance makes clear that school staff have a responsibility to provide children a safe environment in which they can learn. The guidance also sets out that schools should consider how children are taught about safeguarding, including online safeguarding, through teaching and learning opportunities, as part of a broad and balanced curriculum. We are currently consulting on further strengthening the online safety requirement for schools, to require all schools to have appropriate filters and monitoring systems in place with regards to the schools IT system.</p><p>Every school is required by law to have a behaviour policy with measures in place to prevent all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying. We have produced advice for schools on tackling bullying and advice for parents on how to prevent their child from being cyberbullied, as well as how to spot signs that they have been targeted and what steps to take. We are providing £1.3m in 2015-16 to anti-bullying charities to tackle all forms of bullying.</p><p>The Government Equalities Office is funding the UK Safer Internet Centre to produce advice for schools on how to keep children safe online. This advice will be available in the spring of 2016.</p><p>E-safety has been a statutory requirement within the new computing programme of study since September 2014. The introduction of e-safety content in key stages 1 and 2 reflects the fact that children are increasingly accessing the internet from a young age, and is intended to inform pupils of good practice in staying safe online from an early age.</p><p>The Government has encouraged Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide parents with the ability to easily filter content in the home. The four major ISPs, BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media, which together constitute an estimated 90% of the UK’s broadband market, have delivered on their commitment to provide an unavoidable choice on whether to install family friendly network level filters to their customers.</p><p>We expect social media companies to have robust processes in place to address inappropriate and abusive content on their sites. This includes having clear reporting channels, acting promptly to assess reports, and removing content which does not comply with their acceptable use policies or terms and conditions.
