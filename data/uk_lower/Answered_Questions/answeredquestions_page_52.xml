A communications campaign will launch later this year to raise awareness of T levels, where they can lead, and how they fit in with other post-16 choices.</p><p>Alongside the introduction of T levels, we are reviewing post-16 qualifications at level 3 and below, excluding A levels and GCSEs. The aim is to simplify the qualifications landscape so all qualifications are necessary, have a clear purpose, are high quality and have clear links to further study or employment. The first stage of the review, launched on 19 March, asks for views on defining these principles further. We are also reviewing how higher technical education (at levels 4 and 5) can better address the needs of students and employers. This includes ensuring that there is widespread clarity and confidence that qualifications at this level deliver the skills employers need.</p><p>We have also made £170 million funding available through our competition to establish Institutes of Technology (IoTs) across England. IoTs will be a new kind of prestigious and high quality institution, drawing on the strengths of FE colleges, universities and leading employers to deliver higher level technical training tailored to the specific skills needs of local areas. We will announce the outcome of the competition shortly and expect the first IoTs to open in the 2019/20 academic year.</p>","Guildford","Anne Milton",,"2019-04-10T16:30:36.07Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1109956/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1109956/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1109956/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2019-04-05","Vocational Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking to (a) improve, (b) promote and (c) expand technical and vocational education and training.","false","Biography information for Sir John Hayes","South Holland and The Deepings","Sir John Hayes","241399"

This will mean that, by March 2021, most women will receive continuity of the person caring for them during pregnancy, during birth and postnatally. Within this, 75% of women from black and minority ethnic groups and disadvantaged communities will have continuity of carer by the end of 2023-24, as the evidence suggests that it particularly improves outcomes for this group.</p><p> </p><p>We also aim to improve safety by rolling out the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle to every maternity unit in England in 2019.

Through this, we are supporting a culture of multidisciplinary team working and learning, vital for safe, high-quality maternity care.

That is why EU staff in health and social care have had early access to the EU Settlement Scheme since December 2018, allowing them to secure their rights to live and work in the United Kingdom. In March 2019, we put in place legislation that ensures the continued recognition of qualifications from EU countries by all professional regulators covering the health and social care sectors. This means EU staff who are currently practising in the UK can continue to do so, and that professionals qualified in the European Economic Area and Switzerland can continue to apply for registration after ‘exit day’, even if we leave without a ‘deal’.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, the NHS Long Term Plan sets out a vital strategic framework to ensure that over the next 10 years the National Health Service will have the staff it needs, so that nurses and doctors can administer the expert compassionate care they are committed to providing.

For the future relationship, the Future Security Partnership would enable strong operational capabilities to tackle serious crime and terrorism: swift and effective data exchange; fast-track surrender arrangements; and continued close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust.</p><p>In a no deal scenario, the UK would no longer be able to cooperate with the EU using EU law enforcement and criminal justice mechanisms. The Home Office has therefore coordinated the preparation of robust contingency plans, to ensure that we can transition our cooperation with European partners and continue to work together through alternative channels, should that be required. Broadly speaking, this would mean making more use of Interpol, Council of Europe Conventions and bilateral channels. Whilst these alternatives are not like-for-like replacements, they are largely tried and tested mechanisms which the UK already uses to cooperate with many non-EU countries.
