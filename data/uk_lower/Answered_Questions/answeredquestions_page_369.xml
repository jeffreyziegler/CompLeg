"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446825","Department of Health","false","2016-01-26","<p>Whether or not National Health Service bodies are able to claim back the costs depends on a number of circumstances. For instance:</p><br /><p>- A clinical commissioning group (CCG) may have placed a contract for elective surgery with an independent sector provider. A patient treated in this provider’s hospital may experience complications and require further treatment, which has to be arranged under the CCG’s separate contract with the local NHS trust or foundation trust (FT) (perhaps because it has the facilities to carry out more specialist treatment); or</p><br /><p>- An NHS trust or FT may sub-contract surgical procedures to an independent sector provider. Again, a patient treated at the sub-contractor’s hospital may experience complications and require further treatment, which has to be carried out by the NHS Trust or FT (again, because it has the facilities to carry out more specialist treatment).</p><br /><p>The terms of such subcontracts are not nationally prescribed, but it would be usual for such a sub-contract to require the sub-contractor to indemnify the NHS provider for the cost it incurs as a result of negligent or inadequate treatment on the part of the sub-contractor.</p><br /><p>However, it is important to be clear that complications after surgery are not necessarily associated with negligence. It is normal for patients experiencing complications to be referred to the hospital which can provide the best care. In these circumstances, each NHS provider will normally be paid by the relevant NHS commissioner for the specific service it has provided to the patient.</p><br /><p>In the first example, the NHS trust or FT will be paid in full by its local CCG for the further treatment it has provided, at the normal national prices laid down in the National Tariff Payment System. Normally, the CCG would also have paid for the initial treatment provided by the independent sector provider, but if there is evidence of breach of contract or negligence, the CCG would be entitled to be indemnified for the additional costs of further treatment.</p><br /><p>In the second example, the NHS provider is responsible to the commissioner both for the treatment it has carried out itself and under sub-contract by the independent sector provider. It will therefore be paid by its CCG at National Tariff prices for all the operations that have been undertaken at both hospitals – though, again, this would be subject to the potential for the CCG to withhold payment to in a clear case of negligence or breach of contractual requirements. Payment between the NHS provider and its sub-contractor would be a matter for those parties to agree locally between themselves, as a part of their sub-contract.</p><br /> <br />","Mid Norfolk","George Freeman",,"2016-01-26T15:33:22.34Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446825/answer","Biography information for George Freeman","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446825/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446825/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2016-01-21","NHS: Private Sector","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, whether NHS bodies which carry out surgery to repair work performed by outsourcing companies are able to claim back the costs of carrying out that work.","false","Biography information for Mr Roger Godsiff","Birmingham, Hall Green","Mr Roger Godsiff","23636"

We understand that the Commission will also be undertaking a detailed assessment of the economic impacts of granting MES as part of their consideration of this issue. We will examine any proposal and assessment carefully. The Prime Minister has previously stated that he will make the case for China to be granted MES but China will need to show that it is committed to becoming more open as it becomes more prosperous. In considering the Commission’s proposal it will be important to consider the wider trade and international political context including compliance with international commitments. If China is granted MES, the Commission will still be able to pursue anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases and impose measures where evidence of dumping or subsidy is found.</p><br /><p>The government is strongly in favour of effective trade defences to tackle unfair trade practices. The Government voted in favour of anti-dumping measures on steel products in July and November and lobbied successfully for an investigation into re-bar.

Government departments are working together to support UK businesses looking to take advantage of overseas opportunities and to create a strong business environment that allows UK businesses to flourish both at home and overseas.</p><br /><p>My noble Friend Lord Maude of Horsham made a <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2016-01-19/HLWS466/" target="_blank">statement</a> to the House on Tuesday 19<sup>th</sup> January on the Government’s strategy to support Trade. This outlines a new, whole-of-government approach to expanding the number of exporters and the value they generate for the British economy. The aim is to make it easier for small business to access this support through better digital platforms, working more closely with partners and making sure services match the needs of business.</p><br /><p>In addition, the cross-Government ‘One Government at the Border’ (OG@B) will focus on simplifying the experience of moving goods in and out of the UK, especially for those businesses which are smaller and new to exporting.</p><br /><p>The UK is currently ranked by the World Economic Forum and the World Bank within the top 10 countries in the world for ease of doing business. The British Business Bank offers £2.4bn of finance to over 40,000 smaller businesses. Included within this is the Start-Up Loans programme, which has provided over 35,000 loans worth over £192 million. We have saved businesses £10 billion of red tape and we have extended small business rate relief.</p><br /><p>The Government will continue to back small firms to grow at home and overseas and to create jobs by providing an environment in which they can thrive. This means cutting a further £10 billion of red tape, extending business rates relief, tackling late payment culture and improving access to finance. Through these and other support mechanisms the Government is committed to helping an additional 100,000 companies export successfully by 2020 compared to 2010.</p>","Broxtowe","Anna Soubry",,"2016-01-28T17:22:09.633Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446222/answer","Biography information for Anna Soubry","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446222/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/446222/answer",,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2016-01-20","Small Businesses: Exports","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, what steps his Department is taking to reduce export costs for businesses to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to increase their levels of exports.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","23498"

Children with disabilities should have the same opportunities as other children to access high-quality childcare.</p><p>Local authorities are required by legislation to secure early education places offering 570 hours a year over no fewer than 38 weeks of the year for all three- and four-year olds, including those with disabilities. The Childcare Bill is delivering extended entitlement to free childcare for working parents of three- and four-year-olds. This will provide eligible parents with a total of 30 hours of free childcare per week, over 38 weeks or the equivalent number of hours across more weeks per year.</p><p>Early Implementers of the extended childcare entitlement will focus on key delivery issues, including access for children with SEND, in order to provide critical learning to inform national rollout.</p><p>All early years providers are required to have arrangements in place to identify and support children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), and to promote equality of opportunity for children in their care. These requirements are set out in the Early Years Foundation Stage Framework 2014. The SEND Code of Practice, introduced as part of the wide-ranging reforms set out in the Children and Families Act, gives guidance on how children between the ages of 0 and 25 with SEN or disabilities are to be supported and providers are statutorily required to have regard for this Code of Practice.</p><p>The Government has invested £5.3 million to voluntary and community sector organisations this year. A number of these programmes are delivering specific SEND training to the early years workforce. In particular, the National Day Nurseries Association’s current SEND Champions grant has proven very popular amongst the workforce.</p><p>The Department funds local authorities’ high needs provision in both the early years and schools through the Dedicated Schools Grant; local authorities have reported that they are planning to spend over £90 million from their high needs budgets on children in their early years. The Spending Review provided a generous uplift in the funding early years providers will receive from April 2017 and protection for the majority of high needs funding. We recognise the critical importance of childcare to parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities; we will consider SEN funding for early years as part of wider consultations in 2016 on how we introduce a fairer funding system.</p><p>This Government is committed to helping parents with disabled children. For example, from early 2017 working parents with children under the age of 17 who have a disability will be able to access support under Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) worth up to £4,000 per child, per year.

In such a case it would be appropriate to reconsider the decision if further significant evidence were to become available at a later date especially if the alleged offence is a serious one.</em></p><p><em>Special circumstances which might justify departure from this policy include: </em></p><p><em>(1) rare cases where reconsiderations of the original decision show that it was not justified and the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system requires that a prosecution be brought notwithstanding the earlier decision; and </em></p><p><em>(2) those cases where termination has been effected specifically with a view to the collection and preparation of the necessary evidence which is thought likely to become available in the fairly near future.
