It also requires that where Member States have allowed re-homing, they will also ensure that a re-homing scheme is in place that ensures the socialisation of the animal. <br><br>The Directive permits Member States to go beyond the requirements of the Directive, on the basis of animal welfare, only where the provisions were already in place in November 2010. The Directive does not provide legal grounds on which the UK can impose such a mandatory obligation of re-homing as part of licensing. <br><br>The UK legislation allows re-homing. The requirements are provided for in licence conditions and by virtue of section 17A of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. <br><br>On our acceptance of certain reassurances, relating to section 17A of the 1986 Act, authority may be given to re-home animals being held at an establishment. This applies to those animals that were bred or held for supply for use in regulated procedures, were intended for use in regulated procedures, or have been used in regulated procedures and are being kept alive under the care of the Named Veterinary Surgeon. This authority would relate to individually identified animals and records would be held at the establishment to confirm that such animals had been re-homed.<br><br>Consideration is normally given to the release of animals from the controls of the Act if there is no scientific requirement for them to be humanely killed at the end of the procedures. Some animals are not released if veterinary advice indicates that they may not remain in good health, or that their temperament would not be suited to such an environment.<br><br>Comprehensive guidance on setting free and re-homing is given in section 5.21 in the Guidance on the Operation of the 1986 Act. The Home Office intends to provide further advice about the re-homing of laboratory animals from licensed establishments where there are provisions in the legislation. Animals which have been born into, and lived all their lives under, laboratory conditions may not be able to adapt to a different lifestyle and may be very distressed by such change. There must be provision for careful individual assessment as well as a structured socialisation programme to ensure that re-homing is in the best interests of the individual animal.</p><p> </p>","Lewes","Norman Baker",,"2014-06-16T16:23:09.73854Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61754/answer","Biography information for Norman Baker","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61754/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/61754/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2014-06-12","Animal Experiments","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment she has made of the potential benefit of introducing a compulsory retirement programme for animals used in laboratories and scientific experiments; and if she will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Tracey Crouch","Chatham and Aylesford","Tracey Crouch","200559"

The survey does not identify separately those aged five years and over.</p><p>It is encouraging to note that after 12 years of consistently rising prices, the costs of childcare in England have stabilised for the first time. In fact, once inflation is taken into account costs for the majority of parents have actually fallen. This means more parents are able to access affordable childcare and support their families.</p><p>But the Government is not complacent, and we are working to further increase childcare supply, which will further improve choice and affordability for parents:</p><p>a) More schools are opening their own nurseries for the first time, and we are establishing child-minder agencies to increase the number of child-minders available.<br>b) An increasing number of existing school nurseries are extending opening times from 8am to 6pm.<br>c) We are also making it easier for good nurseries to grow, by removing red-tape and planning restrictions.</p><p>The Government recently announced that the new Tax-Free Childcare scheme will be increased up to £2000 per child and extended to all children under 12 from September next year. This will help around 2 million families.</p><p>To help disadvantaged families, the Government has extended the 15 hours a week of funded early education already available for all three- and four-year-olds to include the most disadvantaged 20% of two-year-olds, and this will be extended further to 40% from September 2014.</p><p>The Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP) will provide nurseries, schools and other providers of government funded early education with extra money for disadvantaged three- and four-year-olds. The EYPP will be £50 million in 2015-16 and the Department for Education will consult on the details of the programme shortly.<br><br>And all families in Universal Credit will be able to receive 85% support on childcare costs, up from 70% under the current working tax credit system. This change will see 300,000 working families getting more out of the money they earn.
