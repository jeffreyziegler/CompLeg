There are a number of laws and measures which police and local authorities can take to tackle dog attacks on livestock.</p><p> </p><p>The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 includes provisions to prosecute owners whose dogs kill, attack or chase livestock, and to seize the dogs if they are out of control. This can lead to a prison sentence of up to six months, an unlimited fine or a disqualification order which prevents the owner from keeping dogs for a certain period of time. The police can also take action under the Dogs Act 1871. This is a useful measure to help police and local authorities to deal with dogs that are out of control and dangerous, which includes being dangerous to other animals. Section 2 of the 1871 Act allows a complaint to be made by any individual, or the police, local authorities, etc., to a Magistrates’ court that a dog is “…dangerous and not kept under proper control”.</p><p> </p><p>As well as these Acts there are anti-social behaviour measures, in particular the Community Protection Notice (CPN) which can be issued as a preventative measure. This means that the owner or keeper of an out of control dog could be prevented from walking it on a farmer's land. This will restrict access to when livestock is not out and ensure that the dog is kept on a lead when in fields with livestock. To breach a CPN is a criminal offence and attracts a maximum penalty of £2,500, or the option to issue a Fixed Penalty Notice. It is worth noting that there are also seizure powers under the legislation.</p><p> </p><p>Since April 2016, we have required all dogs to be identified by a microchip. This is quick and easy to do and provides a failsafe method of connecting dogs with their owners and has encouraged more responsible dog ownership.</p><p> </p><p>Defra continues to work with the National Police Chiefs’ Council Livestock Working Group which is looking at ways to reduce livestock attacks. The NFU is represented at this group and we are encouraging others in the farming and countryside community. This includes supporting the work of SheepWatch, which has produced leaflets to encourage the reporting and recording of incidents and to follow the guidance that is available on what to do when there is a dog attack.</p><p> </p>","Macclesfield","David Rutley",,"2019-04-25T14:54:23.827Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1121821/answer","Biography information for David Rutley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1121821/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1121821/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-04-18","Sheep Worrying","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what additional steps his Department will take to reduce the number of incidents of sheep worrying.","false","Biography information for Dr Matthew Offord","Hendon","Dr Matthew Offord","245756"

The government has a growing programme of ambitious policies to drive forward progress towards this aspiration, including extending the Energy Company Obligation from 2022 to 2028 to support more than £3bn of investment to upgrade the energy efficiency of around a million more homes, tightening the regulations on minimum energy efficiency standards in private rented homes, and announcing the introduction of a Future Homes Standard to ensure that all new homes are built with world-leading levels of energy efficiency and low-carbon heating. The government is further considering the detail of these policies, in order to unlock the necessary energy efficiency improvements for homes and businesses during the 2020s.</p><p> </p><p>At Spring Statement, the Chancellor confirmed that the National Infrastructure Strategy will be published later in 2019, alongside the Spending Review and Autumn Budget.

The government has a growing programme of ambitious policies to drive forward progress towards this aspiration, including extending the Energy Company Obligation from 2022 to 2028 to support more than £3bn of investment to upgrade the energy efficiency of around a million more homes, tightening the regulations on minimum energy efficiency standards in private rented homes, and announcing the introduction of a Future Homes Standard to ensure that all new homes are built with world-leading levels of energy efficiency and low-carbon heating. The government is further considering the detail of these policies, in order to unlock the necessary energy efficiency improvements for homes and businesses during the 2020s.</p><p> </p><p>At Spring Statement, the Chancellor confirmed that the National Infrastructure Strategy will be published later in 2019, alongside the Spending Review and Autumn Budget.

BEIS estimate that the total investment cost of meeting this aspiration is in the order of £35-65 billion (undiscounted), with the actual cost dependent on a range of factors including the technology mix used in particular properties.</p><p> </p><p>Further innovation in home energy efficiency measures could lead to cost reductions which reduce these estimates significantly. A key component of the Buildings Mission announced last year, is to halve the cost of retrofitting existing homes to a similar standard of new homes. We recently approved a £10 million innovation project for whole house retrofit, to demonstrate a cost reduction trajectory through retrofitting similar properties at scale.</p><p> </p><p>Improving the energy efficiency of our homes reduces the overall energy system costs of heat decarbonisation. The level of additional energy efficiency required is dependent on the heat decarbonisation scenario.</p><p> </p><p>Given the scale of investment required, financing these improvements will require funding from both public and private sources. In the Clean Growth Strategy, we committed to extend support for home energy efficiency improvements to 2028 at least at current levels of support through the Energy Company Obligation. This is equivalent to around £6 billion of investment. Additional investment in cost-effective energy efficiency measures will be needed from private sources, including owner occupiers, social landlords and private landlords. For example, landlords of the worst performing properties are already required to invest up to £3500 in improving their homes to a minimum EPC Band E before they let their property, where no third party funding is available.</p><p> </p><p>Different parts of the UK have taken different approaches, reflecting the devolved nature of energy efficiency policy. In Scotland, for instance, zero interest loans are available to homeowners for energy efficiency improvements as well as equity loans where interest is repaid on sale of the property.</p><p> </p><p>In other EU countries a range of approaches have been taken to support home energy efficiency improvements. These include low and zero interest loans, mortgage incentives, capital subsidies, tax credits and reduced VAT on the installation of energy efficiency measures. We are always looking to learn from international experience in developing policies which are right for the UK.</p><p> </p><p>Given the importance of low cost financing, our Call for Evidence on Building a Market for Energy Efficiency sought evidence on different ways of financing energy efficiency, and other fiscal incentives. Different approaches will be appropriate for different consumer groups and tenure types and there is no one size fits all approach. We are currently analysing responses to this.</p><p> </p><p>Financing these improvements presents real opportunities for green finance innovation, for example around green mortgage products or green bonds. The UK’s first ever Green Finance Strategy will also be published in the summer. This strategy will build on the recommendations of the Green Finance Taskforce report: Accelerating Green Finance and will set out the steps required to attract the investment we need into our clean economy, including around financing residential energy efficiency.</p><p> </p><p>We will set out further details on how we will catalyse the market for energy efficiency later in the year and stimulate the required investment.

Firstly, we will ensure that the UK remains the best place to start and grow a digital business. We will do this by fostering a supportive business environment, encouraging support to scale-ups, and by means of access to talent. Secondly, we want to ensure that the UK is well positioned to develop and adopt emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive productivity. This will be achieved by means of the AI sector deal, funding for research posts, and by meeting our target of public and private sector investment in R&amp;D to reach 2.4% of GDP by 2027. Thirdly, we will ensure that the benefits and opportunities of technology, including digital connectivity, are felt by all and are spread across the UK. A key priority is to achieve Government plans to have 15 million premises connected to full fibre (so-called 'outside-in') by 2025, and nationwide coverage by 2033. We will continue to deliver the Digital Skills Partnership to improve digital capability across the whole skills spectrum. Importantly, we will continue to emphasise the importance of diversity within the tech sector, as this is an area I feel strongly about.</p><p> </p><p>The Online Harms White Paper sets out the Government’s plans for world leading laws to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online.

The content will also cover understanding emotions; identifying where someone is experiencing signs of poor mental health; simple self-care; and how and when to seek support.

The funding allocated looks to reflect the outcomes of a sample costing exercise carried out with National Health Service trusts in 2009 and was intended to cover the costs to the provider of delivering the placement. The move from local prices to a national price for undergraduate medical placements resulted in a reduction in the overall funding quantum being paid to providers. This funding was reinvested into the NHS via the non-medical tariff that was also introduced in April 2013. The increase in the available funding enabled a payment of £3,175 per full time equivalent placement to be made to placement providers. Despite the increase in funding, the need to remain within the overall funding quantum allocated for placements meant that payments for non-medical remained a contribution to the costs of delivering the non-medical placement and not reflective of the actual costs to the provider.</p><p>The postgraduate medical tariff was introduced in 2014 and involved the redistribution of the existing funding, enabling HEE to make a 50% contribution to the costs of the basic salary, alongside a clinical placement fee of £12,400.</p><p>Subsequent increases and reductions to individual tariff payments have been limited, with any changes based on a need to ensure that the total funding paid to providers through the tariffs remains within the placement budget available to HEE.</p><p>The Department is working with HEE and NHS Improvement to consider the distribution of funding across the tariffs for 2020/21.</p><p> </p>","Wimbledon","Stephen Hammond",,"2019-04-30T16:02:39.353Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122031/answer","Biography information for Stephen Hammond","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122031/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122031/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2019-04-18","NHS: Training","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if he will publish the criteria used by Health Education England to determine the clinical placement tariff for (a) nursing, (b) medicine and (c) allied health students.","false","Biography information for Justin Madders","Ellesmere Port and Neston","Justin Madders","245838"

Friend, the Secretary of State for Education announced an increase of £250 million in the level of funding up to 2020, for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). This brings the total level of high needs funding to £6.3 billion in this financial year 2019-20. The level of high needs funding in future years will depend on the next Spending Review. Decisions taken locally determine how much of this funding is spent on children with autism and other types of special educational needs (SEN). Information from local authorities or schools on how much of their funding is spent on children with autism is not held centrally.</p><p> </p><p>We believe that all teachers should be teachers of children with SEN. We have provided £3.4 million funding over 2018-2020, for the SEND schools’ workforce contract, which will be delivered by the Whole School SEND consortium, led by National Association of Special Educational Needs. The SEND schools’ workforce contract’s aim is to embed SEND into school improvement in order to equip the workforce to deliver high quality teaching across all types of SEND, including children and young people with autism.</p><p>We recognise that some schools, including special schools, are facing challenges in recruiting and retaining teachers.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122129","Home Office","false","2019-04-25","<p>The Government is very concerned about increases in knife crime and its impact on victims, families and communities. The action we are taking is set out in our Serious Violence Strategy and includes new legislation in the Offensive Weapons Bill, raising awareness among young people of the dangers of carrying a knife, supporting local early intervention projects and continuing police action under Operation Sceptre. The latest anti-knife crime week of action under Operation Sceptre took place from 11-18 March.</p><p>We are encouraging the police to use stop and search. It is a vital policing tool when used correctly and officers have the Government's full support to use these powers in a targeted way that is fair, lawful and effective. The Home Secretary has announced he is relaxing voluntary best practice guidance around the use of Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which allows officers to stop and search anyone in a designated area in anticipation of serious violence.</p><p>The changes will allow the police to more quickly and effectively use these powers in anticipation of serious violence, safeguarding the public. <br>We have also listened to the police request that we introduce new Knife Crime Prevention Orders to help them to divert those involved in knife crime away from a violent lifestyle. The Government introduced the new Order in the Offensive Weapons Bill, currently awaiting Royal Assent.</p><p>The Offensive Weapons Bill includes specific new knives offences, in par-ticular making it an offence to possess certain offensive weapons in private, and stopping knives being sent to residential addresses after they are bought online unless the seller has arrangements with a delivery company to verify age. These measures are designed to help the police in their re-sponse to knife crime.</p><p>In addition to supporting the police on law enforcement, our Serious Vio-lence Strategy stresses the importance of early intervention to tackle the root causes of serious violence and provide young people with the skills and resilience to lead productive lives free from violence. This is why we are providing £22 million to support early intervention and prevention projects through our Early Intervention Youth Fund which is already supporting 29 projects in England and Wales, including the Box Clever project in Humber-side.</p><p>We are also supporting a national knife crime media campaign - #knifefree - to raise awareness of the consequences of knife crime. Its initial campaign was launched in March 2018 across England and Wales and activity includ-ed video on demand, street posters, social media, digital audio and video and partner engagement. The latest campaign went live on 1 April 2019.</p><p>Last October, the Government also announced a new £200 million Youth Endowment Fund to be delivered over 10 years to support interventions with children and young people at risk of involvement in crime and violence, focusing on those most at risk to steer them away from becoming serious offenders. This is now up and running and the charity Impetus, working in partnership with the Early Intervention Foundation and Social Investment Business, is operating the Fund.</p><p>In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Spring Statement on 13 March that there will be £100 million additional funding for the police in 2019/20 to tackle serious violence, including £80m of new funding from the Treasury. The majority of the investment will largely go towards supporting police forces most affected by the violence we are see-ing, but the funding will also support Violence Reduction Units, bringing to-gether a range of agencies, including health, education, social services and others, to develop a multi-agency approach to preventing serious violence.</p><p>The Prime Minister also hosted the Serious Youth Violence Summit from 1 – 4 April that underlined the whole of Government approach we are taking to tackle this issue. At this summit, the Prime Minister announced she would be chairing a new Ministerial Taskforce, supported by a dedicated Cabinet Office team, to oversee the cross-government programme of ac-tion.</p><p>On 1 April, we also launched our consultation on a new legal duty to ensure public bodies take action to prevent serious violence. The consultation will close on 28 May. It explores how a legal duty will support effective multi-agency work.

Over 600 people have been arrested for carrying weapons under s60 searches since 2010/11. Every weapon off our streets is a success and helps protect those communities who disproportionately experience serious violence.</p><p>On 31 March 2019, the Government announced that we will make it simpler for the police in the seven forces particularly affected by violent crime to use section 60 (area-wide) stop and search powers where they reasonably believe that an incident involving serious violence may occur. The changes are designed to allow the police to use these powers more quickly and effectively in anticipation of serious violence, safeguarding the public. These relaxations will apply for twelve months, with a review at the halfway point, in the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), South Wales, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and Merseyside.</p><p>The Home Office paper ‘Do initiatives involving substantial increases in stop and search reduce crime? Assessing the impact of Operation BLUNT 2’ was published in March 2016. The paper reviewed the impact of a substantial increase in stop and search, including those under s60, from an average base level of stop and search which is higher than current levels.</p><p>Across the MPS there was a near threefold increase in weapons searches from 70,378 in 2007/08 to 205,704 in 2008/09. The study found that large surges in stop and search activity at the borough level had no discernible crime-reducing effects. However, the study concluded that it did not necessarily follow that stop and search activity does not reduce crime, either through more localised impacts, or through the existence of a ‘base level’ of stop and search activity where the tactic does have an effect.</p><p>Since 2010, the total number of stop and searches in England and Wales has decreased by 78% from 1.3 million in 2010/11 to fewer than 300,000 searches in 2017/18. The number of searches has also decreased by 72% compared to the five-year period prior to the commencement of Operation Blunt 2 in 2008. In addition, weapon specific searches in the MPS fell by 81%, from 136,126 in 2010/11 to 26,188 in 2017/18.</p><p>The large decrease in stop and searches, including searches for weapons, changes the operational context significantly and means it is not possible to make meaningful inferences from the 2016 research findings to the current s60 pilot.</p>","Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner","Mr Nick Hurd",,"2019-04-25T12:26:25.533Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122203/answer","Biography information for Mr Nick Hurd","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122203/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1122203/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-04-18","Stop and Search","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to his announcement on 1 April 2019 on the increased use of stop and search to tackle violent crime, what assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of the Home Office research paper, Do initiatives involving substantial increases in stop and search reduce crime?
