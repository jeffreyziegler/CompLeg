Amongst other things, this has included laying the UK’s Goods Schedule at the WTO for certification, which was done on 24 July 2018. The UK’s Schedule replicates the EU28’s bound tariffs and sets out UK specific tariff rate quota (TRQ) volumes determined by a joint EU-UK agreed apportionment methodology. The underlying principle of the approach to establishing TRQs is to maintain current levels of market access into the UK for all WTO members.</p><p> </p><p>Certifying the UK’s Goods Schedule is a process, and we are aware that some WTO members have expressed concern about potential impacts on existing access to trade which result from the apportionment methodology. In response, on 21 December 2018 the UK Government formally opened an Article XXVIII process under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which specifically addresses TRQs. This was done with a view to engaging directly with WTO members about their concerns, and working towards formal certification of the UK’s Goods Schedule. This process is currently underway.</p><p> </p><p>Defra officials have been engaging directly with officials from Australia and New Zealand since 2016. We are fully aware of their views and have established a dialogue, including negotiations through Article XXVIII, to resolve the issues that they raise.</p><p> </p><p>In light of this, we do not expect the UK to be subject to formal complaint procedures in relation to TRQs.

The targets are multi-faceted and global in scope. As such not all targets can be achieved by individual countries alone; they require collective action. Target 10, for example, requires countries to minimize anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs and other vulnerable ecosystems. The UK is making progress with protecting coral reefs and restoring other vulnerable ecosystems such as peatland, but they remain vulnerable to climate change. The real value of the targets is in driving positive change across the world and the report sets out clear areas of progress in the UK on which we are determined to build.</p><p> </p><p>Domestic biodiversity policy is a devolved matter and the information provided relates to England only, except in relation to our plans internationally.</p><p> </p><p>On land, over 93% of our protected sites, covering over 1 million hectares, are now in good condition or have management in place to restore their condition. Over the last 2 years, we have already introduced funding for peatland ecosystem restoration and woodland expansion as a contribution to climate change mitigation. At sea, we are putting management measures in place to protect existing MPAs and expanding our network of sites. We have consulted on a third tranche of 41 Marine Conservation Zones. Sites to be designated will be in place by 7 June. Our agencies and non-Departmental bodies are working on species recovery projects with landowning and conservation partners, for example on freshwater pearl mussel, short-haired bumblebee and stone curlew.</p><p> </p><p>The ongoing declines in nature are a global problem that need a global solution. That is why the UK is committed to playing a leading role in developing a global post-2020 framework under the CBD that is ambitious and transformational. Our Darwin Initiative supports global action by providing grants to protect biodiversity and the natural environment, with £10.6 million awarded in 2018.

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), several factors increase susceptibility to hyperkalaemia including a high dietary potassium intake relative to residual renal function. When patients with CKD have other risk factors, for example treatment with drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the risk of hyperkalaemia is further increased. Clinical presentation of hyperkalaemia is highly variable with some patients presenting with an acute illness whilst others may be asymptomatic.</p><p> </p><p>Although not completely preventable, the risk of developing hyperkalaemia can be reduced. Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults, a collaboration between the Renal Association and Resuscitation Council UK that is endorsed by a range of organisations, including the College of Emergency Medicine and the Faculty of Intensive Care medicine, sets out evidence-based guidance on the management of the condition. It was developed to improve the treatment of acute hyperkalaemia and to reduce the risk of complications associated with hyperkalaemia and its treatment. The main measures in primary prevention in patients with CKD are regular blood monitoring, careful drug prescribing and dietary advice. Patient information and education may reduce the risk of inadvertent hyperkalaemia.
