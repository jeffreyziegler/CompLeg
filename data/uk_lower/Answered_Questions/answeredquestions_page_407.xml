Together with the previous report, it indicates that there were no Government-to-Government sales of military goods to Iraqi military forces in 2013 or 2014. In addition, there is no record of any sales of military goods from the UK Government to Iraqi military forces in the period from January to the end of June 2015. This period will be covered in the next Annual Report published in 2016.</p><p>With regard to military goods exported by UK companies to Iraq, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, is the appropriate UK licensing authority. The Government holds information on export licensing decisions for military goods from the UK to Iraq but it does not hold data on actual sales of defence exports and has no information on whether any such exports to Iraq have been used specifically to combat ISIL or for other defence or security purposes.</p><p>I can inform you that 30 Individual Export Licences have been issued for military goods from the UK to Iraq for the period from January 2014 to the end of March 2015. Data on these 30 export licences is publicly available via the Government's Strategic Export Controls: Reports and Statistics website https:// www. exportcontroldb.bis.gov. uk/sdb/fox/sdb/SDBHOME. Data covering the period 1 April to 30 June 2015 is due to be published in October 2015, while data on the export of military goods from the UK to Iraq prior to January 2014 is also available on the same website.</p><p>In addition the UK Government is providing extensive support to the GOI in the continuing fight against ISIL, with the gifting of equipment forming a significant part of this. Previously, Her Majesty's Government has gifted 50 tonnes of non-lethal support, 40 heavy machine guns and nearly half a million rounds of ammunition to the Kurdish Peshmerga. The latest equipment to be gifted to the Peshmerga consists of additional medical supplies. The supplies consist of items such as tourniquets, bandage kits and dressings for wounds and fill a significant gap in their resources, leading to the preservation of life and proper treatment of injuries sustained in combat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Ludlow","Mr Philip Dunne",,"2015-09-11T13:12:01.413Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391739/answer","Biography information for Mr Philip Dunne","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391739/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391739/answer",,,,,"11","Defence","Defence","2015-07-21","Iraq: Arms Trade","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how many British arms (a) the Government and (b) British companies have sold to Iraqi military forces to combat ISIL.","false","Biography information for Tulip Siddiq","Hampstead and Kilburn","Tulip Siddiq","8245"

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the prime areas of learning that early years providers must follow and this includes a focus on communication and language.

It requires teachers to be able to use and evaluate distinctive approaches to engage and support children and to have the skills and awareness to know when a child is in need of additional support. The Department for Education provides grants to a number of expert organisations so that they can support the early years workforce to meet the needs of children with speech, language and communication difficulties.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391821","Department of Health","false","2015-09-08","<p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has produced a Green-top guideline: Prevention of Early-Onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease. The Green-top guideline provides guidance for obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists on the prevention of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. The first edition was published in 2003 and the second updated edition was published in 2012. An audit in partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and supported by the Royal College of Midwives was recently carried out by the RCOG. It examined current practice in preventing early- onset neonatal GBS disease by investigating the implementation of the RCOG Green-top guideline (2012 edition) and identified key areas for improvement. The first report was published on 5 March 2015 and found that the majority of obstetric units in the United Kingdom have written protocols to prevent early onset GBS disease in newborn babies. However, there is still variation in practice across units. The second report is due to be published later this year. Further information is available at:</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/rcog-release-new-audit-into-gbs-finds-variation-in-practice-across-obstetric-units/" target="_blank">https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/rcog-release-new-audit-into-gbs-finds-variation-in-practice-across-obstetric-units/</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published a clinical guideline which addresses early-onset GBS and other neonatal infections, ‘Antibiotics for early-onset neonatal infection: Antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of early-onset neonatal infection’ (August 2012).The clinical guideline is available at:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg149" target="_blank">http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg149</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Information on GBS in pregnancy is publically available on the NHS Choices website at:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/pregnancy-infections.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/pregnancy-infections.aspx</a>.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391914","Department of Health","false","2015-09-08","<p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>The Government recognises the valuable contribution made by carers, many of whom spend a significant proportion of their life providing support to family members or friends. Professionals in health, education, social care and other parts of the community including employers, have a key role to play in identifying and signposting those with caring responsibilities to information, advice and support.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care 2014 is a historic step for carers, for the first time putting their rights on the same footing as the people they care for. Under the Care Act, local authorities have an expanded duty to assess carers, removing the previous test of whether they were providing “regular and substantial” care. This is predicted to lead to an additional 360,000 carers a year receiving an assessment by 2018/19. In addition, local authorities are required to ensure that there is a comprehensive information and advice service available to their local population, specifically including carers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the Act, carers’ assessments will include a thorough consideration of the impact a caring role has on a carer’s wellbeing and the outcomes they wish to achieve, including their ability to engage in work, training, education or volunteering. On the basis of these assessments, local authorities will have a duty to meet eligible needs for support (and will also be able to meet needs which are not considered eligible). The Department of Health has provided £104 million of funding to local authorities for additional carer assessment and support in 2015/16.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care Act requires National Health Service bodies and local authorities to co-operate with each other in the exercise of their respective functions relevant to care and support, including those relating to carers, so we would expect local authorities and NHS bodies to cooperate in identifying and signposting carers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, we made it clear in our mandate to NHS England that by 2015, carers looking after friends and family members should routinely have access to information and advice about support available, including respite care. This supports Government investment of £400 million between 2011 – 2015 to improve NHS support for carers and to enable them to take a break from their caring responsibilities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Support for carers more broadly is integral to the work NHS England is leading to improve the quality of life of people with long term conditions. NHS England published a <em>Commitment to Carers</em> in May 2014 - an action plan with a series of commitments around eight priorities, including raising the profile of carers; person-centred, well-coordinated care, commissioning support and partnership links. NHS England are currently reviewing progress and developing plans for next steps.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>The Department of Health has also provided over £2 million in recent years to the professional bodies such as the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Nursing, as well as Carers UK and the Carers Trust, to develop initiatives to raise awareness of carers among healthcare professionals and to help identify and support carers. Initiatives have included the recruitment of GP carer champions, work with pharmacy organisations to identify carers in pharmacy settings, and to identify more carers through the 2014 flu vaccination campaign.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>We recognise that many carers of working age wish to stay in touch with the job market for their financial well-being and to enhance their own lives and the lives of those for whom they care. Many also feel under pressure to give up paid work to care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On 30 June 2015 the Government extended a right request flexible working arrangements after a 26 weeks’ qualifying period, building on a previous entitlement for some carers. This will help to normalise the kind of flexible working patterns that can help carers balance different responsibilities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On 13 February the Government launched a joint Department of Health, Government Equality Office and Department for Work and Pensions investment of £1.6 million in pilots in nine local authority areas to explore ways in which people can be supported to combine work and care. Through the scheme, nine pilot areas will explore how professional support, technology, volunteering, informal networks and support from employers can be combined to ease the pressure of caring. This will build on the requirement in the Care Act to consider support for employment as part of an assessment of eligible needs, set out above.</p><p> </p><p>More broadly, the Department for Work and Pensions continues to invest in supporting carers to return to work. For example, income replacement benefits help people and households on lower incomes, and include a carer premium, currently £34.60 a week. An equivalent additional amount applies in Pension Credit. Universal Credit will also include a carer element at the rate of £150.39 per monthly assessment period. This means that lower-income carers can be better off than others who receive these benefits.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On 1 July my Rt. hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Mr Jeremy Hunt) announced that I will develop a new carers’ strategy that looks at the best of international practice and examines what more we can do to support existing carers and the new carers we will need.</p><p> </p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt","8158 ; 8159 ; 8160","2015-09-08T14:54:07.173Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391914/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391914/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391914/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-07-21","Carers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what plans his Department has to support carers who are also in full or part-time employment.","false","Biography information for Greg Mulholland","Leeds North West","Greg Mulholland","8191"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391924","Department of Health","false","2015-09-08","<p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>The Government recognises the valuable contribution made by carers, many of whom spend a significant proportion of their life providing support to family members or friends. Professionals in health, education, social care and other parts of the community including employers, have a key role to play in identifying and signposting those with caring responsibilities to information, advice and support.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care 2014 is a historic step for carers, for the first time putting their rights on the same footing as the people they care for. Under the Care Act, local authorities have an expanded duty to assess carers, removing the previous test of whether they were providing “regular and substantial” care. This is predicted to lead to an additional 360,000 carers a year receiving an assessment by 2018/19. In addition, local authorities are required to ensure that there is a comprehensive information and advice service available to their local population, specifically including carers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the Act, carers’ assessments will include a thorough consideration of the impact a caring role has on a carer’s wellbeing and the outcomes they wish to achieve, including their ability to engage in work, training, education or volunteering. On the basis of these assessments, local authorities will have a duty to meet eligible needs for support (and will also be able to meet needs which are not considered eligible). The Department of Health has provided £104 million of funding to local authorities for additional carer assessment and support in 2015/16.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Care Act requires National Health Service bodies and local authorities to co-operate with each other in the exercise of their respective functions relevant to care and support, including those relating to carers, so we would expect local authorities and NHS bodies to cooperate in identifying and signposting carers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, we made it clear in our mandate to NHS England that by 2015, carers looking after friends and family members should routinely have access to information and advice about support available, including respite care. This supports Government investment of £400 million between 2011 – 2015 to improve NHS support for carers and to enable them to take a break from their caring responsibilities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Support for carers more broadly is integral to the work NHS England is leading to improve the quality of life of people with long term conditions. NHS England published a <em>Commitment to Carers</em> in May 2014 - an action plan with a series of commitments around eight priorities, including raising the profile of carers; person-centred, well-coordinated care, commissioning support and partnership links. NHS England are currently reviewing progress and developing plans for next steps.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>The Department of Health has also provided over £2 million in recent years to the professional bodies such as the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Nursing, as well as Carers UK and the Carers Trust, to develop initiatives to raise awareness of carers among healthcare professionals and to help identify and support carers. Initiatives have included the recruitment of GP carer champions, work with pharmacy organisations to identify carers in pharmacy settings, and to identify more carers through the 2014 flu vaccination campaign.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>We recognise that many carers of working age wish to stay in touch with the job market for their financial well-being and to enhance their own lives and the lives of those for whom they care. Many also feel under pressure to give up paid work to care.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On 30 June 2015 the Government extended a right request flexible working arrangements after a 26 weeks’ qualifying period, building on a previous entitlement for some carers. This will help to normalise the kind of flexible working patterns that can help carers balance different responsibilities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On 13 February the Government launched a joint Department of Health, Government Equality Office and Department for Work and Pensions investment of £1.6 million in pilots in nine local authority areas to explore ways in which people can be supported to combine work and care. Through the scheme, nine pilot areas will explore how professional support, technology, volunteering, informal networks and support from employers can be combined to ease the pressure of caring. This will build on the requirement in the Care Act to consider support for employment as part of an assessment of eligible needs, set out above.</p><p> </p><p>More broadly, the Department for Work and Pensions continues to invest in supporting carers to return to work. For example, income replacement benefits help people and households on lower incomes, and include a carer premium, currently £34.60 a week. An equivalent additional amount applies in Pension Credit. Universal Credit will also include a carer element at the rate of £150.39 per monthly assessment period. This means that lower-income carers can be better off than others who receive these benefits.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On 1 July my Rt. hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Mr Jeremy Hunt) announced that I will develop a new carers’ strategy that looks at the best of international practice and examines what more we can do to support existing carers and the new carers we will need.</p><p> </p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt","8159 ; 8160 ; 8191","2015-09-08T14:54:06.923Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391924/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391924/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/391924/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-07-21","Carers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what plans his Department has to increase support for (a) people caring for people living with and beyond cancer and (b) other carers.","false","Biography information for Greg Mulholland","Leeds North West","Greg Mulholland","8158"

There are 13 closed court buildings closed since May 2010 that are currently not in use, the majority of which were closed under the Court Estate Reform Programme. Five of the closed court buildings which have not been disposed of are either under offer or on the market. Of those which have not yet been brought to the market, four court buildings have shared locations with the police which means the future of the building is tied in with the Police Station, one has a flying freehold issue and the other three were closed recently. We are working on bringing all of them to the market as soon as possible.</p><p>There are temporary costs associated with making sure unused buildings are kept secure, protecting the fabric of the building and property rates payable to local councils. In addition, decommissioning the buildings to make them ready for sale results in some costs which cannot be disaggregated from the overall running costs.

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the prime areas of learning that early years providers must follow and this includes a focus on communication and language.

The Department for Education provides grants to a number of expert organisations so that they can support the early years workforce to meet the needs of children with speech, language and communication difficulties.
