To help achieve this aim, the Government has fundamentally reformed regulation of the consumer credit market, transferring regulatory responsibility from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on 1 April 2014. The FCA has transposed key elements of the OFT’s Irresponsible Lending Guidance into binding rules. The FCA makes clear that a firm should lend responsibly, and takes reasonable steps to assess the customer’s ability to meet repayments in a sustainable manner without undue difficulties, and without having to borrow further. Ultimately, money should only be lent to a consumer if they can afford to repay it.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, the Government has already introduced several initiatives to support the credit union sector.

Our exit from the EU provides an opportunity to consider how best future agriculture and environmental policy can contribute to flood risk management. The Government recently announced £15m specifically for natural flood management schemes across England. This builds on demonstration projects at Pickering in North Yorkshire, Holnicote in Somerset and Upper Derwent, Derbyshire.</p><p> </p><p>They demonstrated that natural measures can be effective in helping to manage flood risk at a catchment scale, slowing the flow of water and reducing local impacts when carefully incorporated into a wider suite of catchment measures, but were unlikely to offer an alternative to conventional defences in areas of greatest risk.</p><p> </p><p>However, we refute the assertion that twice as much is spent on dealing with the after-effects of a flood than is spent on hard flood defences. In 2014/15, the year the report is referring to with respect to hard defences, of the £802.6m spent on flood risk management, £145m was for flood response and repair costs and £657.6m for routine flood risk management measures.</p><p> </p><p>Moreover, in our current 6-year capital programme, we are investing £2.5 billion over six years on flood defences (up until 2021). This is a real terms increase in capital investment. We are exceeding our manifesto commitment by building 1,500 new flood defence schemes that will better protect 300,000 more homes.</p><p> </p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey",,"2016-12-05T11:38:29.1Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647704/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647704/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647704/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2016-11-29","Flood Control","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment her Department has made of the implications for her policies on flooding and land use of the Green Alliance Policy Insight of November 2016, entitled Smarter flood risk management in England.","false","Biography information for Paul Flynn","Newport West","Paul Flynn","55376"

Automatic enrolment was introduced to enable most people in work to save for later life. It has been a great success to date with over 6.8 million eligible workers enrolled by more than 290,000 employers since it began in 2012 and it is important we recognise the contribution employers have made to this achievement.</p><p> </p><p>Automatic enrolment is currently being extended to small and micro employers. While the self-employed are not eligible for automatic enrolment, they will have legal duties to enrol any eligible workers in their employ. The Government understands that these employers may find complying with automatic enrolment challenging and we are doing all we can to make automatic enrolment as straightforward as possible for this group. The Department and The Pensions Regulator (TPR) are focussed on making compliance with automatic enrolment duties as clear as possible, as well as simplifying the language regarding automatic enrolment.</p><p> </p><p>As part of this work, TPR has launched an interactive “Step by Step” guide on their website. This simplified guide to meeting AE duties is designed to meet the specific needs of employers who may not have pensions experience, including those with just one or two staff. The guide includes a duties checker so that employers can easily find out what they will need to do to comply and when. Using the duties checker also means employers will receive tailored communications relevant to their circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>What an employer pays and the amount of time they spend on setting up automatic enrolment will depend on various factors, including how they use business advisers, how they run their payroll and which pension scheme they choose.</p><p> </p><p>From research it has conducted, TPR estimates that small employers with between one and four staff members usually spend a total of about 10 hours overall carrying out all their automatic enrolment tasks, over a 12 month period before their staging date. This research has also shown that average costs associated with outsourced payroll are less than £200 while average pension scheme set up costs are under £500.</p><p> </p><p>Automatic enrolment is a legal duty for employers, just like paying the National Living Wage, tax and National Insurance. There are no plans to reimburse employers for time or costs should their employees choose to opt-out. However, less than one in ten people are choosing to opt-out which is much lower than originally estimated. We have also seen around 5% of people not eligible for automatic enrolment choosing to opt-in to their employer’s pension scheme.</p>",,"Lord Freud",,"2016-12-08T13:40:38.037Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647974/answer","Biography information for Lord Freud","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647974/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/647974/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2016-11-29","Occupational Pensions","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much time they expect it will take self-employed and small businesses to complete the administration associated with the new statutory pension scheme; and whether they will recompense small businesses for their time if all their employees opt-out.","false","Biography information for Lord Moonie",,"Lord Moonie","HL3670"
