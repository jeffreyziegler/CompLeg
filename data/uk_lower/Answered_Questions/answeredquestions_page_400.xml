It is estimated that over 160,000 women a year do not need repeat tests due to mild or borderline results and around 400,000 women have been removed from ten year annual follow-up due to a previous abnormal result.</p><br /><p>In April 2012, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC), which advises Ministers and the National Health Service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy and supports implementation, gave its support for a pilot to assess the value of using HPV testing as primary screening for cervical disease, rather than the currently used cytology test. The pilot has been establishing the feasibility of using HPV as the primary screen for cervical disease in order to achieve better outcomes for women, while minimising over-treatment and anxiety, and whether it is practical to roll out nationally. The UK NSC opened a public consultation on this in July 2015. The consultation closes on 2 November 2015. Ministers expect to receive a recommendation from the UK NSC following the closure of the public consultation.</p><br /><p>Earlier diagnosis and prevention is a key focus of the Independent Cancer Taskforce report, <em>Achieving World-Class Cancer Outcomes: A Strategy for England 2015-2020</em>. It includes a recommendation that, assuming a positive recommendation by the NSC, Public Health England and NHS England should drive a rapid roll-out of primary HPV testing into the cervical screening programme. The Taskforce also made a number of recommendations on the early diagnosis of cancers more generally.</p><br /><p>In addition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published a range of guidance on the treatment and screening of cervical cancer and further information is available at:</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/cancer/cervical-cancer" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/cancer/cervical-cancer</a></p><br /><p><strong></strong></p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2015-10-19T14:56:21.643Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420053/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420053/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420053/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-10-09","Cervical Cancer","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what assessment he has made of progress in diagnosing and treating cervical cancers more effectively in the last five years; and if he will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Nigel Adams","Selby and Ainsty","Nigel Adams","11267"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420100","Department of Health","false","2015-10-19","<p>We do not have data on consultants who opt out of non-emergency weekend working. Individual NHS trusts hold information on consultant working patterns.</p><br /><p>However, this information would not reveal how many individuals have relied on the opt out clause, which allows them to refuse to participate in some weekend work as part of their contract. This is because some rely on the clause to negotiate significantly higher rates of pay for additional work, rather than doing it for the rates payable under the national contract terms on which they are employed.</p><br /><p>In its 2013 report “Managing NHS hospital consultants” the National Audit Office (NAO) stated that “most trusts continue to use locally agreed rates of pay for additional work outside that agreed in job plans, as allowed for under the contract, for example to help reduce waiting times. This is likely to be linked to the fact that the contract allows consultants to refuse to work outside 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday.”</p><br /><p>The NAO reported that 91% of trusts who responded to its survey paid for additional work using locally agreed rates; and, on average, 71% of extra work was secured using these rates, costing up to £200 per hour. Based on the top and the bottom of the consultant pay scale at the time, contractual rates ranged between £36 and £64 per hour. Full details of the NAO’s report and survey findings can be found at:</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/report/managing-nhs-hospital-consultants/" target="_blank">http://www.nao.org.uk/report/managing-nhs-hospital-consultants/</a></p><br /><p>Other practical effects of consultants’ ability to opt-out of non-emergency work at weekends and in the evenings are:</p><br /><p>- an effective veto over work at these times and over service changes;</p><p>- a practical and financial barrier to scheduling consultants and developing and delivering cost-effective and high-quality services in evenings and weekends;</p><p>- impacts on quality/patient care and on mortality rates – contributes to absence of senior decision-makers at the weekends; and</p><p>- impacts on the quality of education and training of junior doctors, who provide the majority of care at these times, and have less exposure (including during the week, as a consequence of working patterns) to working with consultants.</p><br /><p>A report published in July 2015 by the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration, which provides independent advice to the government, observed that the clause is “not an appropriate provision in an NHS which seeks to continue to improve patient care with genuinely seven day services, and on that basis we endorse the case for its removal from the contract”. The review body made this observation after considering evidence from a number of organisations, including from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the British Medical Association (BMA). A link to the report is here:</p><br /><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/review-body-on-doctors-and-dentists-remuneration" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/review-body-on-doctors-and-dentists-remuneration</a></p><br /><p>Together with NHS staff we must eradicate the ‘weekend effect’ of excess deaths in NHS hospitals and support hospitals to better plan services around the clock. The consultant contract needs to be modernised to support employers and doctors to improve patient care across the week.</p><br /><p>We are encouraged that the BMA Consultants’ Committee is working with NHS Employers to reform the contract, and have accepted the replacement of the opt out with safeguards as a starting point for final negotiations. We hope that consultants will vote to accept a modernised contract in the New Year.</p><br />","Ipswich","Ben Gummer",,"2015-10-19T16:39:41.1Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420100/answer","Biography information for Ben Gummer","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420100/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420100/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-10-09","Hospitals: Consultants","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what estimate his Department has made of the proportion of hospital consultants who opt out of weekend work.","false","Biography information for Tulip Siddiq","Hampstead and Kilburn","Tulip Siddiq","10803"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420121","Department of Health","false","2015-10-19","<p>Under the Care Act 2014, local authorities have a responsibility to support carers in a number of ways. Local authorities will be required to undertake carers’ assessments, based on the appearance of a need for support. An assessment must establish the impact of caring on the carer, and the outcomes they wish to achieve, including engaging in work, education, training or recreation. For the first time, local authorities have a duty to meet carers’ eligible needs for support: this may include access to training to support them in their caring role or support to maintain employment where this is a desired outcome.</p><br /><p>Through the Care Act 2014 local authorities are required to provide information and advice and universal preventative services for carers. Local authorities can also support the person in understanding other types of support available to them for example to seek to promote access to appropriate employment, education or training, which can be an effective way of maintaining independence.</p><br /><p>In May 2014, NHS England published an action plan <em>NHS England’s Commitment to Carers,</em> which includes a series of commitments around 8 priorities, among which are raising the profile of carers. The Department of Health has also made available additional funding of £400 million to the National Health Service between 2011 and 2015 to enable carers to take a break from their caring responsibilities to sustain them in their caring role. The carers’ breaks funding of £130 million for 2015 – 16 will also be in the Better Care Fund.</p><br /><p>In February 2015 the Government launched a joint Department of Health, Government Equality Office and Department for Work and Pensions investment of £1.6 million in pilots in nine local authority areas to explore ways in which people can be supported to combine work and care.</p><br /><p>We also fund the Carers Direct service which includes web-based information and advice for all carers through NHS Choices, as well as a telephone helpline service through which carers can be signposted to information. Carers Direct includes training materials that build on the Caring with Confidence programme – a time-limited national programme funded by the Department of Health to support the development of carer training, which closed in September 2010.</p><br /><p>On July 2015 my Rt. hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Mr Jeremy Hunt) announced that the Government will develop a new carers’ strategy that looks at the best of international practice and examines what more we can do to support existing carers and new carers. This will include consideration how best to support carers to maintain employment and of the training requirements of carers and whether current measures are fully meeting these.</p><br /><p>Specifically regarding carers of people with dementia, the Department of Health contributed to the funding of the Alzheimer’s Society’s ‘Dementia Guide’, designed to help guide people with dementia and their carers through their journey with dementia. The Guide provides useful information for carers, following a diagnosis of dementia, and includes advice to help people understand a diagnosis of dementia to enable them to live well with the condition.</p><br /><p>With Department of Health funding, the Royal College of General Practitioners has developed a Dementia Roadmap that can be accessed by families and carers. It is a web based platform that provides high quality information about the dementia journey alongside local information about services, support groups and care pathways, primarily to assist primary care staff to more effectively support people with dementia, their families and carers.</p><br /><p>The Department is supporting the Dementia Action Alliance’s Carers Call to Action and the establishment of a Life Story Network for family carers of people with dementia. The Department provided funding of £30,000 to the Life Story Network during 2014/15 to support the establishment of a new involvement network for family carers of people with dementia, which is being established as part of the legacy of the Dementia Action Alliance’s Carers Call to Action.</p><br /><p>NHS England’s 2015/16 Dementia Enhanced Service encourages GP practices to increase the health and wellbeing support offered to carers of patients diagnosed with dementia.</p><br /> <br />","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt","11240","2015-10-19T14:30:16.367Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420121/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420121/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420121/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-10-09","Dementia: Carers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what training is available to (a) full-time carers and (b) full time carers caring for an adult with dementia.","false","Biography information for Mr Roger Godsiff","Birmingham, Hall Green","Mr Roger Godsiff","11242"

For this reason, the Government is not considering the option in any further detail and does not have cost estimates on a basis which would enable comparison with the preferred Euston terminus option. Euston is the best location for city centre connectivity and has the best onward transport connections to disperse passengers across London and it already has great London Underground connections on the Victoria and Northern lines and the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines from Euston Square. The only way for onward travel from an Old Oak Common terminus would be Crossrail – any service interruption to Crossrail would potentially result in having to close HS2 as passengers would have no adequate alternative onward connection option. A Euston terminus is also essential for releasing capacity on the West Coast Mainline which is effectively full in terms of train paths.</p><br /><p>In addition to not meeting our programme objectives, a terminus at Old Oak Common would still incur a number of significant costs. These include:</p><br /><ul><li>Construction of a much larger HS2 station at the same depth as the Proposed Scheme (approximately 15m below ground level). A terminus station would need not only additional platforms but also additional servicing circulation and interchange facilities.</li><li>Relocation of the Crossrail depot to the north of the station. No alternative location has been identified.</li><li>It might be necessary to acquire properties in Hythe Road and divert the Grand Union Canal in order to provide sufficient space for the platforms and circulation around the station.</li><li>A subterranean drive under tunnel to the west of the North London Line</li></ul><br /><p>Finally, it is worth noting that a very substantial part of the cost of the HS2 scheme at Euston is for Underground and other interchange facilities. These works will be necessary at some stage to serve the growing passenger demand at Euston that would occur irrespective of HS2.</p><br />","Scarborough and Whitby","Mr Robert Goodwill",,"2015-10-19T14:33:58.153Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420325/answer","Biography information for Mr Robert Goodwill","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420325/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420325/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2015-10-09","High Speed 2 Railway Line","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, with reference to paragraph 31 of the report by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee entitled The economics of HS2, published on 25 March 2015, what steps the Government has taken to estimate the overall reduction of cost to High Speed 2 of terminating the line at Old Oak Common, including any necessary redesign of the station at Old Oak Common to make this possible and calculate the effect on the project's cost benefit analysis.","false","Biography information for Keir Starmer","Holborn and St Pancras","Keir Starmer","11228"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420365","Department of Health","false","2015-10-19","<p>Under the Care Act 2014, local authorities have a responsibility to support carers in a number of ways. Local authorities will be required to undertake carers’ assessments, based on the appearance of a need for support. An assessment must establish the impact of caring on the carer, and the outcomes they wish to achieve, including engaging in work, education, training or recreation. For the first time, local authorities have a duty to meet carers’ eligible needs for support: this may include access to training to support them in their caring role or support to maintain employment where this is a desired outcome.</p><br /><p>Through the Care Act 2014 local authorities are required to provide information and advice and universal preventative services for carers. Local authorities can also support the person in understanding other types of support available to them for example to seek to promote access to appropriate employment, education or training, which can be an effective way of maintaining independence.</p><br /><p>In May 2014, NHS England published an action plan <em>NHS England’s Commitment to Carers,</em> which includes a series of commitments around 8 priorities, among which are raising the profile of carers. The Department of Health has also made available additional funding of £400 million to the National Health Service between 2011 and 2015 to enable carers to take a break from their caring responsibilities to sustain them in their caring role. The carers’ breaks funding of £130 million for 2015 – 16 will also be in the Better Care Fund.</p><br /><p>In February 2015 the Government launched a joint Department of Health, Government Equality Office and Department for Work and Pensions investment of £1.6 million in pilots in nine local authority areas to explore ways in which people can be supported to combine work and care.</p><br /><p>We also fund the Carers Direct service which includes web-based information and advice for all carers through NHS Choices, as well as a telephone helpline service through which carers can be signposted to information. Carers Direct includes training materials that build on the Caring with Confidence programme – a time-limited national programme funded by the Department of Health to support the development of carer training, which closed in September 2010.</p><br /><p>On July 2015 my Rt. hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Mr Jeremy Hunt) announced that the Government will develop a new carers’ strategy that looks at the best of international practice and examines what more we can do to support existing carers and new carers. This will include consideration how best to support carers to maintain employment and of the training requirements of carers and whether current measures are fully meeting these.</p><br /><p>Specifically regarding carers of people with dementia, the Department of Health contributed to the funding of the Alzheimer’s Society’s ‘Dementia Guide’, designed to help guide people with dementia and their carers through their journey with dementia. The Guide provides useful information for carers, following a diagnosis of dementia, and includes advice to help people understand a diagnosis of dementia to enable them to live well with the condition.</p><br /><p>With Department of Health funding, the Royal College of General Practitioners has developed a Dementia Roadmap that can be accessed by families and carers. It is a web based platform that provides high quality information about the dementia journey alongside local information about services, support groups and care pathways, primarily to assist primary care staff to more effectively support people with dementia, their families and carers.</p><br /><p>The Department is supporting the Dementia Action Alliance’s Carers Call to Action and the establishment of a Life Story Network for family carers of people with dementia. The Department provided funding of £30,000 to the Life Story Network during 2014/15 to support the establishment of a new involvement network for family carers of people with dementia, which is being established as part of the legacy of the Dementia Action Alliance’s Carers Call to Action.</p><br /><p>NHS England’s 2015/16 Dementia Enhanced Service encourages GP practices to increase the health and wellbeing support offered to carers of patients diagnosed with dementia.</p><br /> <br />","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt","11242","2015-10-19T14:30:15.88Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420365/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420365/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/420365/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-10-09","Carers: Part-time Employment","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what support or respite care is available to full-time carers who wish to work part-time in addition to their caring responsibilities.","false","Biography information for Mr Roger Godsiff","Birmingham, Hall Green","Mr Roger Godsiff","11240"
