Heathrow is limited to 5,800 flights a year during these hours, which translates in to an average of 16 flights per night. Due to a voluntary agreement which prevents scheduled movements before 04.30, most of these flights are from aircraft arriving between the hours of 04.30 and 06.00.

Aircraft are certified by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) according to the noise they produce and the higher the band an aircraft is certified as the higher quota amount it uses with each movement. The Government has also prohibited the noisiest types of aircraft from using the airport during the night.

It is promoting the use of GRASP-AF (Guidance on Risk Assessment and Stroke Prevention for Atrial Fibrillation) within GP practices in England. GRASP-AF is an audit tool developed by and trialled in the NHS, which greatly simplifies the process of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation who are not receiving the right management to help reduce their risk of stroke. NHS IQ is currently collaborating with partner organisations, including charities, to support the nationwide roll-out of GRASP-AF.</p><p>To support this work, NHS IQ recently published an analysis of the costs and benefits of using the anticoagulant drug warfarin to help prevent stroke in people with AF. A copy of this analysis is attached.</p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also published a Quality Standard on atrial fibrillation in July 2015, which sets out what a high quality atrial fibrillation service should look like and will help drive improvement locally. A copy is attached. The Quality and Outcomes Framework contains indicators for the management of AF which cover the use of anticoagulation therapy. This provides a further incentive for doctors to ensure AF patients receive anticoagulation where appropriate to manage their risk of stroke.</p><p>Public Health England (PHE) has recently published their Atlas of Variation which includes data on atrial fibrillation. Full data for all 216 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) cannot be included in this reply due to its large size, but a map giving an overview of the results is attached. PHE have also collaborated with the Stroke Association to produce individualised CCG level reports on current performance in the detection and management of patients with atrial fibrillation to try and encourage poorly performing areas to improve.</p><p>The majority of the Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs) have made atrial fibrillation management a priority, and in London the three Academic Health Science Networks and the SCN have identified atrial fibrillation as being the first area where there is a collaborative effort to improve performance.</p><p>One of the options now available for clinicians managing patients with atrial fibrillation is the novel oral anticoagulants. These drugs are useful when patients are unable or unwilling to tolerate warfarin and should result in a greater proportion of the population with atrial fibrillation being effectively treated. Additionally, NICE have now approved the use of devices to self-monitor warfarin, reducing the need for patients to attend health centres for blood testing.

Private Acts of Parliament have been printed on archival quality paper since 1956, and I am not aware that vellum is now used for any other governmental or parliamentary records.</p><p>The National Archives have confirmed the view they took in 1999; that they do not require a vellum copy, and that archival quality paper is sufficient to maintain the public record.</p><p>Switching from vellum to high quality archival paper would, on a conservative estimate, save approximately 80% on current costs - or around Â£80,000 per year. The exact level of savings to public funds will depend on the number of Acts passed, and number of pages per Act, per year, and the precise specification and contractual arrangements agreed for future printing.</p><p>As well as being an expensive raw material, vellum requires a highly specialised form of printing which is not widely available, the machinery for which is expensive to maintain, and which is likely to be more difficult to procure on the expiry of the Houseâs current printing contract in March 2016.</p><p>As the start of a new Parliament seemed a natural point at which to implement the change previously agreed by this House, the main party Leaders, the Convenor and the Lord Speaker were consulted early in the present session, and the House Committee was informed in July 2015. I then wrote to the Chairman of the House of Commons Administration Committee on 17 September to invite that House to agree to the change.</p>",,"Lord Laming","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/429229/answer",,,,,,"2015-12-02T17:55:35.46Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/429229/answer","Biography information for Lord Laming","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/429229/answer",,,,,"200",,"Chairman of Committees (HoL)","2015-11-18","Public Acts","2","House of Lords","To ask the Chairman of Committees what consultation there has been about the proposals for record copies of public acts to be printed on paper rather than vellum.","false","Biography information for Lord Naseby",,"Lord Naseby","HL3713"

This is why the Government is committing to long-term investment in the Northern Powerhouse, in road and rail schemes, and is legislating to create Sub-National Transport Bodies.</p><br /><p>The Governmentâs <em>Road Investment Strategy (RIS) for the 2015 to 2020 Road Period</em> sets out plans for road schemes across the country. The strategy document is available at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/road-investment-strategy-for-the-2015-to-2020-road-period" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/road-investment-strategy-for-the-2015-to-2020-road-period</a>.</p><br /><p>A scheme for delivery in the first Road Period in Merseyside is the A5036 Princess Way â access to Port of Liverpool, a comprehensive upgrade to improve the main link between the Port of Liverpool and motorway network. Other schemes benefitting the wider Merseyside area include the upgrade to Smart Motorway of the M53 junctions 5 to 11 and the M6 junctions 21a to 26. Additionally, junction 22 of the M6 will be upgraded.</p><br /><p>Details of Local Growth Funds for the Merseyside area, which includes St Helens, are set out in the <em>Liverpool City Region: additional Growth Deal funding factsheet</em>, which is available at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-city-region-growth-deal" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-city-region-growth-deal</a>.</p><br /><p>This Growth Deal includes various transport schemes, in particular over Â£50m of government investment in key transport connections into and within Liverpool City Centre, revitalising the north of the city and better connecting Liverpoolâs iconic waterfront to the city centre. Additionally funding has been allocated to the A5300 Knowsley Expressway to maximise the benefits of the New Mersey crossing and access to Liverpool Airport; plus funding for development of a new station at Maghull North, improving transport across north Liverpool.</p><br /><p>The Government has also made a significant financial commitment to the Mersey Gateway Bridge which is currently under construction and which will improve accessibility across the wider Liverpool city region area. The Thornton to Switch Island link road in Sefton, to relieve congestion in the area and improve highway access between Southport and the North-West motorway system, has also recently been completed after receiving Â£14.5 million of government funding.</p><br /><p>The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has been allocated around Â£88million in local highways maintenance funding for the period 2015/16 to 2020/21, which builds on the around Â£70million of local highways maintenance funding invested in Merseyside from 2010/11 to 2014/15.</p><br /><p>St Helens and Liverpool City Region will benefit from the North of England Rail Infrastructure Upgrade Programme. North West Electrification has recently been completed between Liverpool and Manchesterand Liverpool and Wigan and Northern Electric services serve the St Helens North constituency.</p><br /><p>Liverpool City Region recently signed a devolution deal which will allow local authorities to take on responsibility for local issues on an unprecedented level. The region will also have an elected Mayor. This devolution of powers is part of the Governmentâs strategy to create a Northern Powerhouse which will enable the North to work together and become greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p><strong></strong></p>","Harrogate and Knaresborough","Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/428718/answer",,,,,,"2015-11-20T13:33:22.153Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/428718/answer","Biography information for Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/428718/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2015-11-17","Transport: Merseyside","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what investment in transport services the Government plans to make in (a) St Helens North constituency and (b) Merseyside as part of the Northern Powerhouse initiative.","false","Biography information for Conor McGinn","St Helens North","Conor McGinn","16605"

The principles are:</p><br /><p>âNHS organisations should work with their patients and staff, local authorities and public transport providers to make sure that users can get to the site (and park if necessary) as safely, conveniently and economically as possible.<sup>1</sup></p><br /><p>Charges should be reasonable for the area.</p><p>Concessions, including free or reduced charges or caps, should be available for the following groups:</p><ul><li>disabled people<sup>2</sup></li><li>frequent outpatient attenders</li><li>visitors with relatives who are gravely ill, or carers<sup>3</sup> of such people</li><li>visitors to relatives who have an extended stay in hospital, or carers<sup>3</sup> of such people</li><li>carers<sup>3</sup> of people in the above groups where appropriate</li><li>staff working shifts that mean public transport cannot be used</li></ul><br /><p>Other concessions, eg for volunteers or staff who car-share, should be considered locally.</p><br /><p>Priority for staff parking should be based on need, eg staff whose daily duties require them to travel by car.<sup>4</sup></p><br /><p>Trusts should consider installing âpay on exitâ or similar schemes so that drivers pay only for the time that they have used. Additional charges should only be imposed where reasonable<sup>5 </sup>and should be waived when overstaying is beyond the driverâs control (eg when treatment takes longer than planned, or when staff are required to work beyond their scheduled shift).</p><br /><p>Details of charges, concessions and additional charges should be well publicised including at car park entrances, wherever payment is made and inside the hospital. They should also be included on the hospital website and on patient letters and forms, where appropriate.</p><br /><p>NHS trusts should publish:</p><ul><li>their parking policy</li><li>their implementation of the NHS car parking principles</li><li>financial information relating to their car parking</li><li>summarised complaint information on car parking and actions taken in response</li></ul><br /> Contracted-out car parking<p>NHS organisations are responsible for the actions of private contractors who run car parks on their behalf.</p><p>NHS organisations should act against rogue contractors in line with the relevant codes of practice<sup>6 </sup>where applicable.</p><p>Contracts should not be let on any basis that incentivises additional charges, eg âincome from parking charge notices onlyâ.â</p><br /><p>To help NHS organisations deliver the above principles the Department published <em>NHS Car Parking Management: Environment and Sustainability (HTM 07-03)</em> on 25 March 2015. This guidance is attached.</p><br /><p>Both documents make it clear that National Health Service organisations should work with patients, staff, visitors, local authorities and public transport providers when planning their parking provision.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ol><li>Each site is different and very few will be able to provide spaces for everyone who needs one. Since 2010, national planning policy no longer imposes maximum parking standards on development, and no longer recommends the use of car parking charges as a demand management measure to discourage car use.</li></ol><br /><ol start="2"><li>Consideration should be given to the needs of people with temporary disabilities as well as Blue Badge holders.</li></ol><br /><ol start="3"><li>Carers are those as identified in the following:</li></ol><p>(i) Care Act 2014 section 10(3)</p><p>(ii) Children and Families Act 2014 section 96</p><p>(iii) Children and Families Act 2014 section 97</p><p>(iv) Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995</p><br /><ol start="4"><li>Such staff might include nurses or therapists who visit patients at home. Routine travel between hospital sites might more sensibly be managed by providing internal transport.</li></ol><br /><ol start="5"><li>âReasonableâ implementation of additional charges practice might include additional charges for people who do not have legitimate reasons for parking (eg commuters), or who persistently flout parking regulations (eg blocking entrances). A period of grace should normally be applied before a parking charge notice is issued.</li></ol><br /><ol start="6"><li>There are two trade associations: the British Parking Association and the Independent Parking Committee. If the car park operator is a member of either, their relevant code applies and an appeals service is available to motorists. NHS organisations should consider imposing a requirement for contractors to be members of such an association.</li></ol><p><strong></strong></p>",,"Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/428936/answer","HL3659 - Car Parking Principles scan.pdf ; HTM 07 03 NHS car parking management.pdf","HL3659 - Car Parking Principles scan.pdf ; HTM 07 03 NHS car parking management.pdf","Car Parking principles ; Car Parking management","Car Parking principles ; Car Parking management",,"2015-11-23T15:09:43.45Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/428936/answer","Biography information for Lord Prior of Brampton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/428936/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-11-17","Hospitals: Parking","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majestyâs Government what assessment they have made of the impact of hospital trusts charging disabled people to park their cars on those people.","false","Biography information for Baroness Kennedy of Cradley",,"Baroness Kennedy of Cradley","HL3659"
