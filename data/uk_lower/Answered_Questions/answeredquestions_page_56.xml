The Department works closely with NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) to support delivery of the Mandate and system objectives.</p><p> </p><p>The PHE report, Deaths associated with neurological conditions in England 2001 to 2014, was developed by PHE’s Neurology Intelligence Network (NIN), and published on 27 February 2018. The report found that a greater proportion of epilepsy related deaths occur in areas of higher levels of deprivation. The rate of deaths associated with epilepsy in areas ranked as the most deprived in England is almost three times larger than in the least deprived; 13 deaths per 100,000 population compared to 5 deaths per 100,000 population. A copy of the report can be found at the following link:</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions" target="_blank">www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-associated-with-neurological-conditions</a></p><p> </p><p>Wider research has shown that epilepsy prevalence varies with social deprivation, but this is not well understood, and it is not clear whether this inequality in mortality is the consequence of the increased prevalence seen in deprived areas, of poor care, or both. However, deprivation is a well-known determinant of poor general health, and although there is insufficient evidence to describe the relationship as causal, it underlines the health inequalities link in relation to epilepsy related deaths.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is acting broadly to reduce health inequalities by addressing the social causes of ill health, promoting healthier lifestyles for all and tackling differences in outcomes of NHS services, all underpinned by legal duties. Through the Mandate the Government has asked NHS England to ensure service commissioning focuses on measurable reductions in inequalities in access to health services, in people’s experience of the health system, and across a specified range of health outcomes which contribute to reducing inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. National and local outcomes frameworks feature indicators to measure improvements across a range of areas, including inequalities, and the Mandate asks NHS England to do more in increasing the transparency on services and outcomes that these frameworks provide.</p><p> </p><p>At a national level, NHS England is the organisation responsible for securing and supporting high quality outcomes for people with epilepsy, and the vast majority of services for people with the condition are planned and commissioned by local clinical commissioning groups. Action is led locally to ensure the solutions put in place reflect the needs of individual communities.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England’s RightCare programme provides practical support to local commissioners to tackle unwarranted variation, including in services for neurological conditions like epilepsy. NHS England is also working with the Neurological Alliance to support the Neurology Advisory Group, led by Professor Adrian Williams, to align work across the system to improve neurological care.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1104760","Department for Education","false","2019-04-02","<p>Sex education has been compulsory in all maintained secondary schools since 1993. It is not compulsory in primary schools and will not be once the proposed new subjects of Relationships Education and Relationships and Sex Education become compulsory. The statutory sex and relationships education (SRE) guidance (2000) states that maintained schools must have an up-to-date policy that sets out the school’s approach to sex education and that they should consult their pupils’ parents on this, making the policy available to parents. It is for schools to determine what range of information they provide to parents, but they must have regard to statutory guidance.</p><p>The Government is now making Relationships Education compulsory for all primary pupils, Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) compulsory for all secondary pupils and Health Education compulsory for all pupils in primary and secondary state funded schools from September 2020.</p><p>All schools will be required to have in place a written policy for Relationships Education and for RSE. Schools must consult parents in developing and reviewing their policy. Schools should ensure that the policy meets the needs of pupils and parents and reflects the community they serve. Schools should also ensure that the policy sets out the content of the subjects, how the content is taught and who is responsible for teaching it. The draft guidance is clear that schools should ensure that, when they consult parents, they provide examples of the resources they plan to use. Schools should assess each resource that they propose to use to ensure that it is appropriate for the age and maturity of pupils, and is sensitive to their needs.</p><p>The key decisions on these subjects and the drafting of the guidance were informed by a thorough engagement process. The public call for evidence was launched in December 2017 and received over 23,000 responses from parents, young people and schools. The Department engaged with 90 organisations representing a broad range of views and a broad range of evidence. These stakeholders can be found in the Government response to the Call for Evidence at: <a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/pshe/relationships-education-rse-health-education/supporting_documents/180718%20Consultation_call%20for%20evidence%20response_policy%20statement.pdf" target="_blank">https://consult.education.gov.uk/pshe/relationships-education-rse-health-education/supporting_documents/180718%20Consultation_call%20for%20evidence%20response_policy%20statement.pdf</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The revised draft guidance was not shared publicly between the close of the consultation and it being finalised following decisions by Ministers in light of the consultation responses.

It is not compulsory in primary schools and will not be once the proposed new subjects of Relationships Education and Relationships and Sex Education become compulsory. The statutory sex and relationships education (SRE) guidance (2000) states that maintained schools must have an up-to-date policy that sets out the school’s approach to sex education and that they should consult their pupils’ parents on this, making the policy available to parents. It is for schools to determine what range of information they provide to parents, but they must have regard to statutory guidance.</p><p>The Government is now making Relationships Education compulsory for all primary pupils, Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) compulsory for all secondary pupils and Health Education compulsory for all pupils in primary and secondary state funded schools from September 2020.</p><p>All schools will be required to have in place a written policy for Relationships Education and for RSE. Schools must consult parents in developing and reviewing their policy. Schools should ensure that the policy meets the needs of pupils and parents and reflects the community they serve. Schools should also ensure that the policy sets out the content of the subjects, how the content is taught and who is responsible for teaching it. The draft guidance is clear that schools should ensure that, when they consult parents, they provide examples of the resources they plan to use. Schools should assess each resource that they propose to use to ensure that it is appropriate for the age and maturity of pupils, and is sensitive to their needs.</p><p>The key decisions on these subjects and the drafting of the guidance were informed by a thorough engagement process. The public call for evidence was launched in December 2017 and received over 23,000 responses from parents, young people and schools. The Department engaged with 90 organisations representing a broad range of views and a broad range of evidence. These stakeholders can be found in the Government response to the Call for Evidence at: <a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/pshe/relationships-education-rse-health-education/supporting_documents/180718%20Consultation_call%20for%20evidence%20response_policy%20statement.pdf" target="_blank">https://consult.education.gov.uk/pshe/relationships-education-rse-health-education/supporting_documents/180718%20Consultation_call%20for%20evidence%20response_policy%20statement.pdf</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The revised draft guidance was not shared publicly between the close of the consultation and it being finalised following decisions by Ministers in light of the consultation responses.

It is also piloting teachers’ student loan reimbursement for languages and science teachers in 25 high need local authorities.</p><p>The Department is also investing more in challenging areas to create enhanced development and progression opportunities. For example, the Department is investing £20 million in scholarships to drive take up of the reformed leadership national professional qualifications in the most challenging areas.</p><p>The Department’s investment in Teach First (TF) also supports recruitment for schools in disadvantaged areas. The department funds TF to deliver an employment based route into teaching, with trainees completing a two year leadership development programme. It is a premium route into teaching, attracting high calibre trainees into the profession. In 2016/17, 93% of TF trainees had a 2:1 or above, compared with 73% across post graduate routes. These high quality trainees are placed in schools in disadvantaged areas that might otherwise struggle to attract this quality of applicant.</p><p>The Department recognises that some schools have greater issues with recruitment and retention than others.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1104890","Home Office","false","2019-03-28","<p>We are clear that robust and consistent sentences for knife crime are an important part of the effort needed to reduce these crimes. Right across Government we are very clear that we must continue to give judges the powers they need to impose tough sentences on those involved in serious violence including knife crime. While individual sentencing decisions are a matter for the courts, we are catching and prosecuting more people who carry a knife, and those who are convicted are now more likely to go to prison, and for longer. Through the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, the Government introduced the sentencing provision that anyone caught in possession of a knife for a second time will now face a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of at least six months for adults and a detention and training order of at least four months for those aged 16 and 17 years old. This came into force on 17 July 2015.</p><p>We know that this can only ever be part of the response, and that tackling knife crime requires action on many fronts. This is reflected in the Government’s Serious Violence Strategy which sets out our response to serious violence and outlines an ambitious programme involving 61 commitments and actions. Since launching the Strategy in April last year, we have made significant progress in delivering on our key commitments including:</p><p>• The Early Intervention Youth Fund of £22m, which is already supporting <br> 29 projects in England and Wales;<br>• Provision of £3.6m for a new National County Lines Co-ordination <br> Centre. The centre was established to tackle violent and exploitative <br> criminal activity associated with county lines and became fully <br> operational in September 2018;<br>• The National County Lines Coordination Centre has co-ordinated two <br> separate weeks of intensive law enforcement action resulting in more <br> than 1000 arrests, over 1300 individuals engaged for safeguarding, <br> and significant seizures of weapons and drugs; <br>• An anti-knife crime Community Fund which provided £1.5 million in <br> 2018/19 to support 68 projects;<br>• The Offensive Weapons Bill to strengthen legislation on firearms, <br> knives and corrosive substances; and<br>• A national knife crime media campaign - #knifefree - to raise <br> awareness of the consequences of knife crime.</p><p>On 2 October 2018 the Home Secretary announced further measures to address violent crime, as follows:</p><p>• a consultation on new legal duty to underpin a ‘public health’ approach to tackling serious violence- this would mean police officers, educa-tion partners, local authority and health care professionals will have a new legal duty to take action and prevent violent crime.</p><p>• a new £200 million youth endowment fund- this will be delivered over 10 years and will support interventions with children and young people at risk of involvement in crime and violence. It will focus on those most at risk, such as those displaying signs such as truancy, aggres-sion and involvement in anti-social behaviour; funding interventions to steer children and young people away from becoming serious offend-ers; and</p><p>• an Independent Review of Drug Misuse. On 8 February, we <br> appointed Dame Carol Black to lead a major review that will look into <br> the ways in which drugs are fuelling serious violence. The approach <br> establishes a new balance between prevention and the rigorous law <br> enforcement activity. It will shift our approach towards steering young <br> people away from crime in the first place and put in place measures <br> to tackle the root causes. We believe that the approach set out in the <br> Strategy, with a greater emphasis on early intervention, will address <br> violent crime and help young people to develop the skills and <br> resilience to live happy and productive lives away from violence but <br> we cannot deliver this alone.</p><p>On 13 March the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Spring Statement that there will be £100 million additional funding in 2019/20 to tackle serious violence, including £80m of new funding from the Treasury. This will allow police to swiftly crack-down on knife crime on the areas of the country and also allow investment in Violence Reduction Units.</p>","Louth and Horncastle","Victoria Atkins",,"2019-03-28T16:10:56.743Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1104890/answer","Biography information for Victoria Atkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1104890/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1104890/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2019-03-25","Knives: Crime","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what recent discussions he has had with the Lord Chancellor on the effectiveness of short custodial sentences for people convicted of knife offences in reducing levels of knife crime.","false","Biography information for Mr Ranil Jayawardena","North East Hampshire","Mr Ranil Jayawardena","236544"
