Higher education providers wishing to charge tuition fees above the basic fee level must have an Access Agreement, setting out their targets and planned expenditure to improve access for disadvantaged and under-represented groups, and approved by the DfA. Prior to approval, the Director negotiates with institutions to ensure that Access Agreements are stretching and appropriately demanding. Higher Education Institutions are independent from Government and autonomous - legislation specifically precludes Government from interfering with university admissions.</p><p>The proportion of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds going into higher education rose from 13.6% in 2009 to 19.5% in 2016 - an increase of 43%. We have also seen record entry rates for young people across all ethnic groups including at the most prestigious institutions, and record entry rates for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to the most selective universities. There is however, much more to do.</p><p> </p><p>In our guidance to the DfA, published in February 2016, we asked for the most selective institutions, which include the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, to make faster progress on widening access, and to ensure their outreach is more effective. The guidance acknowledged that within this group of institutions there is wide variation, with some demonstrating little progress.</p><p>Access agreements for the 2018/19 academic year show that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge plan to spend over £22 million on measures to further improve access and student success for students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds.</p><p>Following the introduction of the Higher Education and Research Act, from January 2018, the Office for Students (OfS), with a new Director for Fair Access and Participation appointed by my Rt Hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, will take on responsibility for widening participation in higher education. The OfS will have a statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity across the whole lifecycle for disadvantaged students, not just access. As a result, widening access and participation will be at the core of the OfS’ functions. In addition, our reforms will introduce a Transparency Duty requiring higher education providers to publish application, offer, acceptance, drop-out and attainment rates of students broken down by ethnicity, gender and socio-economic background. This will shine a spotlight on those higher education institutions that need to go further and faster to widen participation in higher education.</p>","Orpington","Joseph Johnson",,"2017-11-17T14:48:53.033Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/784853/answer","Biography information for Joseph  Johnson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/784853/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/784853/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2017-11-06","Universities: Admissions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, whether she has made an assessment of the effectiveness of steps taken by Oxford and Cambridge Universities to improve access and widen participation from under-represented groups; and if she will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Mr David Lammy","Tottenham","Mr David Lammy","111507"

The regime has used chemical weapons with devastating consequences, as confirmed in the most recent report of the Joint Investigative Mechanism. The regime also continues to deny humanitarian access to besieged populations. The UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria has documented the regime’s use of ‘massive and systematised’ violence against political detainees, and stated that the regime’s use of disappearance, torture, rape and sexual violence amount to crimes against humanity. Earlier this year Amnesty International reported that the regime had killed up to 13,000 people in just one prison.

In addition to this it is not possible to allocate spending precisely on a project that crosses and benefits many regions, for example HS2.</p><p> </p><p>This Department focuses on delivering outcomes for transport users, not on spending per head. An analysis of regional spend per head of resident population would not, for example, take into account the pressure that large numbers of commuters and visitors from outside of a region can add to a region’s transport networks. In addition, larger and more densely built-up areas tend to make greater use of mass public transport systems. For example, in 2015/16 there were 537 million rail journeys within the London area compared to 142 million in the North. Investment by the Department is made based on a fair and rigorous process that ensures that spending goes where it is most needed.</p><p>The Infrastructure and Projects Authority’s National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline (NICP) publishes a forward look of transport capital investment for 2016-17 to 2020-21. However, due to methodological challenges, the majority of public sector transport capital investment is not allocated to specific English regions.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/783181","Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","false","2017-11-13","<p>We recognise the importance of the permanent preservation of archives for long-term public benefit by museums, galleries, archives and libraries. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Bill permit such organisations to process personal data (including sensitive personal data) without consent, where necessary for “archiving purposes in the public interest”, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It also exempts archiving services from complying with certain rights of data subjects (for example, rights to access, rectify or erase their data), where the exercise of such rights would seriously impair or prevent them from fulfilling their objectives.</p><p> </p><p>‘Archiving in the public interest’ is a new term in data protection law. The Data Protection Act 1998 made no express reference to it and it is not defined in the GDPR, but Recital 158 to the GDPR may help to understand it. It says:</p><p> </p><p>“Public authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, have a legal obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote, disseminate and provide access to records of enduring public value for general public interest.”</p><p> </p><p>This is likely to apply to a wide variety of community, private, public sector, charitable/trust and voluntary sector archives. It could also include archives that may be closed to researchers at the present time, but which would become accessible at some future date, and archives which are held in analogue or digital format. The definition would not, however, cover organisations which gather and use data, information and records purely for their own commercial gain or that have no enduring public value.</p><p> </p><p>We recognise that concerns have been raised about the reference in the Recital to archiving organisations being under a ‘legal obligation’ to archive. While this may reflect the archival system in some other EU member states, it does not reflect the position in the UK. Many smaller archives, particularly in the private sector, are unlikely to have any statutory obligations to archive.</p><p> </p><p>We do not think the best approach is to create new statutory duties requiring organisations to archive. This could force organisations to archive that had no intention or means of doing so. Instead, we want to reassure bona fide archiving services that they will be able to continue to process personal data for the purposes of archiving in the public interest, regardless of whether they have a statutory obligation to do so. The reasons for this are:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Recitals act as explanatory notes to European regulations and have no direct legal effect. They may be taken into account by regulators and the courts when interpreting and applying the law, but they are not the law.</li><li>In any event Recital 158 should be read in conjunction with Recital 41 which says that “where this regulation refers to a legal basis or legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament”, providing that such a legal basis is clear and precise and its application is foreseeable to persons subject to it.</li><li>In the UK, most archives operate on a permissive basis under the general provisions of common law or statutory permissive powers, such as the British Library Act 1972 or the Local Government (Records) Act 1962. It may be open to organisations to rely on such a basis to satisfy the requirements of Recital 158.</li><li>Where there are no clear permissive powers, organisations may still be able to point to funding agreements, management agreements or constitutional documents which set out the purposes of the archive, particularly if the failure to adhere to such purposes could have legal or quasi-legal effects, for example for a body’s charitable status. Although this may not amount to a statutory obligation to archive, it would give organisations a legal basis upon which to rely.</li><li>Up until now, organisations responsible for archiving may have relied on exemptions from subject access rights under the ‘historical research’ provisions in section 33 of the Data Protection Act 1998. These provisions will continue in the new Data Protection Bill, and have not been abolished by GDPR. Most of the exemptions from data subjects’ rights in relation to archiving also exist in relation to historical research. If archiving services cannot confidently rely on the exemptions for archiving in the public interest, they may be able to rely on exemptions for historical research as an alternative. We recognise that there is some debate about this point within the sector because some archives may not exist for historical research purposes. In that case, a legal basis for archiving will be needed, but it does not need to be statutory.</li></ul>","West Suffolk","Matt Hancock",,"2017-11-13T18:35:30.787Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/783181/answer","Biography information for Matt Hancock","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/783181/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/783181/answer",,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2017-11-03","Archives: Public Interest","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, what definition her Department uses for the phrase archiving in the public interest.","false","Biography information for Nick Thomas-Symonds","Torfaen","Nick Thomas-Symonds","111381"
