The CQC published this report in October 2016 and this report provides the most comprehensive view yet of what the CQC’s expert-led inspections have found. The report includes analysis of information up to 31 July 2016; at that point the CQC had inspected and rated more than 16,000 adult social care services, including, 9,100 residential homes and 3,649 nursing homes. A copy of the CQC’s <em>The state of health care and adult social care in England Care Report 2015/16</em> is attached.</p><p> </p><p>Despite challenging conditions, adult social care services have so far been able to maintain quality. The CQC observed that 71% received a ‘Good’ rating overall and 1% were rated as ‘Outstanding’. 26% of services were rated as ‘Requires Improvement’ and 2% of services were rated ‘Inadequate’. This figure was much lower than last year’s figure of 7% of services rated ‘Inadequate’. Three-quarters of those that we had rated as ‘Inadequate’, and then re-inspected, improved, but a quarter of services originally rated ‘Inadequate’ did not improve enough to change their overall rating on re-inspection.</p><p> </p><p>Since the publication of the 2016 State of Care report, the CQC has completed its comprehensive programme of inspecting all adult social care services locations in England that were registered before 1 October 2014.
