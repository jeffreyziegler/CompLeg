A recent report by UNICEF and the Afghan Ministry of Education estimates that nearly half of school-age children – some 3.7 million children - are out of school. Approximately 60% of Afghanistan’s out-of-school-children are girls. There are too few schools in Afghanistan, and many children cannot access school without travelling long distances over insecure environments. Educational provision often does not take into account the particular needs of girls: for example schools in many provinces lack female teachers, sanitation facilities and boundary walls. The UK is supporting the Government of Afghanistan to improve access to education services for all – particularly girls and the most marginalised – and to improve the <em>quality</em> of those services.

The Department of Health and Social Care provides funding to build supported and specialised housing - through the Care and Support Specialised Housing Fund - for older people and those with learning and physical disabilities, and mental ill health. In addition, from October 2018, all National Health Service and foundation trusts including mental health trusts will have a ‘duty to refer’ people at risk of homelessness to local authorities.</p><p> </p><p>The NHS already provides some services to people who may be experiencing the symptoms of debt problems or financial difficulties. We are aware that some general practitioner (GP) practices signpost patients to debt advice services as part of their care and some practices have arrangements in place with local Citizens Advice Bureaux and debt advice services to provide outreach support in primary care. Mental health services, including Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services, may also signpost patients to debt advice services as part of their care.</p><p> </p><p>In January 2017, the Prime Minister announced the Government would review the practice of GPs charging patients experiencing debt issues to complete Mental Health Evidence Forms when they require medical evidence for their creditors. The Department of Health and Social Care is working with the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute and a range of stakeholders from the financial and debt advice sectors to undertake the review, which we will publish in due course.</p><p> </p><p>In October 2017, we published ‘Thriving at Work: The Stevenson / Farmer review of mental health and employers’. The review set out a compelling business case for action, with the central recommendation that all employers should adopt a set of core mental health standards to encourage an open and transparent organisational culture that supports employees’ mental health. Further to this, public sector and private sector companies with more than 500 employees should adopt a package of enhanced mental health standards to improve disclosure processes and provide tailored mental health support. The Government fully supports the review in encouraging all employers to adopt the mental health standards and we are committed to championing the review and standards.</p><p> </p><p>The Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Work and Pensions are investing up to £115 million of programme funding to support the work and health agenda to enable investment in new models and to build the evidence of what works.

A key reason for this was because we have radically reformed what an apprenticeship is. The old apprenticeship frameworks were said by employers not to be equipping apprentices to do the job. Training was often of poor quality or was non-existent. Instead, we are asking employers to lead the design of new apprenticeship standards, putting them in the driving seat to give apprentices the skills that businesses need. The number of people starting on these new standards is growing fast. Over 40% of individuals completing an apprenticeship are now starting on new standards, compared to 2.5% this time last year.</p><p>We are creating quality apprenticeships that will change the lives of apprentices and the prospects of businesses and we are continuing to take steps to grow apprenticeships starts. The Institute for Apprenticeships have introduced their Faster and Better process to speed up and simplify standards development.</p><p>The apprenticeship levy is an important part of the changes to raise apprenticeship quality; creating long-term, sustainable investment in training. Only around 2% of employers pay the levy, but they have generated almost 50% of starts so far in 2017/18. We will continue to work closely with employers to help them take advantage of the levy and wider funding changes, to invest in the long-term skills needs of their business.</p><p>We recognise that employers want and need flexibility. We have already extended the amount of time employers have to spend their levy (from 18 to 24 months), and have introduced transfers, to make the system as effective as possible. We will avoid making any changes that could compromise the quality of apprenticeships. We will keep listening to employers’ feedback as the system develops further. We also meet regularly with business groups and individual employers to understand the impact of the changes and use their feedback to inform any further reforms.</p><p>The changes we have made to the apprenticeship system are transforming lives. Few countries can match the energy and range of reforms currently being pursued in England. We are helping employers to create high quality apprenticeships at all levels that give people of all ages and backgrounds the skills they need.</p><p>We are using the employer Diversity Champions, comprised of over 65 members including employers, local authorities and schools, has been developed to engage and inspire employers and communities to ensure apprenticeships are undertaken by people from a diverse range of backgrounds, reflecting the widest spectrum of our society.</p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton",,"2018-07-25T15:40:35.303Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942045/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942045/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942045/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-07-16","Apprentices","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the numbers of apprenticeship starts have decreased since the introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy; what factors have contributed to any such decrease; and what steps they are taking to increase the number of apprenticeship starts.","false","Biography information for Lord Ouseley",,"Lord Ouseley","HL9559"

This outlines our reform programme which seeks to: improve the quality of social work practice; create systems and environments where great social work can flourish; promote learning and multi-agency working where all involved in supporting children and families can work together; and support children who both enter and leave the care system.</p><p>The 2015 Spending Review made available more than £200 billion until 2020 for councils to deliver the local services their communities want to see, including children’s services. In February, Parliament confirmed the 2018-19 settlement for local government, which has provided a £1.3 billion increase in resources to local government over the next two years, from £44.3 billion in 2017-18 to £45.6 billion in 2019-20. In addition, the current business rates retention scheme is yielding strong results. Local authorities estimate that in 2018-19 they will keep around £2.4 billion in business rates growth. This is on top of the core settlement funding. Funding for children’s services is an un-ring fenced part of the wider local government finance settlement. Local authorities have used this flexibility to increase spending on the most vulnerable children by around a £1 billion since 2010.</p>",,"Lord Agnew of Oulton",,"2018-07-25T13:07:13.263Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942049/answer","Biography information for Lord Agnew of Oulton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942049/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942049/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-07-16","Children: Social Services","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what measures they plan to put in place to prevent vulnerable children being taken into local authority care for their own safety due to underfunded local safeguarding services.","false","Biography information for Lord Ouseley",,"Lord Ouseley","HL9563"

This includes One Public Estate (OPE) and Places for Growth (PfG), which support economic growth, the delivery of more accessible public services and the creation of clusters of government jobs and expertise in cities across the UK.</p><p>The OPE programme is a key contributor to growth and regeneration across cities in England and fosters collaboration between local and central Government partners. For example, in York OPE is supporting public sector partners to deliver an ambitious town centre regeneration scheme by redeveloping a 72 hectare site surrounding York Railway station. This is expected to deliver up to 1500 new homes and 100,000 square metres of commercial space.</p><p>To support economic growth across the UK, the PfG Programme has been established to drive delivery of the Government’s commitment to move civil service jobs, including senior roles, out of London and the South East. PfG are taking a place-based approach to inform the decision-making process around any relocation of public bodies rather than selecting locations solely on estate provision. Ultimately, we want organisations to go to cities that have existing skills and capacity to enable them to flourish.</p>","Hertsmere","Oliver Dowden",,"2018-07-23T11:55:42.87Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942580/answer","Biography information for Oliver Dowden","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942580/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/942580/answer",,,,,"53","Cabinet Office","Cabinet Office","2018-07-16","Government Departments: Location","1","House of Commons","To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, whether his Department plans to establish a strategy for other cities similar to that for enhancing the heart of London set out in the Government's Estate Strategy of July 2018.","false","Biography information for Jon Trickett","Hemsworth","Jon Trickett","164281"

We have already seen the numbers of starts at higher levels (level 4 and above) rise by 12.5 per cent so far this year, compared to the same period last year. We are seeing a healthier balance across all levels, helping people of all ages progress to higher skills.</p><p>We provide funding to support all young people access apprenticeships. To encourage the employment of young apprentices, the government provides £1,000 payments to both employers and providers when taking on a 16 to 18 year old apprentice. The government also pays 100 per cent of the cost of training for small employers (fewer than 50 employees) who take on a 16 to 18 year old apprentice. This also applies to 19 to 24 year olds who were in care or who have an Education, Health and Care plan. In addition, from August 2018, we are introducing a bursary for care leavers starting apprenticeships. This bursary will be £1,000, available to all care leavers aged 16 to 24 year olds and paid direct to them.</p><p>Apprenticeships disproportionately benefit people from lower socio-economic backgrounds – delivering more, better quality, apprenticeships will ensure that more people from these backgrounds are enabled to gain the skills and training they need to build successful careers. We provide additional funding support for individuals from disadvantaged areas, by providing a cash payment to providers for training apprentices on frameworks who live in the top 27 per cent of deprived areas.</p><p>We are increasing the take up of degree apprenticeships through the Degree Apprenticeship Development Fund, by funding projects that include encouraging participation of under-represented groups in disadvantaged areas.</p><p>To promote apprenticeships and encourage take up at all levels, we are targeting employers, parents and young people using proven channels: radio adverts, digital advertising, social media and telemarketing activity. The latest phase of our ‘Get in Go Far’ marketing campaign will launch shortly. We are also taking specific actions to increase starts in the 16 to 18 age group; undertaking sales and marketing activities, targeting employers most likely to offer apprenticeships to this group, and working with organisations that provide careers advice.</p><p>The National Apprenticeship service has developed the ‘Amazing Apprenticeships’ website and apprenticeship resource portal for schools and teachers.
