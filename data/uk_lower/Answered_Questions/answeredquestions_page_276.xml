HMRC and Border Force work closely with other enforcement agencies, including Trading Standards and the police to target those involved in the fraud. Since 2000, the illicit market for cigarettes has reduced from 22% to 13% and for hand rolling tobacco from 61% to 32%.</p><p> </p><p>There is a wide range of sanctions available to tackle the sale of illicit tobacco (and alcohol) including seizure of products and cash, financial penalties and a maximum penalty of seven year’s imprisonment.

Anyone over the age of 74 can self refer themselves into the screening programme every two years.</p><p> </p><p>The programme initially offered screening to men and women aged 60 to 69 years old because the risk of bowel cancer increases with age, with over 80% of bowel cancers being diagnosed in people who are aged 60 or over. In the bowel cancer screening pilot, conducted in Coventry and Warwickshire and in Scotland in the late 1990s and early 2000s, over three times more cancers were detected in people aged over 60 than under 60, and people in their 60s were most likely to use a testing kit. In addition, there was not enough endoscopy resource to begin at a wider age range. Men and women aged over 70 have always been able to self-refer for screening every two years if they wish. The programme has now been extended to men and women aged up to 74.</p><p> </p><p>In November 2015, the UK National Screening Committee which advises Ministers and the National Health Service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy, recommended that the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) should replace the currently used FOB test in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Bowel cancer screening using the FIT self-sampling kit will be offered to men and women aged 60 to 74 every two years. Anyone over the age of 74 will still be able to self refer into the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme every two years. FIT is expected to increase screening uptake by around 10% and result in around 200,000 more people a year being tested, potentially saving hundreds of lives. FIT will be implemented from April 2018.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to FOB testing the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is currently rolling out Bowel Scope Screening (BSS), a one off examination which will play a significant role in preventing bowel cancer. Both men and women will be invited for BSS around the time of their 55th birthday. If people are not screened at 55, they can request BSS up to the age of 59. BSS finds and removes any small bowel growths (polyps) that could eventually turn into cancer.</p><p> </p><p>We believe the biggest impact we can have on saving lives from bowel cancer in England is implementing FIT in 2018 and roll-out of BSS to all men and women aged 55.</p>","Warrington South","David Mowat",,"2017-02-02T16:29:22.863Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678655/answer","Biography information for David Mowat","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678655/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678655/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-01-25","Bowel Cancer: Screening","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what assessment his Department has made of the merits of reducing the age for screening for bowel cancer to people aged 50.","false","Biography information for Mr Andrew Smith","Oxford East","Mr Andrew Smith","61685"

One of these measures was the introduction of the option of waiting periods for the automatic enrolment of workers into a workplace pension. This helps to reduce burdens on employers by allowing them the flexibility to postpone automatic enrolment if they have temporary or short-term staff who will stop working within three months, need to align automatic enrolment with their other business processes (e.g., payroll), or for any other business reason, while balancing the risk of individuals being excluded from pension saving for extended periods of time.</p><p> </p><p>It is important to note, however, that workers can still ask to join the employer’s workplace pension scheme during the postponement period.

In line with this, all STPs are expected to set out plans to make progress in the following key areas:</p><p> </p><p>- Preventing cancer by addressing cancer risk factors – especially smoking; all areas should take steps to reduce national rate by the end of the decade;<br></p><p>- Diagnosing more cancers early, increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage 1 and 2. STPs need to improve their cancer pathways as well as substantially increasing diagnostic capacity (especially imaging and endoscopy). These actions will result in fewer cancers diagnosed as an emergency, and an increase in one and five-year survival rates. By 2020, everyone with a suspected cancer should receive a definitive diagnosis or otherwise within 28 days; and</p><p> </p><p>- Improving cancer treatment and care. By 2020, all patients should have access to high quality modern therapeutic services, such as personalised treatment informed by molecular diagnostics. They will be cared for during and after their treatment, benefiting from increased support to live well after treatment. Patients will have a better experience of their cancer care, with less variation across the country.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England established an independent Cancer Taskforce chaired by Harpal Kumar, Chief Executive of Cancer Research UK, to support the development of this strategy. This included representatives from across the cancer community and engaged with hundreds of people, including clinicians, patients, charity representatives and policy-makers, over a six month period.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The National End of Life Care Programme Board is seeking to understand the end of life care (EoLC) content within the current plans; they are also considering how priorities within STPs can be achieved by delivering good EoLC and what support is available to enable this.

Anyone over the age of 74 can self refer themselves into the screening programme every two years.</p><p> </p><p>The programme initially offered screening to men and women aged 60 to 69 years old because the risk of bowel cancer increases with age, with over 80% of bowel cancers being diagnosed in people who are aged 60 or over. In the bowel cancer screening pilot, conducted in Coventry and Warwickshire and in Scotland in the late 1990s and early 2000s, over three times more cancers were detected in people aged over 60 than under 60, and people in their 60s were most likely to use a testing kit. In addition, there was not enough endoscopy resource to begin at a wider age range. Men and women aged over 70 have always been able to self-refer for screening every two years if they wish. The programme has now been extended to men and women aged up to 74.</p><p> </p><p>In November 2015, the UK National Screening Committee which advises Ministers and the National Health Service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy, recommended that the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) should replace the currently used FOB test in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Bowel cancer screening using the FIT self-sampling kit will be offered to men and women aged 60 to 74 every two years. Anyone over the age of 74 will still be able to self refer into the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme every two years. FIT is expected to increase screening uptake by around 10% and result in around 200,000 more people a year being tested, potentially saving hundreds of lives. FIT will be implemented from April 2018.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to FOB testing the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is currently rolling out Bowel Scope Screening (BSS), a one off examination which will play a significant role in preventing bowel cancer. Both men and women will be invited for BSS around the time of their 55th birthday. If people are not screened at 55, they can request BSS up to the age of 59. BSS finds and removes any small bowel growths (polyps) that could eventually turn into cancer.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>We believe the biggest impact we can have on saving lives from bowel cancer in England is implementing FIT in 2018 and roll-out of BSS to all men and women aged 55.</p>",,"Lord O'Shaughnessy",,"2017-02-07T13:18:44.33Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678856/answer","Biography information for Lord O'Shaughnessy","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678856/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678856/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-01-25","Bowel Cancer: Screening","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they have to reduce the age at which bowel cancer screening takes place from 60 to 50.","false","Biography information for Baroness Redfern",,"Baroness Redfern","HL5007"

The December 2014 agreement with the four UK mobile network operators (MNOs) means that each mobile operator has a legally binding licence obligation to provide coverage to at least 90% of UK landmass by end 2017. Additionally O2 has a licence obligation to provide indoor 4G coverage to 98% of premises, also by the end of 2017. These obligations will be enforced by Ofcom who will have a new power, under the Digital Economy Bill, to fine operators if they fail to meet these targets. The licence obligations arising from the December 2014 agreement, have locked in investment of £5 billion and are delivering improved coverage across the UK. Ofcom's 2016 Connected Nations Report shows that 99% of UK premises now have indoor voice coverage and 96% have indoor 4G data coverage. Our recent reforms to mobile planning laws in England and proposed reforms of the Electronic Communications Code, will support further investment and improvements in connectivity across the UK and reduce not spots.</p><p> </p><p> </p>","West Suffolk","Matt Hancock",,"2017-02-01T13:32:38.597Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/677953/answer","Biography information for Matt Hancock","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/677953/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/677953/answer",,,,,"10","Culture, Media and Sport","Culture, Media and Sport","2017-01-24","Mobile Phones: Radio Frequencies","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, what steps the Government is taking to improve 4G coverage in the UK.","false","Biography information for Jim Shannon","Strangford","Jim Shannon","61514"

It is a basic condition of entitlement that a person be in Great Britain to receive it. Although Pension Credit is not intended to subsidise absences from Great Britain, in certain circumstances entitlement to the benefit can continue during a temporary absence abroad.</p><p> </p><p>It is the Government’s view that the current rule, which allows entitlement to continue for up to four consecutive weeks during a period of absence from Great Britain, is reasonable and justified.

There are exceptions to the general four week rule. Pension Credit can continue for up to 26 weeks where medical treatment or medically approved convalescence is required outside Great Britain. Where the absence is in connection with a death of a partner or close relative then entitlement can continue for up to eight weeks.</p><p> </p><p>This approach aligns Pension Credit and Housing Benefit with Universal Credit and provides consistency across these benefits and we have no plans to change this.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>","Watford","Richard Harrington",,"2017-01-30T17:15:21.027Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678125/answer","Biography information for Richard Harrington","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678125/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/678125/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2017-01-24","Pension Credit: British Nationals Abroad","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will take steps to allow people temporarily living abroad to claim pension credit for longer.","false","Biography information for Diana Johnson","Kingston upon Hull North","Diana Johnson","61407"
