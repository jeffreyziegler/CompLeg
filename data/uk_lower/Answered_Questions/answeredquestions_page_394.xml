It would not have been appropriate to impose a blanket ban on charging for carers services, because in some cases small charges are necessary to the viability of services. However, the Care Act provides additional protection to carers by making it clear that local authorities cannot charge carers for services provided to the person being cared for.

That is why we have made significant policy interventions in areas such as improving pupil behaviour and tackling unnecessary workload for teachers.</p>","Bognor Regis and Littlehampton","Nick Gibb",,"2015-10-29T16:49:12.923Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423826/answer","Biography information for Nick Gibb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423826/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423826/answer",,,,,,,,,"60","Education","Education","2015-10-26","Teachers: Training","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps her Department is taking to encourage more people to train as teachers.","false","Biography information for Mr Jamie Reed","Copeland","Mr Jamie Reed","13479"

Nationally, the Task Group has developed a number of strategic, church-led initiatives, including matching the resources of local churches with the diverse needs of local credit unions through the Church Credit Champions Network. To date, the pilot scheme has engaged over 200 churches, trained 150 Credit Champions and is on target to bring in 3,000+ new credit union members across London, Southwark and Liverpool dioceses, with plans to roll out to 30 more dioceses from next year.</p><p>The Church of England is also running the ‘LifeSavers’ programme which is piloting a holistic financial education programme linked to savings clubs in primary schools. This was trialled successfully in Church of England primary schools during 2015 and will be rolled out to a further 120 church and community schools from early 2016, helping to raise the profile of credit unions in these communities.</p><p>Locally, dioceses and churches are involved in a wide range of activities in support of credit unions, from running mass sign-ups and marketing campaigns and recruiting volunteers to the board of credit unions to hosting access points in church building and promoting payroll saving through links with local employers. According to a Church Urban Fund survey, 17% of Anglican parishes are actively involved in supporting credit unions in various ways. This activity has generated widespread coverage in national and local media, raising public awareness of credit unions.

The government, through its support of bursaries and other workforce programmes, provided 199 bursaries to individuals to become maths teachers in the Further Education sector in 2013/14 and 2014/15, and also supported 2450 existing teachers to take maths enhancement programmes.</p><br /><p>Area Reviews of Post-16 education and training are aimed at delivering a skills system that meets the economic and educational needs of areas. All reviews will include consideration of the need for sufficient, high quality maths and English teaching. As independent organisations, colleges and providers will determine the number of teachers they need to deliver this provision.</p><br />","Grantham and Stamford","Nick Boles","13325 ; 13447 ; 13448","2015-11-03T14:10:50.96Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423868/answer","Biography information for Nick Boles","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423868/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423868/answer",,,,,,,,,"26","Business, Innovation and Skills","Business, Innovation and Skills","2015-10-26","Further Education: Teachers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, how many teachers were employed in teaching English language subjects in the further education sector in England at the start of (a) 2010-11, (b) 2011-12, (c) 2012-13, (d) 2013-14, (e) 2014-15 and (f) 2015-16 academic years.","false","Biography information for Gordon Marsden","Blackpool South","Gordon Marsden","13326"

Some information on cost is also available but this is the cost of the medicines at NHS list price and not necessarily the price that hospitals paid.</p><br /><p>In guidance published in August 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advised that vedolizumab is the recommended treatment for adults with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease if a type of treatment called a tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor is not suitable or has not worked well enough. NICE also recommend vedolizumab as a possible treatment for adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in separate guidance published on 5 June 2015.</p><br /><p>In both cases, people should be able to have vedolizumab until it stops working, or surgery is needed, or for 12 months after starting it, whichever is shorter. Their condition should be assessed 12 months after they started taking vedolizumab. If they still have symptoms but it is clear that the treatment is helping, they can continue to have the drug. If they no longer have symptoms, treatment can be stopped, and later restarted if their symptoms return.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423574","Department of Health","false","2015-10-28","<p>The Government recognises the valuable contribution made by carers, many of whom spend a significant proportion of their life providing support to family members or friends.</p><br /><p>The Care Act guidance is clear about policy on charging carers. The Care Act statutory guidance, at paragraph 8.50 states that:</p><br /><p>“Local authorities are not required to charge a carer for support and indeed in many cases it would be a false economy to do so. When deciding whether to charge, and in determining what an appropriate charge is, a local authority should consider how it wishes to express the way it values carers within its local community as partners in care, and recognise the significant contribution carers make.”</p><br /><p>The Care Act replicates the previous position where charging carers was permissible. It would not have been appropriate to impose a blanket ban on charging for carers services, because in some cases small charges are necessary to the viability of services. However, the Care Act provides additional protection to carers by making it clear that local authorities cannot charge carers for services provided to the person being cared for. This means that carers may only be charged for services provided directly to them.</p><br /><p>Most local authorities (currently only 5%) do not routinely charge carers in recognition of the valuable contribution carers make to their local communities, and the Carers Trust report confirms that this is still the case. We will continue to make the case against routine charging of carers and to monitor the situation closely.</p><p>The Care Act and guidance are clear about the provision of preventative services. Under the Care Act, local authorities have a responsibility to support carers in a number of ways. This includes duties on local authorities to provide information and advice and universal preventative services for carers.</p><br /><p>We continue to support implementation of the Care Act 2014.</p><br /><p>To support implementation of the reform programme, we have established a joint Programme Management Office between the Department, Local Government Association and Association of Directors of Adults Social Services (ADASS). This unprecedented partnership is driving collaborative working with the sector, influencing the local implementation of these changes to support a consistent and coherent approach. This approach was recognised by the National Audit Office as best practice and should be adopted by other programmes.</p><br /><p>The programme includes a series of stocktakes of local authority readiness and the latest, from June 2015, demonstrates an overall positive picture on implementation:</p><p>- Councils’ confidence in their ability to deliver the Care Act Reforms in 2015/16 remains high, with 99% very or fairly confident.</p><p>- 89% of councils say that they are ‘on track’ with their implementation. The remaining 11% report themselves as only slightly behind.</p><br /><p>The Department is also leading on the development of a new National Carers’ Strategy that will examine what more we can do to support existing carers and the new carers.</p>","North East Bedfordshire","Alistair Burt",,"2015-10-28T17:37:48.583Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423574/answer","Biography information for Alistair Burt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423574/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423574/answer",,,,,,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-10-23","Carers","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will make an assessment of the implications for his policies of the findings of the report, A Charge on Caring?, published by the Carers Trust in September 2015, on the level of compliance by councils with their duty under the Care Act 2014 to prevent carers developing a need for support.","false","Biography information for Barbara Keeley","Worsley and Eccles South","Barbara Keeley","13247"

The Task Force included input from representatives of the Sustainable Aviation group.</p><br /><p>The Task Force’s report was published in March 2015 by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership. The Task Force acknowledged that sustainable biofuels have a valuable role in reducing carbon emissions from transport, particularly in sectors where there are limited alternatives such as aviation and I met with Task Force representatives, including Sustainable Aviation, in July to discuss that report.</p><br /><p>Following the report of the Transport Energy Task Force, we are assessing the benefits of making aviation biofuels eligible for certificates under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and support under that scheme for synthetic fuels from renewable electricity. We aim to include proposals in a public consultation next year on potential amendments to the RTFO scheme.</p><br />","Harrogate and Knaresborough","Andrew Jones","13225 ; 13231","2015-11-02T11:52:03.737Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423615/answer","Biography information for Andrew Jones","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423615/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/423615/answer",,,,,,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2015-10-23","Aviation: Fuels","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what steps his Department has taken to promote the development of sustainable aviation fuels in the UK.","false","Biography information for Mark Tami","Alyn and Deeside","Mark Tami","13226"
