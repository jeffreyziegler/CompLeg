From year 9 onwards the four Preparation for Adulthood outcomes (employment, health, independent living and friends, relationships and community) must be included in the EHC plan annual review. A young person must not leave education without all four outcomes being carefully reviewed to support transition into adult life.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>The Government is funding specialist training for careers advisers working with young people who have special educational needs and disabilities. We are also funding training and materials for post-16 providers on curriculum design and delivery, including pathways to employment for these young people. The National Careers Service is delivering positive outcomes for people from all backgrounds and customers with a disability are included in the Service’s priority groups. In the past year the Service has seen over 90,000 customers with a disability or learning difficulty. In 2016-17 more than 20% of customers declared that they had a learning difficulty and/or disability (source: Ipsos MORI).</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>In 2016/17, over 500 young people took part in Supported Internships, which are aimed at those with EHC plans. On 30 November 2017, the Department for Education announced a further £9.7 million funding in 2017-18 to establish local supported internship forums, which will create work placements for young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). Access to Work can be used to fund support from a specialist job coach for individuals undertaking supported internships.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>The Department for Education (DfE) has set a measure of success for a 20% increase in the proportion of apprenticeship starts by people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities by 2020. To support this, it has introduced legislation to adjust the minimum English and maths requirements for apprenticeships for a defined group of people with a learning difficulty or disability to entry level 3.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>200 Community Partners are being recruited to Jobcentre Plus, to enhance the services Jobcentres provide to people with a disability or health condition. Community Partners have a lived experience or expert knowledge of disability and provide valuable insight into how disability can effect an individual’s employment outcomes, both in terms of securing and sustaining employment. Many of the Community Partners will have a specialism and 11 will be specialists in learning disabilities and neurodiverse conditions.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>A Local Supported Employment Proof of Concept is being delivered with 9 local authorities. DWP is investing £2.7 million to test an approach which delivers Supported Employment, on an outcome-payment basis, to help people with a learning disability or learning difficulties who are known to adult social care, or those in contact with secondary mental health services.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>On Thursday 30 November 2017 we published ‘Improving Lives the Future of Work, Health and Disability’, which sets out details of our lifecourse approach to improving employment opportunities for people with learning difficulties or learning disabilities.</li></ul>","Truro and Falmouth","Sarah Newton",,"2017-12-21T15:39:26.743Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/809059/answer","Biography information for Sarah Newton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/809059/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/809059/answer",,,,,"29","Work and Pensions","Work and Pensions","2017-12-18","Graduates: Learning Disability","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what measures are in place to provide support to students with learning difficulties after they leave full-time education.","false","Biography information for Nic Dakin","Scunthorpe","Nic Dakin","120168"

Individual projects and procurements have already been launched for replacement services with market sounding as a routine step in the procurement process e.g. the new End User Computing contract. Digital Partners have been selected through the G Cloud framework for development of replacement services with significant market interest shown when the procurement exercise was launched 12 months ago. DVSA ensures it understands User Needs through a Discovery phase e.g. in developing new digital MOT service which fully replaced the old MOT PFI contract. In addition, DVSA makes use of technology analysists to understand developments in the market.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>(b) setting up disaggregation work, </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Projects for replacement services to exit from the two existing major IT contracts are launched and have governance processes that requires scrutiny and approval of full business cases and have a SRO identified.</p><p>Agile methodology is used within these projects with MVP and service backlogs identified and routinely tracked through burn down charts for each sprint. Project benefits are tracked through internal governance and include enabling benefits the exit of existing contracts. E.g., the Commercial Vehicle Services (CVS) project will enable the exit of a majority of the DVSA IS2003 contract with Atos during its remaining term. All other activities to enable contract exit are managed on a Common Technology Service backlog.</p><p> </p><p><strong>(c) risk assessment, </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>DVSA has identified non exit within the remaining term of their two major IT contracts as a corporate risk and this is monitored by the DVSA Directing Board. Each project that facilitates contract exit is subject to normal project governance including monthly risk assessments. All contract end dates are routinely monitored through the DVSA Investment and Change Committee (ICC).</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>(d) developing a programme plan through the transition, </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Planning for contract exit and introduction of replacement services are managed through project plans and transition is part of the deliverable for the projects. For exit of the two major IT contracts, an internal DVSA Oversight Board has been established to monitor risks to exit timescales. This updates the DVSA Investment and Change Committee which is chaired by a Director.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>(e) identifying the skills and capabilities that will be needed in the future and </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The need for futures skills and capabilities was recognised in the 2015 DVSA Digital Services &amp; Technology strategy. DVSA has already successfully run an apprentice programme and a graduate programme for developing digital capability. In addition, recruitment campaigns are being run to fill permanent posts in the organisation consistent with the Digital, Data and Technology (DDAT) professional requirements. DVSA Digital Services and Technology Directorate has measured itself against Government Commercial Function operating standards.</p><p> </p><p><strong>(f) any other work related to that guidance.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Incumbent suppliers are being proactively managed by DVSA to secure their cooperation for exit and transition. Formal partnership meetings are held with senior executives and a collaborative approach has been established. This is reinforced through DVSA engagement with the relevant Crown Representatives and Strategic Relationship Mangers at Cabinet Office.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p>","South Holland and The Deepings","Mr John Hayes",,"2017-12-21T13:54:28.567Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/807213/answer","Biography information for Sir John Hayes","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/807213/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/807213/answer",,,,,"27","Transport","Transport","2017-12-15","Department for Transport: ICT","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Transport,  what steps his Department is taking to implement the guidance set out by the Government Commercial Function in its paper entitled Exiting Major IT Contracts: Guidance for Departments, published in November 2017, in respect of (a) using market engagement, (b) setting up disaggregation work, (c) risk assessment, (d) developing a programme plan through the transition, (e) identifying the skills and capabilities that will be needed in the future and (f) any other work related to that guidance.","false","Biography information for Jon Trickett","Hemsworth","Jon Trickett","119859"
