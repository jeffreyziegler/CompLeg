The Domestic Partnership Act passed in Bermuda in February 2018, removed the right to marry but replaced it with a provision for domestic partnerships with the same benefits as married couples. The Foreign Secretary has raised with the Premier of Bermuda his hope that the Domestic Partnership Act will be a stepping stone to putting same sex marriage on a statutory footing in the future.</p><p>The European Court of Human Rights has not, so far, interpreted the Convention to include a right to marry for same sex couples and has stopped short of finding a positive obligation generally to introduce protection equivalent to marriage. Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Montserrat and the Cayman Islands do not yet have in place legislation that provides for the recognition of same sex relationships whether by civil unions, civil partnerships or marriage. The new Governor of the Cayman Islands has publicly supported the introduction of civil unions and has urged the Premier and Leader of the Opposition to consider legislative change. There is a provision in the Cayman Islands' Constitution that provides that any person may apply to the Grand Court to determine compatibility with the Bill of Rights.</p><p>The European Convention on Human Rights applies to all the Overseas Territories. Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon raised the need to ensure that human rights obligations are upheld, in his meeting with the Premier of the Cayman Islands in October 2017, and with the Governments of all the Caribbean Overseas Territories at the Joint Ministerial Council in November 2017.

To support commissioners and clinicians to deliver evidence based local services for people with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published the best practice guidance, ‘Crohn’s Disease Management in Adults, Children and Young People’, in October 2012 (updated in 2016), and, ‘Ulcerative Colitis Management in Adults, Children and Young People’, in June 2013. Commissioners should have regard to NICE guidance when planning services for local populations.</p><p>The NICE Crohn’s clinical guideline states that “Inducing and maintaining remission as well as optimising nutritional status and growth, and minimising psychological concerns and possible side effects of treatment are fundamental to best practice for all people with Crohn's disease, whatever their age.” This could include access to psychological support if appropriate. The NICE Ulcerative Colitis clinical guideline states that “Access to psychologists and counsellors is important for a range of problems and people with ulcerative colitis may benefit from their input at various stages of the disease.” Psychological support is highlighted as being particularly important if a patient is considering surgery for their disease, and post-operatively, when surgery has taken place. Again, the guideline is clear that psychological support can play a part in patient care, if appropriate. Both sets of guidance can be found at the following links:</p><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg166" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg166 </a></p><p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg152" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg152</a></p><p>Where appropriate and in line with the best available evidence, NICE has also made recommendations on psychological support for other long term conditions in its clinical guidelines.
