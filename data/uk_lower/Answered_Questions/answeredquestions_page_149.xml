Devolution training can also be incorporated into broader training products.</p><p>The Home Office is also an active participant in the <em>Devolution and You</em> campaign. <em>Devolution and You</em> was established in 2015 following a Civil Service Board commission. The Board recognised the need for greater understanding of devolution among civil servants and for better intergovernmental working across the different administrations in the UK. The program is led by Cabinet Office in partnership with the Scottish and Welsh Governments.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896454","House of Commons Commission","false","2018-05-16","<p>In the last five years, the House of Commons has signed a number of settlement agreements with employees (formerly known as compromise agreements). In some cases, the House has reached agreements with individuals through ACAS, which are equivalent to settlement agreements but known as COT3 agreements. The majority of these have brought the employment contract to an end, although there have been a small number of in-employment settlements.</p><p>The figures inclusive of all of settlement and COT3 agreements for each of the last five years are:</p><ul><li>2017 – 8 agreements</li><li>2016 – 15 agreements</li><li>2015 – 5 agreements</li><li>2014 – 14 agreements</li><li>2013 – 11 agreements</li></ul><p><br>Confidentiality clauses are included in all or almost all of these agreements. Confidentiality clauses are intended to protect both the employer and the employee, as well as to ensure that the content of the settlement agreement itself is not discussed (so, for example, neither side will reveal how much, if any, money was paid under the agreement). An agreement will often include an agreed reference or public statement from the employer about the employee, and the confidentiality agreement will state that the only comment made by either party will be in the specified form.</p><p>Since January 2015 such clauses have no longer been included as a matter of course. Each case is considered on its merits. Reasons for including a confidentiality clause can include: supporting an individual to leave in a dignified manner; not publicly undermining managers who have been involved in the case; and discouraging similar future claims.</p><p>The House’s approach to confidentiality clauses follows the 2015 Cabinet Office Guidance on Settlement Agreements, Special Severance Payments and Confidentiality Clauses on Termination of Employment. They also follow this guidance with respect to protected disclosures (“whistleblowing”). Any provision in a settlement agreement which seeks to prevent protected disclosures is unenforceable, and since 2015 this has been made explicit with the following statement added to all agreements: “nothing in this Agreement is intended to prejudice the Employee’s rights related to protected disclosures”. All employees who sign settlement agreements receive advice on the contents of the agreement from an independent lawyer or an independent trade union official, for which the House pays.</p>","Carshalton and Wallington","Tom Brake",,"2018-05-16T09:37:04.917Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896454/answer","Biography information for Tom Brake","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896454/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896454/answer",,,,,"18","House of Commons Commission","House of Commons Commission","2018-05-02","House of Commons Commission: Disclosure of Information","1","House of Commons","To ask the right hon.

In our Industrial Strategy we have set out four Grand Challenges where Britain can lead the global technological revolution: in artificial intelligence and the data revolution; the global shift to clean growth; the ageing society; and the future of mobility – where we will build on our strengths to shape new markets and enhance the UK’s competitive advantage.</p><p> </p><p>As we made clear in the Industrial Strategy White Paper, we will use all the policy levers at our disposal, including government procurement, to achieve success in the Grand Challenges. We will drive innovation not only by supporting research and development, but also through the creation and shaping of new markets. Where appropriate, we will look to take a mission-oriented approach to guide these efforts, bringing industry, researchers and government together to solve practical problems and accelerate innovation.</p>","East Surrey","Mr Sam Gyimah",,"2018-05-09T11:50:56.907Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896524/answer","Biography information for Mr Sam Gyimah","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896524/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/896524/answer",,,,,"201","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","2018-05-02","Industry: Innovation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, with reference to the report, Mission-Oriented Research & Innovation: A problem-solving approach to fuel innovation-led growth, published by the European Commission on 22 February 2018, whether he plans to adopt a mission-based procurement approach as recommended in that report as part of the Government's Industrial Strategy.","false","Biography information for Alex Cunningham","Stockton North","Alex Cunningham","140716"
