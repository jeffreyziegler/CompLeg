We are on target to deliver an extra 250,000 work experience or sector-based work academy places by March 2015.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/164499","Department of Health","true","2014-12-04","<p>As at 31 March 2014, the National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHS LA) estimates that it has potential liabilities of £26.1 billion, of which £25.7 billion relates to clinical negligence. This is an increase of £3.1 billion from 31 March 201<del class="ministerial">4<ins class="ministerial">3</ins></del>, which can mainly be attributed to a continual rise in clinical negligence claims over recent years. There are a number of factors driving this increase, including the rise in the number of patients cared for and in the complexity of their care; and the general rise in litigation across a number of sectors including the NHS, driven in part by ‘no win, no fee’ agreements. It is anticipated that the effect of the latter is likely to diminish as a result of the Government’s Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act of 2012.</p><p> </p><p>The Department believes the best way to reduce negligence claims is to improve patient care and safety. In March 2014, the Secretary of State for Health issued a call to action to make the NHS the safest healthcare system in the world and achieve a three-year goal to halve avoidable harm and save 6,000 lives. The Sign up to Safety campaign embodies the ambition of the NHS to build a culture of safety, bringing together individuals and organisations with a contribution to make towards the patient safety goal. Elements of this campaign will focus on a reduction in avoidable harm that can lead to compensation claims. Organisations that sign up are setting out what they will do to strengthen patient safety, including a safety improvement plan which shows how their organisation intends to save lives and reduce harm for patients over the next three years. The NHS Litigation Authority, which already provides a “safety and learning service” to trusts<strong>,</strong> will support those organisations which have patient safety improvement plans that show a likely reduction in their higher volume, higher value claims.</p><p> </p>",,"Earl Howe",,"2014-12-04T16:04:05.87Z","2015-01-13T14:37:59.487Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/164499/answer","Biography information for Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/164499/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/164499/answer",,"Earl Howe","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/164499/answer/previousversion/31769","Biography information for Earl Howe","17","Health","Health","2014-11-24","NHS: Negligence","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty’s Government by how much the provision for clinical negligence claims against the National Health Service has grown in the last year; why it has grown; and what strategy is in place for reducing that amount.","false","Biography information for Lord Sharkey",,"Lord Sharkey","HL3092"

That is why this year the Government made significant reforms to the Extradition Act 2003 in the Anti-social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 to ensure that a UK judge must consider whether the alleged conduct and likely sentence a person will receive if extradited and convicted is sufficiently serious to make the person’s extradition proportionate. This is complemented by an administrative proportionality check, undertaken by the National Crime Agency (NCA), which identifies the most trivial requests when they are first received and refuses to certify them.</p><p>Since the measures were commenced on 21 July 2014, 21 Arrest Warrants have been refused by the NCA on proportionality grounds.</p><p>These changes are all designed to ensure that UK citizens benefit from adequate protections whilst allowing our police and prosecutors to benefit from the Arrest Warrant in the fight against crime.</p><p>It should also be noted that the Second Generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) requires Member States to consider the question of proportionality before uploading an Arrest Warrant to that system for transmission. Therefore, when the UK connects to SIS II there will be a legal requirement on all other Member States operating SIS II to consider proportionality before transmitting an Arrest Warrant to the UK. The Government expects to connect to SIS II in the coming months.</p><p>The Government also agrees with FTI that, in general, where an executing authority has refused an Arrest Warrant the issuing authority should withdraw the Arrest Warrant if it has also been sent to other Member States. SIS II will allow refused Arrest Warrants to be ‘flagged’ on this system, notifying other Member States that a case has been refused. Thus, if a UK court refuses an Arrest Warrant all other Member States using SIS II will be made aware of this fact.</p><p>The Government also agrees with FTI that the executing States should seek from issuing States further information and guarantees, before deciding whether to execute Arrest Warrants in cases where evidence has been adduced of a serious risk of infringement of fundamental rights. UK courts can and do seek such guarantees (e.g. assurances as to prison conditions).</p><p>The Government also agrees with FTI that those subject to Arrest Warrants should receive legal representation in the executing State, if they so wish. Where the individual concerned seeks legal advice and representation for proceedings in the issuing State, any application should be made in accordance with the rules governing the provision of such services in the issuing State.</p><p>On 6 October 2014, new EU Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourová, said, &quot;re-opening the [Arrest Warrant] at this point in time could be counter-productive, given</p><p>the divergent views which could be expressed in the Council.

Friend, the Secretary of State for Education has confirmed that she wants to see improvements to the quality of careers advice and guidance available to young people. We have issued revised statutory guidance for schools, which strengthens the requirement to build links with employers to inspire and mentor students. Schools are free to determine the most appropriate forms of engagement but might consider mentoring, workplace visits, work experience and employer talks. This will be particularly helpful in addressing stereotypes about specific career paths and providing young people with inspirational role models in a range of careers.</p><p>We have made significant progress in attracting more students to study science and maths at A level. Compared to 2010, we now have a thousand more girls studying physics every year and two thousand more girls studying maths. Our most recent A level results show that for the first time maths is now the most popular A level subject. The proportion of students entering A levels in biology, chemistry and physics has all increased too.</p><p>However, we need to go further. The Government has reformed the national curriculum and qualifications, to ensure that they enable young people to acquire the necessary knowledge and understanding to progress to further study and employment; we are recruiting top graduates into teaching by providing bursaries and scholarships in mathematics and the sciences of up to £25,000; and we are supporting schools through professional development and enrichment programmes, such as the Stimulating Physics Network and the establishment of 32 Maths Hubs.</p><p>The Government is also supporting Your Life, a three-year industry-led campaign, to ensure the UK has the maths and science skills it needs to succeed in a competitive global economy. The Your Life campaign will help to inspire young people to study A level maths and physics as a gateway to exciting and wide-ranging careers, and help employers recruit and retain talent, particularly women.</p><p> </p>","Grantham and Stamford","Nick Boles",,"2014-11-27T17:35:43.967Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156960/answer","Biography information for Nick Boles","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156960/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/156960/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2014-11-20","Employment: Females","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps her Department is taking to encourage increased female representation in (a) science and technology and (b) other traditionally male-dominated sectors; and if she will make a statement.","false","Biography information for Ms Diane Abbott","Hackney North and Stoke Newington","Ms Diane Abbott","215369"

Further information is available from: <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1616" target="_blank">http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1616</a>.</p><p> </p><p>To support the creation of more high quality part-time jobs, we are working to encourage cultural change in flexible working, especially to encourage employers to think about flexible working when they recruit new employees. For example, the Government convened an employer-led group to make practical recommendations on how flexible working can be beneficial and how it can be built into employer’s recruitment. Following the recommendations of this group we are encouraging the use of the strapline “Happy to Talk Flexible Working” by employers when they advert jobs.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, on 10 June, my Rt. Hon. Friend the Minister of State for Pensions and my Hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central (Jenny Willott) led a conference on flexible working for employers. The conference explained the benefits of flexible working and providing practical tips on getting it working within individual workplaces, including a practical session on successfully designing part-time jobs.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, to promote part-time work more generally, BIS, in partnership with the <strong>Business is Great</strong> campaign,<strong> the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) </strong>and<strong> PwC</strong>, sponsored a new initiative launched by Timewise in search of the UK’s most flexible small businesses that offer flexible work options to employees. The competition ran from 16 October to 24 November. The winner will be announced publicly by Friday 20 March 2015. The Government is also promoting flexible working and part-time working as part of the GREAT campaign to target business press. More detail on the GREAT campaign here: <a href="http://www.greatbusiness.gov.uk/flexibleworking/" target="_blank">http://www.greatbusiness.gov.uk/flexibleworking/</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Acas have produced guidance booklets for employers and employees on how to manage flexible working and a work-life balance.
