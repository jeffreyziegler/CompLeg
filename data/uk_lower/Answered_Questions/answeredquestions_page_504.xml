Ofcom expects that this level of indoor coverage will result in approximately 99 per cent outdoor coverage. As a result of the competitive UK telecoms market, all four of the UK mobile network operators have publicly committed to provide this level of coverage by the end of 2015.</p><p> </p><p>There is also likely to be further improvement in 2G and 3G coverage as a result of increasing roll out of combined 2G/3G/4G equipment by the industry.</p><p>However, sometimes it is not commercially viable for operators to install and operate base stations and associated infrastructure in areas of very low population. On 3 October 2011, the Government announced the Mobile Infrastructure Project (MIP) with up to £150 million funding to extend mobile phone coverage to remote and rural area across the country that currently receive no coverage from any network. The scheme sees Government provide the capital funding for Arqiva as contractors to build the new infrastructure.

These are therefore qualitative rather than quantitative. This feedback is collected and acted on at a local level rather than a national one. Complaints are monitored at a national level but addressed at the local level.</p><p> </p><p>Cafcass does not provide a return to the UK Statistics Authority; however they have published anonymised comments from feedback forms as part of their Annual Reports to draw out their direct work with children.</p><p> </p><p>Cafcass commissioned the Family Justice Young People's Board to review the means by which Cafcass encourages feedback from the children and young people it works with.

The launch in October 2013 of the Burmese government's National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (NSPAW) committed Burma “to develop and strengthen laws, systems, structures and practices to eliminate all forms of Violence Against Women and Girls and to respond to the needs of women and girls affected by violence”.</p><p>We are clear, however, that all of these steps need to be accompanied by actions leading to real progress in Burma.

We regularly lobby the Burmese government on the rights of women, particularly on preventing sexual violence in conflict areas. We continue to make clear that where serious crimes have been committed, those who have perpetrated them should be held accountable for their actions.

Are they responsive? Are they well-led? Restraint will be reviewed in services against the question of whether the service is safe and the CQC is developing guidance for both providers and inspection teams that will draw upon good practice guidance and tools. For children's psychiatric services specifically, this would require specific key lines of enquiry to be used.</p><p> </p><p>The CQC is planning to work with NHS Confederation to look at how the CQC expects providers to implement the guidance as set out in <em>Positive and Safe</em> and how this will be used in our monitoring and oversight approaches. <em>Positive and Safe</em> is a two year programme with the principal aim to radically reduce all restrictive interventions, including ending the deliberate use of face down restraint and – outside the Mental Health Act – seclusion. The work group will be preparing guidance on restraint in the light of <em>Positive and Safe</em> and using this to inform CQC tools and inspection methodology. The CQC always considers providers' approaches to restraint when carrying out comprehensive inspections. Mental Health Act monitoring visits to inpatient units will also look at individual concerns relating to restraint practices. The methodology for all reviews and inspections which the CQC carries out is informed by the available guidance and the Mental Health Act Code of Practice.</p><p> </p>","North Norfolk","Norman Lamb",,"2014-05-06T12:00:00.00Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/48549/answer","Biography information for Norman Lamb","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/48549/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/48549/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2014-04-25",,"1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what systems and controls are in place for recording, monitoring and oversight of the use of force and restraint against children receiving psychiatric in-patient care.","false","Biography information for Seema Malhotra","Feltham and Heston","Seema Malhotra","196782"

NHS England is leading this work, which also involves the MHRA, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the relevant professional societies (the British Society of Urogynaecology and the British Association of Urological Surgeons).</p><p> </p><p>Finished Consultant Episodes for women who have received a primary or secondary operative procedure for the insertion of Transvaginal Mesh, Transobturator Tape, Transvaginal Slings and Transvaginal Tape.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Procedure</p></td><td><p>2010-11</p></td><td><p>2011-12</p></td><td><p>2012-13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Insertion of Transvaginal Mesh</p></td><td><p>1,636</p></td><td><p>1,524</p></td><td><p>1,310</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Insertion of Transobturator Tape</p></td><td><p>5,426</p></td><td><p>4,885</p></td><td><p>4,476</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Insertion of Transvaginal Sling</p></td><td><p>130</p></td><td><p>134</p></td><td><p>135</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Insertion of Transvaginal Tape</p></td><td><p>8,087</p></td><td><p>8,172</p></td><td><p>7,627</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p><em>Source</em>: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Health and Social Care Information Centre.</p><p><em>Note</em>: Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Adverse events reported to MHRA by Health Professionals concerning Vaginal tape and mesh implants are as follows</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>Vaginal Tapes for Stress Urinary Incontinence</p></td><td><p>Vaginal Mesh for Pelvic Organ Prolapse</p></td><td><p>Vaginal Mesh for unknown* indication</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>23</p></td><td><p>31</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>27</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Up to March 2014</p></td><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>*The reporter did not provide enough information on what type of mesh it was</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Number of patient safety incidents relating to mesh used in gynaecological procedures reported to the NRLS (Year of occurrence by reported degree of harm)</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p>No Harm</p></td><td><p>Low</p></td><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td><p>TOTAL</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TOTAL</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>26</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Search strategy: All incidents from gynaecological specialties in the NRLS were searched on 2 December 2013 for the keyword ‘mesh'</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Adverse events reported to MHRA by patients/members of the public concerning Vaginal tape and mesh implants are as follows</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>Vaginal Tapes for Stress Urinary Incontinence</p></td><td><p>Vaginal Mesh for Pelvic Organ Prolapse</p></td><td><p>Vaginal Mesh for unknown* indication</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>33</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>26</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Up to March 2014</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>*The reporter did not provide enough information on what type of mesh it was</p><p> </p><p>No incidents relating to transvaginal mesh have been reported to the NRLS by patients.</p><p> </p><p>The Department has answered 11 previous Parliamentary Questions, 27 letters from hon.
