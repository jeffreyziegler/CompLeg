Many social landlords still expect their tenants to pay rent on a weekly basis, a practice based upon a time when both wages and benefits were paid weekly. The effect of this is that, roughly every six years, there will be 53 payment days in a twelve-month period with the result that, over the cycle, the average social sector tenant will receive approximately 35p a week less towards their rent.

The Government is committed to addressing the digital divide between those who have been able to embrace the digital world and those who have not.</p><p>We recently published our plans to improve adult basic digital skills by updating the national standards setting out the digital skills people need to get on in life and work and by introducing improved basic digital skills qualifications at two levels:</p><ul><li>‘beginner’ designed for adults with little or no prior experience of using digital devices or the internet</li><li>‘essential’ designed for adults with some experience of using digital devices and the internet but lacking the full range of basic digital skills needed for life and work.</li></ul><p>We will be introducing a national entitlement to basic digital skills courses from 2020, similar to the existing legal entitlements for English and Maths.</p><p>DCMS launched an innovation fund in September specifically targeting the digital inclusion of disabled and older people, with a further focus on those in rural areas, and on using digital to tackle loneliness. The aim of the fund is to help ensure that ‘what works’ on digital inclusion is identified, replicated and scaled. We have also commissioned a feasibility study to look at whether outcomes based commissioning models, including Social Impact Bonds, could be used to improve outcomes, particularly for those groups that are most likely to be digitally excluded.</p><p>Government is also tackling digital exclusion via the ‘Future Digital Inclusion’ programme funded by DfE and managed by the Good Things Foundation and delivered through the 3,000 strong Online Centres network. To date, this programme has supported over 800,000 adult learners to develop their basic digital skills, many of whom are socially excluded. Further, the NHS Digital ‘Widening Digital Participation’ programme develops projects that enable people in England to improve their digital health skills and to increase their access to digital services and tools that support their health and care.</p>","Stourbridge","Margot James",,"2018-11-28T19:43:27.9Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1013164/answer","Biography information for Margot James","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1013164/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1013164/answer",,,,,,,,"10","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","2018-11-23","Digital Technology","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, what targets he has set for digital inclusion and whether he plans to update the Government Digital Inclusion Strategy 2014.","false","Biography information for Chi Onwurah","Newcastle upon Tyne Central","Chi Onwurah","195077"

However, In March 2016, the UN Secretary-General established the UN’s Trust Fund in Support of Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, to provide greater support to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN and related personnel. We are studying this Fund’s effectiveness and whether it provides adequate support for victims of sexual violence before taking a decision on whether to contribute. The UK is committed to ending sexual exploitation and abuse by those who are entrusted with protecting some of the most vulnerable people in the world. That is why we have committed around $3m to supporting the UN’s work on this issue since 2016, and wholeheartedly support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to tackle this issue robustly.
