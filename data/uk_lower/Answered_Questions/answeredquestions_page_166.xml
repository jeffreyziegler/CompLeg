As a result, in December 2016, NICE published End of Life Care for Infants, Children and Young People: Planning and Management, to support local services in the delivery of high quality end of life care particular to the needs of this group of patients, and their families. The guidance covers the planning and management of end of life and palliative care for infants, children and young people with life-limiting conditions.

In January 2018 the CQC subsequently published its report, “Mental Health Act – The rise in the use of the MHA to detain people in England”. The CQC’s programme was prompted by suggestions that the changing rates of detention under the Act have a number of causes and that these vary in different parts of the country. This is consistent with recent academic findings. Building on the CQC’s findings, the Government will work with arm’s length bodies and Professor Sir Simon Wessely’s independent review of the Act to explore further the factors involved. The review will publish an interim report in the spring highlighting priorities for further investigation, and will make recommendations to the Government later in the year.</p><p> </p><p>NHS England intends to publish a response to the Crisp Commission on Adult Acute Psychiatric Care shortly. The Commission’s report emphasises the need to focus on whole system capacity management and alternatives to admission, such as home treatment. NHS England and NHS Improvement’s major programme to support areas to eliminate non-specialist acute out-of-area placements for adults by 2020/21 will build on this, supported by £400 million investment in Crisis Resolution Home Treatment teams by 2020/21.</p>","Thurrock","Jackie Doyle-Price",,"2018-03-12T15:09:58.79Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/856922/answer","Biography information for Jackie Doyle-Price","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/856922/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/856922/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-03-07","Mental Health Services","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps he is taking to ensure that mental health services use the least restrictive options for care.","false","Biography information for Luciana Berger","Liverpool, Wavertree","Luciana Berger","131434"

When allocating prisoners to suitable establishments closeness to home is one of a number of factors considered.
