The government will be publishing a Life Chances strategy in the spring which will set out a comprehensive plan to fight disadvantage and extend opportunity, including policies to give children the best start in life.</p><p>The government is already implementing a range of policies which recognise the contribution of the first 1001 days of a child’s life to its subsequent academic and other attainment, which are detailed below.</p><p> </p><p>Healthy Child Programme</p><p>The evidence based Healthy Child Programme is the universal service offered to every family. Delivered by health visitors, the programme centres on a series of screening tests, immunisations, developmental reviews, and information and guidance to support families of children aged 0-5 years. Since October 2015 there have been five mandated child development reviews, to provide a national standard format to ensure universal coverage and ongoing improvements in public health. Effective implementation of the Healthy Child Programme should lead to readiness for school and improved learning.</p><p> </p><p>Best Start in Life programme</p><p>One of Public Health England’s (PHE) national priorities is to ensure that every child has the best start in life, so that they are ready to learn at age two and ready for school at five. The Best Start in Life programme provides national leadership to support local areas to take a whole system approach to commission and provide evidence based services and interventions which improve child health outcomes and reduce inequalities. PHE also has has also published a range of professional guidance for best practice to support families in the first 1001 days.</p><p> </p><p>Integrated Review (IR)</p><p>In 2013, DfE ran a joint Integrated Review pilot with the Department of Health (DH) which focused on two-year-olds in registered childcare settings. This was to test out the most effective way of undertaking the early years progress check with the universal DH Healthy Child Programme and providing parents with a holistic review of their child’s development. In 2015, we provided funding to support the roll out of the IR by all local authorities in England. We are currently piloting the second phase of the IR with eight local authority pilot areas to test different local models of how early years practitioners can collaborate with health professionals to identify parents of two year-olds not in registered childcare settings, so that their children can also benefit from an Integrated Review.</p><p> </p><p>Early Learning for Two Year Olds</p><p>There is a strong body of evidence that shows good quality childcare and pre-school provision, especially from age two and upwards, has positive benefits on children’s all round attainment and behaviour. For this reason the government introduced the early learning for two-year-olds programme in September 2013 for 130,000 of the most disadvantaged children in England. In September 2014, the programme was later expanded to 260,000 of the most disadvantaged children in England.

That resolution still stands. At that time, the change was not agreed by the House of Commons.</p><p>In the past six years (2009/10 to 2014/15) the Lords has spent a total of £620,440 on vellum Acts; an average of just over £103,000 per year.</p><p>This is despite the availability of archival paper which is of extremely high quality and durability.</p><p>Private Acts of Parliament have been printed on archival quality paper since 1956, and I am not aware that vellum is now used for any other UK governmental or parliamentary records.</p><p>The National Archives has confirmed the view it took in 1999: that it does not require a vellum copy, and that archival quality paper is sufficient to maintain the public record. It also maintains a comprehensive database of legislation, both “as originally enacted” and “as amended”, on <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.legislation.gov.uk</a>.</p><p>Switching from vellum to high quality archival paper would, on a conservative estimate, save approximately 80% on current costs - or around £80,000 per year. The exact level of savings to public funds will depend on the number of Acts passed, and number of pages per Act, per year, and the precise specification and contractual arrangements agreed for future printing.</p><p>As well as being an expensive raw material, vellum requires a highly specialised form of printing which is not widely available, the machinery for which is expensive to maintain, and which is likely to be more difficult to procure on the expiry of the House’s current printing contract in March 2016.</p><p>As the start of a new Parliament seemed a natural point at which to implement the change previously agreed by this House, and we were coming to the end of present contracts, the House Committee was content that we were seeking to take forward the House’s 1999 decision. I then wrote to the Chairman of the House of Commons Administration Committee to invite that House to agree to the change.

Ministers from the Department for Education, the Department for Culture Media and Sport, and the Home Office meet quarterly with social media providers and other key stakeholders at the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) executive board meetings, to discuss important issues relating to child safety online, including cyberbullying.</p><p>Recently, Ofcom led a social media working group on behalf of UKCCIS, with representation from Twitter, Facebook, Google, Ask.FM, and MindCandy. The group developed best practice guidance aimed at encouraging responsible practice from industry to ensure children using their services are able to do so in a safe and protected way. The guidance was issued by UKCISS in December 2015 and can be found on their website.</p><p>To help schools prevent and tackle bullying, we are providing £1.3m this year (2015-16) to anti-bullying charities to tackle all forms of bullying including cyberbullying, on top of the £4m provided in 2013-15. We are also providing £2m this year (2015-16) to organisations to specifically tackle homophobic bullying, which includes cyberbullying.</p><p>We do not want to make any form of bullying a criminal offence as to do so would risk criminalising young people. In some circumstances that may be justified, but probably only in a limited number of very serious cases, for which there are already laws in place to protect people. Internet providers, schools and parents all have a role to play in keeping children and young people safe online.</p><p>The Government Equalities Office is funding the UK Safer Internet Centre to produce advice for schools on how to keep children safe online. This is scheduled for publication this spring.</p>","Crewe and Nantwich","Edward Timpson","27105 ; 27106","2016-02-23T11:08:21.537Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/452387/answer","Biography information for Edward Timpson","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/452387/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/452387/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2016-02-11","Internet: Bullying","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment she has made of the potential merits of criminalising cyber bullying.","false","Biography information for David Simpson","Upper Bann","David Simpson","27104"

Research participation in countries for which data exists has lagged behind the United Kingdom, at around 3% to 8% of cancer patients. For this reason, several other countries (including USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan) have sought advice from leaders in the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN) and adopted elements of the UK approach.</p><p> </p><p>Since 2012, the number of cancer research studies to which English patients have been recruited through the NIHR CRN has continued to rise year-on-year.

However, the nature of clinical research questions has changed, reducing the demand for very large numbers of patients per study. Consequently, despite the continuing increase in research studies, the total number of patients recruited per year fell slightly during 2012-14. However, there has been a 10% increase in recruitment to date in 2015-16 compared with the same months in 2014-15.</p><p> </p><p>As well as monitoring overall recruitment to cancer studies, the NIHR CRN is continually monitoring detailed performance including regional variation and variation between different cancer types, and taking steps to improve lower-performing areas.
