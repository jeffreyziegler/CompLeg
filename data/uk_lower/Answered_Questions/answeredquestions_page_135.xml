In making their local arrangements, the safeguarding partners should agree with other relevant agencies the levels for the different types of assessment and services to be commissioned and delivered – which could include outreach services. In implementing these new arrangements, my department is working closely with the DHSC, as well as the Home Office.</p><p>On 4 December 2017 the government published the 'Transforming children and young people’s mental health provision' green paper. It sets out our ambition to go further to ensure that children and young people showing early signs of distress are always able to access the right help, in the right setting, when they need it. There is clear evidence that schools and colleges can, and do, play a vital role in identifying mental health needs at an early stage, referring young people to specialist support and working jointly with others to support young people experiencing problems. We will fund new mental health support teams to provide specific extra capacity for early intervention and ongoing help, supervised by NHS children and young people’s mental health staff, whose work will be jointly managed by schools and the NHS.</p><p>My department is also working with Public Health England (an executive agency of DHSC) to help fulfil its ambition in 'Unlocking Talent, Fulfilling Potential', published in December 2017, to close the word gap in the early years.

NHS England allocates funding to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The model for CCG allocations is made up of three separate formulas – CCG core allocations, primary care and specialised services. Each formula is made up of a number of segments (for example, services covered by CCG core allocations include the segments maternity, mental health, prescribing, general and acute and supply needs). Each segment may be affected by the local population’s attributes, for example sex, age, morbidity, rates of disability, excess deaths and deprivation, plus wider factors associated with health needs including housing status and unemployment.</p><p>The statistical allocations formula is built up from data, which the NHS holds on individuals and their use of hospital services. This person-based approach helps ensure accuracy and takes account of local variation in health needs. Data for patients in general practitioner (GP) practices are linked to their treatment records, to calculate overall cost of care. The costs of health services for millions of real patients over a number of years are reviewed. Statistical analysis identifies factors, which can be used to predict future spending, for a given sex-age group in any GP practice in England (all data used is non-identifiable).
