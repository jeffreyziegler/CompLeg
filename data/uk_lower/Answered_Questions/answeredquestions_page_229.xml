DLA and PIP are tax free allowances, which are designed to contribute to the extra costs incurred as a result of long-term health conditions and/or disabilities. Children and young people in receipt of DLA or PIP can receive up to £141.10 a week. Entitlement to DLA and PIP depends on the effects that severe disability has on a person’s life and not on a particular disability or diagnosis. This is because people living with the same illnesses or disabilities may not necessarily have the same care or mobility needs.</p><p> </p><p>Special considerations do however apply to children and adults who are terminally ill, and our arrangements recognise the particular difficulties faced by people who have only a short time to live. Their claims are fast-tracked and they are awarded the highest rate of the care component of DLA and the enhanced rate of the daily living component of PIP automatically without having to complete a qualifying period. This means that, if they claim straight away, they can get benefit as soon as they have been diagnosed as being terminally ill. The arrangements ensure that claims are dealt with quickly and sensitively. The legislation defines a person as terminally ill if ‘he suffers from a progressive disease and his death can reasonably be expected within six months’.</p><p> </p><p>People over the age of 16 who are unable to work due to an illness or disability can claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) which has both a contributory strand accessible via a National Insurance contribution test and an income-related strand accessible via an income test.

Since then, police forces have received broadly flat cash direct resource funding and we are increasing investment in transformation and improved communications and technology capabilities. As a result, Merseyside police force received £500,000 more in 2017/18 compared with 2015/16. However, the Government recognises that the police have faced significant challenges this year. We have, therefore, set in hand a programme of engagement to understand better the demands they face, and how these can best be managed. As part of this, the Minister for Policing and Fire Minister will be speaking to, and visiting, a number of forces over the next few months.</p><p> </p><p>We are in regular discussion with police forces and the National Ballistics Intelligence Service to monitor gun crime levels. The ONS statistics show that firearms offences are 34% lower than they were a decade ago, though there has been an increase nationally in recent years. The opposite has been the case in Merseyside in recent years, with firearms offences falling. However, we know incidents where a firearm has been discharged have increased over the last year in Merseyside.</p><p> </p><p>We continue to work closely with law enforcement partners to ensure that we have the right intelligence, detection and enforcement capabilities internationally, at the UK border and within the UK. For example, firearms controls have been strengthened through the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and a multi-agency firearms unit has been established. On 5<sup>th</sup> September this unit was awarded £2.4m of Police Transformation Funding. We are also introducing statutory guidance for the police on firearms licensing to ensure that the robust processes in place for assessing an individual’s suitability to own a gun are applied consistently. Last year we initiated a new firearms science and technology programme, committing £2m over two years, to the development of automatic threat detection technology.</p><p> </p><p>Complementary to this work at the national level, the Home Office supports the local and regional response to crime where appropriate, and discussions are ongoing about the support available for Merseyside.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758777","Home Office","false","2017-09-13","<p>The UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world and an excellent record on enforcement. As a result firearm offences make up a small proportion of overall recorded crime.</p><p> </p><p>We are in regular discussion with police forces and the National Ballistics Intelligence Service to monitor gun crime levels. The ONS statistics show that firearms offences are 34% lower than they were a decade ago, though there has been an increase nationally in recent years. The opposite has been the case in Merseyside in recent years, with firearms offences falling. However, we know incidents where a firearm has been discharged have increased over the last year in Merseyside.</p><p> </p><p>We continue to work closely with law enforcement partners to ensure that we have the right intelligence, detection and enforcement capabilities internationally, at the UK border and within the UK. For example, firearms controls have been strengthened through the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and a multi-agency firearms unit has been established. On 5<sup>th</sup> September this unit was awarded £2.4m of Police Transformation Funding. We are also introducing statutory guidance for the police on firearms licensing to ensure that the robust processes in place for assessing an individual’s suitability to own a gun are applied consistently. Last year we initiated a new firearms science and technology programme, committing £2m over two years, to the development of automatic threat detection technology.</p><p> </p><p>The 2015 Spending Review protected police funding in real terms, assuming Police and Crime Commissioners maximise precept. Since then, police forces have received broadly flat cash direct resource funding and we are increasing investment in transformation and improved communications and technology capabilities. As a result, Merseyside police force received £500,000 more in 2017/18 compared with 2015/16. However, the Government recognises that the police have faced significant challenges this year. We have, therefore, set in hand a programme of engagement to understand better the demands they face, and how these can best be managed. As part of this, the Minister for Policing and Fire Minister will be visiting a number of forces, including Merseyside, over the next few months.</p>","Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner","Mr Nick Hurd",,"2017-09-13T15:15:31.33Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758777/answer","Biography information for Mr Nick Hurd","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758777/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758777/answer",,,,,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2017-09-07","Firearms: Crime","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment she has made of the trends in the level of gun crime in (a) Merseyside and (b) England and the implications of that assessment for any reform of police funding.","false","Biography information for Dan Carden","Liverpool, Walton","Dan Carden","9334"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758814","Ministry of Justice","false","2017-09-15","<p>In 2014/15 the government reformed the probation system to strengthen its focus on reducing reoffending and protecting communities. These reforms included dividing the probation caseload between Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) who supervise low and medium-risk offenders and the National Probation Service (NPS) who supervise higher-risk offenders.</p><p><br>Since these reforms there have been unforeseen falls in the number of offenders sentenced to community orders, and an increase in the proportion of offenders assessed as posing a higher risk of harm. The result has been fewer offenders being referred to CRCs, leading to falls in CRC income to levels below those expected at the time of competition. It is for this reason that we took action to adjust the payment mechanism in CRC contracts so that providers’ income better reflects the fixed costs of delivering services to offenders and is less sensitive to changes in demand. As previously confirmed, this additional investment will see projected payments to CRCs still being no higher than originally budgeted for at the time of the reforms.</p>","Bracknell","Dr Phillip Lee",,"2017-09-15T13:10:36.977Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758814/answer","Biography information for Dr Phillip Lee","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758814/answer",,,,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/758814/answer",,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2017-09-07","Probation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what factors led him to conclude in July 2017 that the problems experienced as a result of the reform of the probation service were unforeseen.","false","Biography information for Liz Saville Roberts","Dwyfor Meirionnydd","Liz Saville Roberts","9533"
