We are committed to being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it, and to eliminating avoidable plastic waste over the lifetime of the 25 Year Environment Plan.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is currently consulting on reforming existing packaging waste regulations to financially incentivise packaging producers, including those who package food products, to take greater responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products. Our plans for Extended Producer Responsibility include requiring producers to pay the full cost of recycling and disposing of their packaging waste and making producers pay more if their products are not easily recyclable. Current packaging waste regulations operate on a UK-wide basis. The benefits of continuing with a UK-wide approach are recognised and our consultation on reforming the regulations is being undertaken jointly by the UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments. As the Northern Ireland Assembly is not sitting, the UK Government has agreed to consult on behalf of Northern Ireland.</p><p> </p><p>Industry is already taking action. Last year, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation published their Plastics Pact with support from the Government and more than 80 businesses, including major food manufacturers such as Birds Eye, Quorn, and McCain Foods GB. The Pact brings these organisations together to aim to meet four key ambitions by 2025, including making 100% of plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable. The Government welcomes voluntary initiatives aimed at tackling plastic pollution and will continue to seek opportunities to support such work through policy solutions.</p><p> </p><p>Plastic packaging can have a role to play in reducing product damage, increasing shelf life and reducing food waste. However, there are opportunities where offering food loose may help to reduce plastic waste while not impacting on shelf life. The Government is working with retailers and WRAP to encourage their efforts to reduce waste and to explore the introduction of plastic free supermarket initiatives in which fresh food is sold loose, giving consumers more choice. WRAP has published a technical report on the evidence for providing fresh produce loose. This report will inform future published guidance.</p><p> </p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1077257/answer",,,,,,"2019-03-04T15:37:45.5Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1077257/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1077257/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-02-25","Food: Packaging","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps he is taking to encourage food manufacturers to reduce the use of plastic.","false","Biography information for David Simpson","Upper Bann","David Simpson","225469"

We are working closely with local government representatives and others to consider the drivers of local authorities’ costs, the resources available locally to fund services, and how we should account for these in a way that draws a more transparent and understandable link between local circumstances and resource allocations.</p><p>In December 2018 the Government published a consultation paper, which set out a proposed approach to assessing the relative needs of local authorities. Our analysis has shown that for many universal services, the number of people in each local authority area is the most important predictor of the costs that councils face in delivering those services. The consultation therefore proposes the introduction of a simple population-based Foundation Formula to account for many of the universal services that local authorities deliver, alongside several specific funding formulas for some of the largest and most complex service areas.</p><p>To understand whether including additional ‘cost drivers’, including deprivation, significantly improves the precision of the Foundation Formula, a comparison was made between the amount of variation in past expenditure that was explained by different combinations of cost drivers, to the total amount of variation in expenditure. The basis on which this comparison was made is set out in pages 19 to 21 of the consultation paper (link below). Whilst, in aggregate terms, deprivation was not shown to be a major cost driver for the services included in the Foundation Formula, to ensure that deprivation is appropriately accounted for in the relative needs assessment, deprivation, or a suitable proxy for deprivation, is taken into account in four of the service-specific formulas that were proposed.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-local-authorities-relative-needs-and-resources" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-local-authorities-relative-needs-and-resources</a>.</p>","Richmond (Yorks)","Rishi Sunak","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064682/answer",,,,,,"2019-02-26T17:38:29.58Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064682/answer","Biography information for Rishi Sunak","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064682/answer",,,,,"7","Housing, Communities and Local Government","Housing, Communities and Local Government","2019-02-21","Local Government Finance","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, pursuant to the oral contribution of 5 February 2019 of the Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Official Report column 289, how that 4 per cent figure relating  to deprivation was calculated.","false","Biography information for Mr Clive Betts","Sheffield South East","Mr Clive Betts","224297"

We have delivered mentoring circles in all 20 challenge areas which involve national employers offering specialised support to unemployed, ethnic minority jobseekers to help build their confidence and raise their aspirations. In January 2019, I announced that these mentoring circles will now be rolled out nationally from April 2019.</p><p> </p><p>We also know from the Race Disparity Audit that gender matters, even more so for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi group, where employment rates for females is less than half of White groups. To help overcome this barrier, in September we started trialling a programme with Pakistani and Bangladeshi women in Birmingham. The women participated in workshops to explore the benefits of becoming work ready and the financial incentives for their families in taking up paid employment.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064726","Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","false","2019-02-28","<p>There is a system of international rules on waste shipments. The UK is a Party to the United Nations Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. The Convention provides a global system for controlling the export of hazardous wastes and wastes collected from households. The requirements of the Basel Convention have been implemented in UK law by the EU Waste Shipment Regulations (Regulation (EC) 1013/2006) and the UK Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. The legislation requires that those involved in the shipment of waste take all necessary steps to ensure waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner throughout its shipment and during its recycling or recovery.</p><p> </p><p>In 2017 the Environment Agency (EA) inspected over 1,000 shipping containers and returned 367 of these to their site of loading. This stopped over 7,000 tonnes of waste not fit for export at ports, and they also prevented nearly 9,000 tonnes of waste from reaching ports.</p><p> </p><p>As part of the Producer Responsibility system for packaging, WEEE and batteries waste streams, the EA is informed annually about the overseas sites exporters intend to use. Companies exporting to non-EU and non-OECD countries are asked to provide evidence that each overseas re-processor is suitably permitted and operates to broadly equivalent standards. Follow up assessment by the EA may include discussions with the competent overseas authority and the other devolved agencies. A list of acceptable evidence to support broadly equivalent standards has been created from this process. The list is regularly reviewed and shared externally with operators to ensure a consistent approach. As a result of our assessment, 95 overseas sites were refused approval for 2018.</p><p> </p><p>The agency uses a wide range of sources of intelligence to create a risk profile of these exporters which feeds into our compliance monitoring programme of visits and desk top monitoring. In 2017, 3.9m Tonnes (around 40%) of the estimated 10m Tonnes of Green List waste exported from the UK was exported by accredited packaging exporters, and subject to these checks.</p><p> </p><p>We recognise we need to do more to eliminate improperly-handled exports of wastes. Firstly, we need to grow our domestic waste industry so that we can handle more of it at home, reducing exports as far as possible. Secondly, we need to ensure strict controls are in place so that the waste we do have to export is dealt with properly.</p><p> </p><p>As part of the recently published Resources and Waste Strategy, Defra has committed to reviewing the regulatory framework covering waste exports. This will review the quality of exports for recycling and ensure that exports of all wastes are recycled at sites operating to equivalent standards to those required in the UK. The review is scheduled to take place this year and will consider options for the mandatory submission of ‘Annex VII’ paperwork (details of the waste being exported and all parties involved in its shipment and recovery overseas) in advance of shipments taking place. The review will also look at any associated IT systems required and charges needed for compliance monitoring activity.</p><p> </p><p>Other measures that we are developing include improved provision for waste repatriation, and charging higher fees to improve compliance. These changes aim to ensure any waste we do send abroad is fit for recycling and that it is recycled to equivalent standards as required in the UK. This should create a more level playing field for domestic recyclers as well as reducing the chances of exported waste being mishandled.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Suffolk Coastal","Dr Thérèse Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064726/answer",,,,,,"2019-02-28T10:20:45.043Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064726/answer","Biography information for Dr Thérèse  Coffey","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1064726/answer",,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2019-02-21","Waste: Exports","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what estimate he has made of the number of waste exporters who have not demonstrated that the importer of their waste operates to human health and environmental protection standards that are broadly equivalent to the standards within the EU.","false","Biography information for Emma Dent Coad","Kensington","Emma Dent Coad","224374"
