But as a responsible Government we have to consider all eventualities, and are working to ensure that, should no deal be achieved, additional UK customs checks do not take place at the frontier, and so do not result in disruption to surrounding transport infrastructure. The possibility, that checks required by the EU in Member States might have such an effect, is being considered where appropriate by Local Resilience Fora (LRFs), with the ports themselves closely involved; and by the Devolved Administrations in relation to ports in their territories.</p><p>Specifically in relation to the short Strait crossings from Dover and through the Channel Tunnel, we announced in May the development of Operation Brock which, in the event of serious disruption to those routes from whatever cause, will ensure that the M20 will be kept open and traffic will continue to flow in both directions. Operation Brock consists of three phases, a contraflow queuing system on the M20, a holding areas at Manston Airport and, if necessary, a holding area on the M26. The Department is working closely with the Kent Resilience Form, the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel and other associated bodies. The contraflow queuing system on the M20 will cost about £30 million to build and operate and would be used for all disruption events including those seen in 2015.

The rate of self-inflicted deaths in prison in the year to September 2018 was 1.0 per 1,000 prisoners: up from 0.9 per 1,000 in the previous 12 months, but below the rate in each of the three years before that. The Government takes very seriously its responsibility to keep staff and prisoners safe, and we are committed to reducing the incidence of self-harm and suicide across the estate. This is why we have established a prison safety programme through which we are taking forward a comprehensive set of actions to improve safety in custody. They include:<ul><li>investing in over 3,000 additional staff in order to deliver consistent, purposeful regimes;</li><li>introducing the new key worker role, under which staff can give prisoners more effective support;</li><li>rolling out revised and improved training for staff in assessing and managing the risk of suicide and self-harm amongst prisoners (this has already reached more than 17,000 staff);</li><li>improving support for prisoners in their early days in custody;</li><li>revising the ACCT case management process for those identified as being at risk; and</li><li>renewing our partnership with the Samaritans by confirming a further three years' grant funding for their valuable Listeners Scheme.</li></ul>We want to see prison numbers come down, but not by setting an arbitrary figure for reduction. Custody should achieve justice, by holding offenders whose crime is so serious that no other penalty will do, or who would pose a danger to the public if released. It must also rehabilitate those prisoners, because society is entitled to expect them to make a fresh start when they get out. We are determined to do better by offenders who are sent to prison, to make them less likely to return. There is persuasive evidence that short custodial sentences do not achieve that, and that community sentences can be more effective at reducing re-offending. We will therefore look at what more we can do to emphasise that short custodial sentences should be viewed as a last resort.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",,"Lord Keen of Elie",,"2018-11-08T16:42:10.863Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994726/answer","Biography information for Lord Keen of Elie","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994726/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994726/answer",,,,,,,,"54","Justice","Justice","2018-10-25","Offenders: Suicide","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of suicide rates among offenders on licence and in prisons; what assessment they have made of whether the number of offenders in the prison system contributes to those suicide rates; and whether they have plans to reduce the number of offenders in the prison system.","false","Biography information for Lord Patel of Bradford",,"Lord Patel of Bradford","HL11042"

We have been clear, however, that overall performance of CRCs needs to improve across a range of areas. We have taken decisive action to stabilise and improve the delivery of probation services, including by investing £22m per year to enhance ‘Through The Gate’ services and introducing minimum standards so that all providers offer monthly face-to-face meetings with offenders during their first 12 months of supervision. In September, we concluded a public consultation on proposals to end current CRC contracts early and introduce new arrangements for delivering probation services that will better integrate public, private and third sector probation providers and improve outcomes.

To help deliver this, we committed an ambitious package of up to £66.4m of UK Aid to drive research and innovation and stop plastic from entering into the oceans in the first place.

The vision included significant ambitions around increasing access to children and young people’s mental health services. Following publication, the Government committed £1.4 billion for improvements to children and young people’s mental health services over the following five years.</p><p> </p><p>Action is now underway to make a range of improvements to children and young people’s mental health services including increasing numbers accessing specialist services, new waiting time standards, setting up new support teams in or near schools, training staff to work in these, training teachers and piloting a waiting time for access to specialist services.</p><p> </p><p>The Government committed providing access to specialist mental health services for an additional 70,000 children and young people a year by 2020/21.This is being delivered through implementation of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health. This programme is at the half way point and available data suggests the Government is on track to deliver against this target.</p><p> </p><p>The Five Year Forward View also introduced two waiting time standards for children and young people. The first aims for 95% of children and young people (up to 19 years old) with eating disorders to receive treatment within a week for urgent cases and four weeks for routine cases by 2020/21. The second is that 50% of patients of all ages experiencing a first episode of psychosis should receive treatment within two weeks of referral by 2020/21. We are currently on track and meeting these waiting time standards respectively.</p><p> </p><p>In relation to the development of a ‘whole system approach’, the Government is going further than the vision set out in Future in Mind. Our Green Paper, published jointly with the Department for Education, sets out our plans for increased support for children and young people in schools. As part of implementing this, we are setting up new Mental Health Support Teams to deliver mental health interventions for those with mild to moderate needs in, or close to, schools and colleges (and refer those with more severe needs on to specialist services). Educational Mental Health practitioners’ training places are now open for 210 new staff. Training will start from January 2019.</p><p> </p><p>We will also ensure that at least one teacher in every primary and secondary school will receive mental health awareness training to enable school staff to spot common signs of mental health issues, and to help children and young people receive appropriate support.</p><p> </p><p>We have also committed to piloting a four week waiting time for access to specialist children and young people’s mental health services.</p>","West Suffolk","Matt Hancock",,"2018-10-29T14:10:52.7Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994297/answer","Biography information for Matt Hancock","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994297/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994297/answer",,,,,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-10-24","Mental Health Services: Children and Young People","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what (a) steps his Department is taking and (b) funding is allocated to implement each proposal in the Children and Young People's Mental Health Task Force report, Future in Mind; and what progress has been made on implementing those proposals to date.","false","Biography information for Luciana Berger","Liverpool, Wavertree","Luciana Berger","183516"

A quantitative risk assessment was carried out in 2011, which assessed the risk of a pet animal with rabies entering the UK under the EU Pet Travel Scheme (PTS) as very low. Defra continues to monitor the disease situation but has no plans to introduce a requirement for a rabies antibody titration test.</p><p> </p><p>For third countries with higher rabies risk, stricter rules do apply involving a rabies antibody titration test and waiting period. When the UK leaves the EU it will be a third country for the purposes of the EU Pet Travel Scheme (PTS).

For pet animals entering the UK from the EU we propose that we maintain the current pet travel entry health requirements after exit though additional controls could be considered at a later date. This would mean that the UK government is not introducing any new requirement immediately following EU exit. The notice advised that should the UK become an unlisted third country under PTS pet owners intending to travel with their pet from the UK to EU countries would need to prove animals are effectively vaccinated against rabies before they could travel with their pet to EU countries. This would require a blood titre test to demonstrate sufficient levels of rabies antibody. Once a blood titre test shows sufficient levels of antibody, there would need to be a three-month waiting period between the date the blood sample is taken and the date of travel.</p><p>Defra is working with a range of stakeholders to review the risks to animal health and welfare that illegal imports of dogs pose, and are considering a range of possible long-term measures to tackle these risks.</p>","Macclesfield","David Rutley",,"2018-11-05T10:05:17.707Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994302/answer","Biography information for David Rutley","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994302/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/994302/answer",,,,,,,,"13","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","2018-10-24","Rabies: Blood Tests","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what plans he has to bring forward proposals to reintroduce a requirement for a rabies blood test and wait period in order to regulate pet travel and commercial pet movements after the UK leaves the EU.","false","Biography information for Andrea Jenkyns","Morley and Outwood","Andrea Jenkyns","183521"
