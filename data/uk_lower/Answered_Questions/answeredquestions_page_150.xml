Accordingly, we have spent over £13 billion since 2011, almost £2.5 billion this year alone, through the pupil premium to provide schools with extra resources to overcome barriers to learning that children from disadvantaged backgrounds can face. This complements our work to raise standards through much-needed reform to school curriculum, assessment and accountability.

This includes moving to employer-designed apprenticeship standards and underpinning some of the reforms by statute - including ensuring all apprenticeships last a minimum of 12 months, with at least 20 per cent off-the job training.</p><p> </p><p>The apprenticeship levy, launched on 6 April 2017, is an important part of our reforms, making sure there is long-term investment in apprenticeship training. Employers have taken time to plan their training but there have been 1.3 million starts in England since 2015; and there were 71,600 starts on apprenticeship standards reported in the first half of 2017/18; significantly higher than the 7,500 reported at this time last year (2016/17). This represents 36.9 per cent of all starts reported in 2017/18, showing that employers are moving quickly to the new higher quality offer.</p><p> </p><p>We expect the reforms to apprenticeships to have a positive effect on the amount of overall training undertaken by apprentices. The 20 per cent off-the job training rule, the shift to standards with a longer average duration, and the drop off in starts in lower-quality frameworks are likely to mean that, on average, apprentices will get more training throughout their apprenticeship.</p>","Guildford","Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/894965/answer",,,,,,"2018-05-03T15:37:42.477Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/894965/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/894965/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2018-04-30","Apprentices: Taxation","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the apprenticeship levy in increasing the (a) number and (b) quality of apprenticeships in England since the implementation of that levy.","false","Biography information for Catherine McKinnell","Newcastle upon Tyne North","Catherine McKinnell","139482"

We have spent over £13 billion since 2011, almost £2.5 billion this year alone, through the pupil premium to provide schools with resources to overcome barriers to learning and introduced the early years pupil premium for disadvantaged three- and four-year olds. Since 2011, the attainment gap in England has narrowed by 10% at age 11 and 16. Over 15,000 pupils in Coventry are eligible for support and last year their schools received more than £18 million through the pupil premium. In the West Midlands over 258,000 attracted the pupil premium, bringing an additional £302 million to their schools.</p><p>We look to schools to use this extra funding effectively. We know from research that a personalised approach, drawing on well-evidenced strategies, generally produces good results. Studies by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the toolkit maintained by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) provide support to school leaders in their decision-making. Examples of effective practice have been highlighted through our national Pupil Premium Awards. The EEF, which was set up in 2011 through a £125 million government grant, also runs a national network of Research Schools that help other schools adopt effective, evidence-based approaches to improving disadvantaged pupils’ attainment. Shireland Collegiate Academy in Sandwell is the designated EEF Research School for the Midlands.</p><p>We know that gaps can open by age five, much earlier than 11 or 16, and that the early years has a key role to play in improving social mobility later in life. That is why in' Unlocking Talent, Fulfilling Potential', we set our ambition to close the word gap at age five, backed by over £100 million of investment. The evidence clearly points to the impact of early education on later outcomes, and that disadvantaged children stand to gain the most. That’s why we’ve invested over £2 billion since 2013 in the entitlement to 15 hours of free early education for disadvantaged two-year-olds, from which over half a million have benefitted. Nearly 5,000 of these children took up their place in Coventry, worth £3.4 million.</p><p>The gap in Coventry between the proportion of disadvantaged children achieving a good level of development at age five on the early years foundation stage profile and their wealthier peers continues to narrow, from 17 percentage points in 2013 to 10 percentage points in 2017.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/893056/answer",,,,,,"2018-05-04T13:52:51.54Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/893056/answer","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/893056/answer","Stratford-on-Avon","Nadhim Zahawi","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/893056/answer/previousversion/55704","Biography information for Nadhim Zahawi","60","Education","Education","2018-04-27","Schools: West Midlands","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps he is taking to close the deprivation attainment gap in (a) Coventry and (b) the West Midlands.","false","Biography information for Mr Jim Cunningham","Coventry South","Mr Jim Cunningham","138942"
