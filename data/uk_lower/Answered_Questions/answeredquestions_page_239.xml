However, there are significant caveats around the interpretation of these figures for transport spending.</p><p> </p><p>The CRA attempts to allocate expenditure on the basis of which region benefits from the spend, rather than where it is made. However, this can be challenging as expenditure in one part of the country may actually benefit a different area, and this is particularly a problem for spending on the motorway, trunk roads, and the railway. For example, whilst spending on a local hospital is likely to predominantly benefit those who live in that area, spending on a motorway or railway line will benefit not just those living nearby but also those travelling from and to other areas across the country. Whilst the Department does try to record rail funding across the regions based on which passengers benefit, allocations are inevitably fairly imprecise.</p><p> </p><p>In terms of the calculation of this regional spending on a per capita basis (i.e. per head of resident population), the calculation for London doesn’t account for the substantial number of daily commuters and visitors, both domestically and internationally, who will be using and benefitting from the roads and public transport networks but who aren’t London residents. In particular, as the main international gateway into the country, London will be the location for transport investments which look to serve passengers well beyond the local resident population.</p><p> </p><p>The above caveats should be taken into account when looking at the CRA figures for regional Government expenditure on transport. The figures for 2015-16 relating to locations (b), (c) and (d) from the above request are shown in the table below.

The length of an award is based on an individual’s circumstances and can vary from nine months to an on-going award with a light touch review at the ten year point. PIP recognises that for the most severely disabled claimants, the award review process could seem unnecessarily intrusive. Existing PIP claimants with the most severe, lifetime disabilities, whose functional ability has remained the same, are more likely to have their evidence reviewed by a DWP Decision-Maker and will not need to have another face-to-face assessment with a healthcare professional.</p><p> </p><p>We will continue to closely monitor developments across the health and disability landscape and engage with stakeholders to improve the service we provide.
