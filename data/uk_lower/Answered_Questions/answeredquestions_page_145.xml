In addition, the mobility factor in the national funding formula allocates funding to schools that have a high proportion of pupils joining the school mid-way through the academic year; this totals around £22 million in 2018-19. Where appropriate, schools can also draw on the funding they are allocated to improve the progress and attainment of pupils from financially disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>Refugee students in 16-19 education settings are considered eligible for funding by the Education and Skills Funding Agency.

Having the right workforce is fundamental to ensure this can happen and the Government acknowledges the challenge of meeting increased demand for care from community nurses</p><p>Work by the NHS Benchmarking Network found that 39% of district nursing clinical time is spent on wound care and so wound care is a key service within the remit of community health services. There are a number of activities currently taking place to address the issues around wound care including the National ‘Stop the Pressure’ programme by NHS Improvement and the Leading Change, Adding Value: Improving Wound Care Project by NHS England.</p><p>District nurses will have completed a Specialist Practitioner Programme, approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, to practice. NHS Digital’s data shows a drop in the number of full-time equivalent practicing district nurses. This has been reported by various interested parties, including the King’s Fund and the Queen’s Nursing Institute. As a result of changes, made in 2009, to the way that community health services are commissioned – i.e. to a range of different types of provider – there will be a number of district nurses providing National Health Service funded services in organisations that do not provide a return to the Electronic Staff Record and therefore this data does not represent the full picture.</p><p>However we are not complacent, which is why Health Education England is exploring the capacity and capability requirement of our community workforce to best meet the future needs of the population. This will be set out in their workforce strategy later this year. In order to meet the growing need to increase the future supply of registered nurses including mental health, additional clinical placement funding was announced by the Department in August and October 2017. This will enable around 5,000 more nursing students to enter training each year from September 2018; a historic increase.</p><p>On 9 May, the Minister of State for Health (Stephen Barclay), also announced that postgraduate students who go on to work in mental health and learning disability fields, as well as those postgraduates who go on to work in community nursing roles, will receive £10,000 'golden hellos’. The Government announced £10 million to support this and we are currently considering how this is best delivered on the ground.</p>",,"Lord O'Shaughnessy","HL7894 ; HL7895 ; HL7896 ; HL7897 ; HL7970 ; HL7971","2018-05-30T12:19:39.477Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/905302/answer","Biography information for Lord O'Shaughnessy","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/905302/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/905302/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2018-05-15","Community Nurses","2","House of Lords","To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the impact of the decline in the number of district nurses from 7,716 in 2010 to 4,400 in 2016, reported by NHS Digital, on the treatment of wound care.","false","Biography information for Lord Hunt of Kings Heath",,"Lord Hunt of Kings Heath","HL7893"

The strategy outlines our response under four key themes: tackling county lines and misuse of drugs; early intervention and prevention; supporting communities and local partnerships; and an effective law enforcement and criminal justice response. The response is based on evidence about the trends and drivers of serious violence and analysis of what works in terms of interventions.</p><p>Our approach is not solely focused on law enforcement, very important as that is, but depends also on partnerships across a number of sectors such as education, health, social services, housing, youth services, victim services and others. In particular, the strategy stresses the importance of early intervention to tackle the root causes of serious violence and provide young people with the skills and resilience to lead productive lives free from violence.</p>","Louth and Horncastle","Victoria Atkins",,"2018-07-02T13:33:35.087Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904085/answer","Biography information for Victoria Atkins","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904085/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/904085/answer",,,,,"1","Home Office","Home Office","2018-05-14","Crimes of Violence: Gangs","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to the Summary Report for the Commission on Gangs and Violence: Uniting to Improve Safety by Reverend Dr Carver Anderson, published in November 2017, what steps he is taking to implement the recommendations in that report.","false","Biography information for Mr Andrew Mitchell","Sutton Coldfield","Mr Andrew Mitchell","143687"
