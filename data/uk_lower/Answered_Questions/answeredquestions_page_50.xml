Section 1 of the Localism Act 2011 also builds on existing powers to charge and to trade. If a local authority wishes to trade for a commercial purpose, this must be carried out through a company. Anyone has a right to request information from a public authority, including a company that is wholly owned by a public authority.</p><p>If a local authority receives a fee for services that it provides it will need to ensure that those transactions are accurately reflected in the annual financial accounts, which it is required to complete. The annual accounts should reflect requirements of the relevant accounting and reporting framework. Proper accounting practices for local authorities are set by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). Local authorities also need to comply with legislative requirements set out in statute. One specific requirement that local authorities are required to include in their accounts concerns related party transactions. These items should be shown as a disclosure note which supplements the core financial statements. However, it will only be disclosed where the transactions are material. In addition, local authorities complete annual statistical returns of their expenditure which are submitted to MHCLG. These returns should include all income that a local authority receives throughout the year including fees and charges.

In geography at key stage 3, pupils will look at how human and physical processes interact to influence and change landscapes, environments and the climate. In GCSE, science pupils will consider the evidence and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change.
