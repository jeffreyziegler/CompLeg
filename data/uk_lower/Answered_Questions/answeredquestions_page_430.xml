"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227487","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2015-03-23","<p>Our town centres and high streets have undergone dramatic changes over the last decade- the rise of online shopping, the effect of out of town retail parks and huge shifts in consumer spending patterns have all offered significant challenges. However, despite this, our high streets and town centres have fought back and up and down the country teams of local people are working hard to make our high streets great places to visit, live or work.</p><p> </p><p>A recent study from Southampton University showed how high streets are facing these challenges head on, meeting customers’ needs by offering a more convenient, creative and varied shopping experience, which increasingly offers more leisure opportunities.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, since 2010 national vacancy rates have continued to fall. Recent research by Deloitte showed that since 2009, high street vacancies as a result of high-profile administrations had been filled more successfully than those in out-of-town shopping centres and out-of-town retail parks.</p><p> </p><p>However the Government is not complacent and understands that the town centre needs to continue to evolve towards the provision of services and leisure alongside traditional retail. We are committed to supporting our high streets to embrace that change and to continue to hold their place at the heart of our communities.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has taken a number of significant steps to tackle vacant shops. We have relaxed planning rules to support “meanwhile use” as well as introducing new permitted development rights making it simpler to change use, so making it easier for businesses to respond to the needs of their communities.</p><p> </p><p>We have also taken forward a range of measures to tackle over-zealous parking enforcement that undermines the vitality of town centres, driving people out of town. We are restricting the use of CCTV ‘spy cars’ to enforce parking (through the Deregulation Bill currently going through Parliament). We have introduced 10 minute ‘grace periods’ when parking on-street allowing additional parking time before a late penalty is imposed, which will come into force in early April. We have published new statutory guidance allowing local people and businesses to demand a review of parking in their area, and we are reforming parking guidance so it is less heavy handed with motorists.</p><p> </p><p>The Government has also introduced a range of support for high streets through business rates. As well as offering business rate discounts to new occupants of previously empty shops, the Government has doubled Small Business Rate Relief for a further year (2015-16) and offered a 2% cap on the inflation increase for 2015-16, for the second year. This comes in addition to funding 50% of all local discounts granted, increasing the temporary discount for shops, pubs and restaurants with rateable values below £50,000 and offering a 100% rate relief for empty new builds. Finally, as announced at Autumn Statement 2014, the Government is also undertaking a long-term and wide-ranging review of business rates to ensure they are fit for purpose for a 21st century economy and allow our high streets to thrive.</p><p> </p><p>We have also championed the innovative use of vacant shops through <a href="http://thegreatbritishhighstreet.co.uk/high-street-of-the-year-award" target="_blank">the Great British High Street Competition.</a> A number of the entrants set out the innovative ways that they are tackling empty shops on the high streets and we have promoted their examples on the <a href="http://thegreatbritishhighstreet.co.uk/" target="_blank">Great British High Street Portal</a> and through documents such as <a href="http://thegreatbritishhighstreet.co.uk/pdf/GBHS-Celebrating-The-GB-High-Street.pdf" target="_blank">Celebrating the Great British High Street</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p>","Portsmouth North","Penny Mordaunt",,"2015-03-23T17:42:01.277Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227487/answer","Biography information for Penny Mordaunt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227487/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227487/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2015-03-16","Empty Property: Shops","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what steps his Department is taking to reduce the length of time that vacant shops remain empty.","false","Biography information for Dr Matthew Offord","Hendon","Dr Matthew Offord","227690"

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227496","Department for Communities and Local Government","false","2015-03-19","<p>It is not possible to introduce fitness regulations as part of the pension regulations in the absence of an agreed and universally applied national firefighter fitness standard in England. The statutory principles that we put in the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England came into force on 12 January 2015. To underpin these the National Employers have sought further discussion with the Fire Brigades Union in respect of additional guidance relating to the position already agreed in principle within the National Joint Council for Local Authority Fire and Rescue Services about the role fire authorities will take in supporting operational employees to maintain their fitness. In addition, the National Employers are looking to discuss with the unions, guidance on application of the factors set out in Pension Regulations for fire authority consideration in relation to Authority Initiated Early Retirement. Both approaches are expected to provide reassurance to operational employees that fire authorities will continue to treat their employees in a fair and consistent manner.</p><p>We will review the implementation of the National Framework principles in three years time and consider then whether further action is needed. In the meantime no firefighter will have to work beyond their current expected retirement date until 2022 at the earliest. Our expectation is that a firefighter of 55 or over who finds themselves in the situation of losing their fitness through no fault of their own, is unable to regain their fitness, and for whom there are no redeployment opportunities, should be offered an unreduced pension.</p><p>Where underlying medical reasons have been identified that restrict or prevent an individual from achieving the necessary fitness standards for undertaking their role as a firefighter, the individual should be referred to occupational health, and must receive the necessary support to facilitate a return to operational duties. The fire and rescue authority should also fully explore opportunities to enable the individual to remain in employment, including through reasonable adjustments and appropriate redeployment within the role, where it appears the medical condition prevents a return to operational duties. In those circumstances, where there are no such opportunities or suitable alternative employment is unavailable, then the fire and rescue authority will commence the formal assessment for ill-health retirement by referring the case to the Independent Qualified Medical Practitioner. Where it is determined that a firefighter is permanently unable to continue in their role as a firefighter they would become entitled to the immediate payment of a lower tier ill-health pension. In addition to this, they would also receive a higher tier ill-health enhancement if it was also determined that they could not undertake any regular employment. The definition of ill-health is wide, and includes both physical and mental conditions, including arthritis and post-traumatic stress syndrome. It is important to note that, where a firefighter is deemed eligible for medical retirement, the authority must pay the ill-health pension - there is no discretion.</p><p>Any firefighter will continue to be free to choose to retire from 55 onwards should they wish to, regardless of their fitness. In such circumstances, any benefits accrued in the 1992 and 2006 firefighters' pension schemes would be paid in full, while benefits earned in the 2015 scheme would be actuarially reduced by 21.8 per cent for a firefighter retiring on their birthday at 55, and reduced on a daily basis thereafter. The actuarial reduction of 21.8 per cent at age 55 compares very favourably with a reduction of over 40 per cent applied to firefighters at the same age in the 2006 scheme. The 2006 scheme also introduced a normal pension age of 60. Overall, our measures give firefighters one of the most generous pensions in the public sector and the strongest protections available for any public sector workforce on fitness and ageing.</p>","Portsmouth North","Penny Mordaunt",,"2015-03-19T13:06:16.833Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227496/answer","Biography information for Penny Mordaunt","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227496/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227496/answer",,,,,"7","Communities and Local Government","Communities and Local Government","2015-03-16","Fire and Rescue Services: Pensions","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, whether firefighters aged 55 who fail a fitness test will receive an unreduced pension; and whether he plans to bring in legislative proposals to make this a statutory right.","false","Biography information for Frank Field","Birkenhead","Mr Frank Field","227579"

The tablet should be in addition to the current allowance and should come with a SIM card. This provision of a tablet would replace any tablets available as part of the current select committee pilot. The laptop would come from the IT equipment allowance for Members provided by PICT.”</p><p>The gross cost was estimated to be around £200,000 per annum (including the cost of SIM cards) averaged over the life of the parliament but is linked to a programme to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication that is already delivering savings in excess of £3 million per year. These savings are expected to grow further in the new parliament.</p><p>An independent assessment was completed by Parliamentary ICT (PICT) in January 2015, covering comparative tablet costs, the costs associated with the re-working of existing services and infrastructure (where required), and any costs for training Members, Members’ staff and ICT support teams.</p><p>Having been in use across Parliament since 2012, iPads are integrated with current business processes (eg committee paper circulation) and infrastructure (eg mobile device management). A move away from the Apple operating system (iOS) at this time would incur costs to change these processes.</p><p>Given the established nature of iOS in the Houses’ IT service offering, access to parliamentary digital services on iPads is mature, offering greater access than on other mobile devices. Members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their iPads, they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of Office apps to access any content held within Office 365. In addition, PICT are able to remotely manage their security in the case of loss. While all of these services could be provided on other devices and operating systems, currently this would incur further costs in order to deliver them.</p><p>There would be a significant change to move existing Members to a different tablet operating system. There are at present 209 iPads supplied centrally to Members; PICT are experienced at supporting these. Any departure from iOS would require re-training for the current Members using iOS and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 Members and all relevant PICT support staff.</p><p>The assessment of the current marketplace revealed a wide range of prices, from entry level tablets starting at under £100, through to high-end tablets at approximately £600. Across this range, specifications and capabilities vary a great deal. Our requirements are for a secure, SIM-enabled tablet with a good life expectancy and capable of supporting future upgrades. The Apple iPad Air 2 meets these requirements and is competitively priced when compared with similar models.</p>","Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross","John Thurso","227498","2015-03-18T16:17:37.687Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227590/answer","Biography information for Viscount Thurso","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227590/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227590/answer",,,,,"18","House of Commons Commission","House of Commons Commission","2015-03-16","ICT","1","House of Commons","To ask the hon.

Potential uses are in the areas of diagnostics related to genome screening, clinical research, gene-discovery and wider use of stratified medicine. The technologies are hoped to provide more accurate variant calling and annotation pipelines, new ways of expressing the reference genomes, improving human leukocyte antigen genotyping and intuitive user interfaces to allow clinicians to interpret variants from next generation sequencing machines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NHS England SBRI Healthcare programme currently has 138 contracts with companies to develop innovative technologies to address known healthcare needs. These range from diagnostics to digital management solutions; embracing conditions such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia and patient safety and bringing solutions for mental health, primary and acute care. Assessment of the programme by the Office of Health Economics and the SBRI Healthcare team in 2014 has shown that since 2012 the pipeline has a potential to secure £434 million efficiency savings each year for the next decade. Assessment of the programme also shows that 150 jobs have been created, 31 patents awarded and over £10 million of additional investment has been leveraged.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The technologies supported include a light therapy sleep mask for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy; ultraviolet scope enabling intraoperative visibility of cancer cells in surgery; a point of care cardiac diagnostic to fully diagnose a heart attack within 20 minutes and a blood test to definitively rule out a diagnosis of colorectal cancer.</p><p> </p>","Battersea","Jane Ellison",,"2015-03-20T14:35:19.707Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227305/answer","Biography information for Jane Ellison","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227305/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/227305/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2015-03-13","Health Services: Technology","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what technologies are being developed with support from the Small Business Research Initiative programmes of (a) his Department and (b) NHS England; and what assessment he has made of the future potential uses of those technologies.","false","Biography information for Chuka Umunna","Streatham","Mr Chuka Umunna","227523"

The tablet should be in addition to the current allowance and should come with a SIM card. This provision of a tablet would replace any tablets available as part of the current select committee pilot. The laptop would come from the IT equipment allowance for Members provided by PICT.”</p><p>The gross cost was estimated to be around £200,000 per annum (including the cost of SIM cards) averaged over the life of the parliament but is linked to a programme to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication that is already delivering savings in excess of £3 million per year. These savings are expected to grow further in the new parliament.</p><p>An independent assessment was completed by Parliamentary ICT (PICT) in January 2015, covering comparative tablet costs, the costs associated with the re-working of existing services and infrastructure (where required), and any costs for training Members, Members’ staff and ICT support teams.</p><p>Having been in use across Parliament since 2012, iPads are integrated with current business processes (eg committee paper circulation) and infrastructure (eg mobile device management). A move away from the Apple operating system (iOS) at this time would incur costs to change these processes.</p><p>Given the established nature of iOS in the Houses’ IT service offering, access to parliamentary digital services on iPads is mature, offering greater access than on other mobile devices. Members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their iPads, they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of Office apps to access any content held within Office 365. In addition, PICT are able to remotely manage their security in the case of loss. While all of these services could be provided on other devices and operating systems, currently this would incur further costs in order to deliver them.</p><p>There would be a significant change to move existing Members to a different tablet operating system. There are at present 209 iPads supplied centrally to Members; PICT are experienced at supporting these. Any departure from iOS would require re-training for the current Members using iOS and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 Members and all relevant PICT support staff.</p><p>The assessment of the current marketplace revealed a wide range of prices, from entry level tablets starting at under £100, through to high-end tablets at approximately £600. Across this range, specifications and capabilities vary a great deal. Our requirements are for a secure, SIM-enabled tablet with a good life expectancy and capable of supporting future upgrades.
