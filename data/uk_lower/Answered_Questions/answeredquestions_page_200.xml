Therefore, Schedule 9 is focussed on work and employment in the widest sense rather than in the sphere of education. It does provide one exception in paragraph 3 of that Schedule which does have an impact on schools namely that it enables employers (including schools) to make religion or belief an occupational requirement for work in certain circumstances without breaching provisions of Part 5 of the Act.</p><p>Paragraph 4 of Schedule 22 set out a few exceptions from the provisions of the Equality Act for foundation schools, voluntary schools, academies and free schools, and independent schools that are not academies, where they have been designated as having a religious character.</p><p>The exceptions cover a range of situations relating to the appointment, promotion and remuneration of teachers by cross-referring to various sections in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 which cover these situations in the context of schools designated as having a religious character.

Such schools may take faith into account when employing teachers, for example. Our expectation is that schools with a religious character will balance the need to maintain the religious character of their school with that of securing the best staff for their school.

In the local care model, the system is organised at four different levels – general practice, cluster, local care hubs and west Kent-wide services. NHS England advises that there are seven ‘clusters’ of general practice in west Kent. Eight general practices form the Sevenoaks cluster; the third largest cluster in west Kent covering a registered population of 79,745.</p><p> </p><p>During 2017, the CCG has, working with health and care partners, developed and started the implementation of the service specification for a core cluster level team, focusing on prevention and planned care covering four main areas: frailty, end-of-life, dementia and mental health. In line with NHS England’s GP Five Year Forward View, the CCG is also working with clusters and practices to implement local programmes to help struggling practices, reduce workload, expand the workforce and also invest in technology and estates where needed.</p><p> </p><p>The cluster model is being implemented in three phases across the seven clusters. Phase 1 went live in October 2017, Phase 2 went live in November 2017 and Phase 3 is planned for April 2018. The practices in the Sevenoaks cluster were in Phase 2.

This is set out in the Skills Funding Letter 2017-18 which can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-funding-letter-april-2017-to-march-2018" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-funding-letter-april-2017-to-march-2018</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, in the Spring 2017 Budget, the government announced the investment of an additional £500 million per year in England’s technical education system once T levels have been fully rolled out. We announced £20 million to help providers prepare for the delivery of T levels and to help teachers prepare for these changes.</p><p> </p><p>In the first wave of reforms to technical education, we are focussing on developing T levels as high quality level 3 technical study programmes for 16 to 19 year olds. We will consider how we adapt T levels so they are appropriate for adult learners and will review technical provision at levels 4 and 5. On 30 November we published a consultation setting out proposals for T levels and the wider reformed technical education system. It seeks views on how best to implement the reforms to make sure they are a success and meet the aims of the Sainsbury Report and the Post-16 Skills Plan.</p>","Guildford","Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/800779/answer",,,,,,"2017-12-12T16:35:28.043Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/800779/answer","Biography information for Anne Milton","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/800779/answer",,,,,"60","Education","Education","2017-12-04","Vocational Education","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to page 11 of the Industrial Strategy, what assessment she has made of the effect of funding cuts to the Adult Skills Budget since 2010 on the ability to establish a technical education system that rivals the best in the world.","false","Biography information for Rebecca Long Bailey","Salford and Eccles","Rebecca Long Bailey","117400"

The statutory framework introduced in the Children and Families Act 2014 requires clinical commissioning groups and local authorities to work together to support the needs of children with a special educational need and disability. Commissioners must publish a transparent ‘local offer’ of services available which has been developed for, and with, parents and young people. Since May 2016, Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission have been inspecting local areas on their effectiveness in fulfilling their new duties for children and young people with special educational needs. NHS England is leading work to improve outcomes from commissioning of wheelchairs, including the National Wheelchair Data Collection, and the publication in July 2017 of a new service specification for wheelchair services.</p><p> </p><p>Children’s social care is the responsibility of the Department for Education. All disabled children are regarded as children ‘in need’ under the Children Act 1989 and may receive social care from the local authority. The Children and Families Act 2014 placed a duty on local authorities to assess whether a parent carer in their area has needs for support. A parent carer is defined as a person aged 18 or over who provides or intends to provide care for a disabled child for whom they have parental responsibility. An assessment must have regard to the parent carer’s well-being, must consider whether it is appropriate for the parent carer to continue to provide care for the disabled child in light of the parent carer’s needs for support, other needs and wishes, and must consider whether the parent carer has needs for support.</p><p> </p><p>Local authorities also provide short break services for disabled children, sometimes known as respite care, which also give their families and carers time to do normal things and take rest from care responsibilities. In April 2011, the Government introduced a statutory duty for all local authorities to provide a range of short breaks services, to consider carers’ needs in the design of these services and to publicise them clearly. While responsibility for funding short breaks rests with local authorities, the Department for Education has offered support and challenge and continues to consider how it can best support local authorities who are working to deliver sustainable short breaks provision.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>","Thurrock","Jackie Doyle-Price","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/798585/answer",,,,,,"2017-12-11T17:41:53.477Z",,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/798585/answer","Biography information for Jackie Doyle-Price","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/798585/answer",,,,,"17","Health","Health","2017-12-01","Children: Disability","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health, what steps his Department is taking to improve access to (a) health care and (b) social care for the families of disabled children.","false","Biography information for Richard Burden","Birmingham, Northfield","Richard Burden","116979"

We believe that the release of some of this information would risk identification of the individuals concerned. For this reason, MoJ has chosen not to provide an exact figure where the true number falls between one and five. However, it should not be assumed that the actual figure represented falls at any particular point within this scale; '≤5' is used as a replacement value from which it would be difficult to isolate or extract any individual data.</p><p> </p><p>It is important to stress that it is not possible to infer from an address in Wales that an individual considers themselves Welsh. HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) cannot identify English and Welsh prisoners. Someone with an address, for example in London, may well consider themselves to be Welsh, while someone with an address in Wales may not. UK nationals have a nationality of British. Therefore the data shown are not necessarily representative of those who identify as English or Welsh. The results are sorted by origin address (home address on reception into custody) and not nationality. English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish are not captured on our database as separate nationalities.</p><p> </p><p>Around 97% of prisoners have an origin location - i.e. addresses that are recorded in our central IT system. If no address is given, an offender’s committal court address is used as a proxy for the area in which they are resident. This information is included in the data provided in the tables above. Those with no recorded origin are typically foreign nationals or those recently received into custody. No address has been recorded and no court information is available for around 3% of all offenders; these figures are excluded from the tables attached.</p><p> </p><p>The numerical information provided has been drawn from administrative IT systems, which as with any large scale recording system are subject to possible error with data entry and processing.
